I have a problem statement that I would like you to help me solve using the Dynamic Programming algorithm. The problem statement is as follows:

=========
Task: Given a list of n juices, each with a price and a set of vitamins it contains, find the minimum total price of juices that Petya has to buy to obtain all three types of vitamins. Petya needs at least one juice containing each of the vitamins to obtain it. 

Input: The first line of input contains an integer n, representing the number of juices. The following n lines contain an integer ci and a string si, representing the price and the set of vitamins contained in the ith juice. The string si contains one to three characters, and the characters are either "A", "B", or "C". Each letter appears at most once in each string si.


Output: If it is impossible to obtain all three vitamins, print -1. Otherwise, print the minimum total price of juices that Petya has to buy to obtain all three vitamins.

Constraints: 1 <= n <= 1,000, 1 <= ci <= 100,000.
=========

To solve this problem, we will use the Dynamic Programming approach. Firstly, we need to identify the steps used in buiding a Dynamic Programming algorithm program. Then for each steps, kindly provide different three ideas of concrete implementation based on this problem. The desired outcome should be a tree structure, representing the overall process. Each node in the tree will be represented by a symbol, such as A1. The tree structure should include the main structure in the first field, while the subsequent fields will contain the symbol and the strategy defined for each stage.

You should return the tree in JSON format. The tree field will contain the overall tree structure, while each subsequent field will represent a stage of the problem denoted by a symbol (e.g., A1) and its corresponding strategy.

Task: Given a list of n juices, each with a price and a set of vitamins it contains, find the minimum total price of juices that Petya has to buy to obtain all three types of vitamins. Petya needs at least one juice containing each of the vitamins to obtain it. 

Input: The first line of input contains an integer n, representing the number of juices. The following n lines contain an integer ci and a string si, representing the price and the set of vitamins contained in the ith juice. The string si contains one to three characters, and the characters are either "A", "B", or "C". Each letter appears at most once in each string si.


Output: If it is impossible to obtain all three vitamins, print -1. Otherwise, print the minimum total price of juices that Petya has to buy to obtain all three vitamins.

Constraints: 1 <= n <= 1,000, 1 <= ci <= 100,000.
=========

To solve this problem, we will use the Dynamic Programming approach. Please list the most concise steps of build Dynamic Programming algorithm program based on this problem. And return the steps in a python list format.


### Outputs

```Python
steps = [
    "Create a list to store the minimum total price for each combination of vitamins.",
    "Initialize the list with a maximum value for all combinations except the combination of vitamins that are already present in a juice. Set the price for those combinations as the price of the juice.",
    "Iterate through each juice in the input list.",
    "For each juice, update the minimum total price for each combination of vitamins that can be obtained by adding the current juice.",
    "If a combination of vitamins already has a minimum total price, update it with the minimum value between the current price and the existing minimum price.",
    "After iterating through all the juices, check if there is a combination of vitamins that has a minimum total price and contains all three vitamins.",
    "If such a combination exists, return the minimum total price for that combination.",
    "If no combination exists, return -1 to indicate that it is impossible to obtain all three vitamins."
