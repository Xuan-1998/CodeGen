The plan is incorrect because the problem is not about dynamic programming. The problem is about finding a sequence $a$ such that we can split it into segments and write the length of each segment to the left or right of it to obtain sequence $b$. The sequence $b$ is a sequence of integers, and each integer represents the length of a segment in the original sequence $a$.

Here is the correct plan:
===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize two variables, `min` and `max`, both set to the first number in the sequence $b$.
2. Iterate over the sequence $b$ from the second number to the last. For each number:
   - If it is less than `min` or greater than `max`, print "NO" and return, because the current number cannot be the length of any segment.
   - Update `min` to be the current number and `max` to be the sum of all numbers so far, minus `min`.
3. If we have iterated over all numbers without returning, print "YES".
===END PLAN===

This plan works because each number in the sequence $b$ should represent the length of a segment in the original sequence $a$. Therefore, each number should be no less than the smallest number so far and no greater than the sum of all numbers so far. The `min` variable keeps track of the smallest number so far, and the `max` variable keeps track of the sum of all numbers so far, minus `min`. If we find a number that is less than `min` or greater than `max`, it means that this number cannot be the length of any segment, so we print "NO" and return. If we have iterated over all numbers without finding such a number, it means that all numbers can be the length of a segment, so we print "YES".
