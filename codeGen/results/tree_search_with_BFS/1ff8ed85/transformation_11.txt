The plan has a good direction but it seems to be missing a crucial element. The problem doesn't provide us with sequence 'a'. Instead, we are supposed to infer whether such a sequence 'a' could exist based on the given sequence 'b'. We can't directly check if there's a segment in 'a' that has length equal to 'b[i]', because we don't have 'a'. 

A possible approach could be to keep track of the maximum and minimum values we've seen so far in sequence 'b'. At each step, we can check if the current value is within the range of the maximum and minimum values we've seen so far. If it is, then it's possible that there could be a segment in 'a' of this length. If not, then it's not possible.

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. For each test case, initialize two variables, min_val and max_val, to keep track of the minimum and maximum values we've seen so far in sequence 'b'. Initialize both of them as 'b[0]'.
2. Iterate over the sequence 'b'. For each element 'b[i]', update min_val and max_val. min_val is the minimum of min_val and 'b[i]', and max_val is the maximum of max_val and 'b[i]'.
3. Check if 'b[i]' is within the range of min_val and max_val. If 'b[i]' is less than min_val or greater than max_val, print 'NO' and break the loop.
4. If we've iterated over the entire sequence without breaking the loop, print 'YES'.
===END PLAN===
