Your plan seems to be on the right track, but it might be overly complicated and inefficient for this problem. The main issue is that the transition step of checking all possible segments ending at index i would take O(n) time, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n^2), which is too slow given the constraints of the problem.

Here's a simplified plan:
1. Initialize two variables, `min` and `max`, to represent the minimum and maximum values of the sequence $a$ that can produce the sequence $b$. Set `min` and `max` to the first element of $b$.
2. Iterate through the sequence $b$ from the second element to the end. For each element $b_i$:
    a. If $b_i$ is less than `min` or greater than `max`, print "NO" and stop. This is because $b_i$ cannot be produced by splitting a segment of $a$ if it's outside the range of `min` and `max`.
    b. Update `min` and `max`. If $b_i$ is greater than the previous element $b_{i-1}$, then $b_i$ must be produced by splitting a segment of $a$ with value greater than or equal to $b_i$. So, set `max` to $b_i$ and `min` to $b_{i-1}$. Otherwise, if $b_i$ is less than or equal to $b_{i-1}$, then $b_i$ must be produced by splitting a segment of $a$ with value less than or equal to $b_i$. So, set `min` to $b_i$ and `max` to $b_{i-1}$.
3. If the entire sequence $b$ is iterated through without stopping, print "YES".

This plan has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), which are efficient enough for the problem's constraints. It also covers all possible cases, including when $b$ is an increasing or decreasing sequence, or contains equal elements.
