Your plan seems to be heading in the right direction, but there are a few issues. First, the problem doesn't seem to be a classic dynamic programming problem. The dynamic programming approach you suggested doesn't take into account that the sequence $a$ can be split into segments and the lengths of these segments can be written to the left or right of it. This means that the sequence $b$ could be a subsequence of $a$ and not necessarily the whole sequence. 

Also, your base case dp[0] = True might not always be correct. For example, if the first number in the sequence $b$ is greater than 1, then it cannot be obtained from an empty sequence $a$.

Here's an updated plan:

1. Iterate over the sequence $b$. Keep track of the minimum and maximum number encountered so far, min and max. Initially, min and max are both equal to $b_0$.

2. For each number $b_i$, update min and max. The new min is the previous min or $b_i$, whichever is smaller. The new max is the previous max or $b_i$, whichever is larger.

3. If at any point $b_i$ is greater than max + 1 or less than min - 1, print "NO" and stop. This means that $b_i$ cannot be obtained from a sequence $a$ that only contains numbers between min and max.

4. If you've iterated over the entire sequence $b$ and haven't stopped, print "YES". This means that every number in $b$ can be obtained from a sequence $a$ that only contains numbers between min and max.

This plan is simpler and more efficient than the dynamic programming approach. It has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), where n is the length of the sequence $b$. The dynamic programming approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(n), which is not feasible given the constraints of the problem.
