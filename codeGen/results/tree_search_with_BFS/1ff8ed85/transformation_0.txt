The plan you provided is a good starting point, but it seems to miss a crucial point in the problem statement. The problem asks whether sequence $b$ can be obtained from another sequence $a$ by splitting $a$ into segments and writing the length of each segment to the left or right of it. This means that the elements of sequence $b$ represent the lengths of the segments in sequence $a$. 

Given this, a dynamic programming approach might not be the most efficient or straightforward way to solve this problem, as it's not clear how we could define subproblems or transition between states. Instead, a more direct approach would be to iterate through the sequence and keep track of the minimum and maximum possible lengths of the next segment.

Here is a revised plan:

1. Initialize two variables, `min_length` and `max_length`, to represent the minimum and maximum possible lengths of the next segment. Initially, set `min_length` to 1 and `max_length` to the first element of sequence $b$.

2. Iterate through the sequence from the second element to the last. For each element:

   - If the current element is greater than `max_length`, print "NO" and break the loop. This is because the current element cannot be the length of a segment if it's greater than the maximum possible length.
   
   - If the current element is less than `min_length`, update `min_length` to the current element and `max_length` to the previous element minus 1. This is because the current element must be the length of the next segment, and the remaining part of the previous segment becomes the maximum possible length of the following segments.
   
   - Otherwise, update `min_length` to the current element and `max_length` to the maximum of the current `max_length` and the current element. This is because the current element can be the length of the next segment, and the maximum possible length of the following segments can be either the remaining part of the previous segment or the current element.

3. If the loop completes without breaking, print "YES". This means that all elements of sequence $b$ can be the lengths of some segments in sequence $a$.

This plan should cover all cases, including edge cases, as it considers each element of sequence $b$ and updates `min_length` and `max_length` accordingly. It also checks whether each element can be the length of a segment, which is the main condition in the problem statement.
