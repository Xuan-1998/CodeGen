The current plan you provided seems to be a general approach for dynamic programming problems. However, this problem might not need dynamic programming to solve it. 

Here is an updated plan:

1. For each test case, initialize two variables, `left` and `right`, to be the first integer of the sequence. These variables represent the maximum and minimum possible values that the next number in the original sequence could be.

2. Iterate through the sequence from the second number to the end. For each number:

    2.1. If it is smaller than `left` or larger than `right`, print "NO" and move on to the next test case.

    2.2. Update `left` and `right`. The new `left` is the current number if it is larger than the old `left`, and the new `right` is the current number plus the old `left` minus 1, if it is smaller than the old `right`.

3. If you have gone through the entire sequence without finding a number that is out of the `left` and `right` range, print "YES".

This approach works because each number in the sequence represents a segment of the original sequence, and the next number must be within the range of 1 to the current number plus the length of the segment that is not yet counted. The `left` and `right` variables keep track of this range. If a number is found to be out of this range, it means the sequence cannot be obtained from any original sequence by following the rules.
