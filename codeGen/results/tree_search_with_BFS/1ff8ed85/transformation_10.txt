The plan seems to be going in the right direction, but it lacks a key detail: how to transition from dp[i] to dp[j] where j > i. In other words, how to use the current state to calculate the next state. This transition is crucial for the dynamic programming approach. 

Also, the problem is not a typical dynamic programming problem. The sequence a is not given, and we don't have a clear way to split it into sub-problems. The sequence b can be seen as the result of some operations on sequence a, but since we don't know a, we can't directly apply dynamic programming.

Instead, we can solve this problem by keeping track of the maximum and minimum possible values that the next number in sequence a can take. For each number in sequence b, if it's within the range of the maximum and minimum possible values, then it's possible that this number is the length of a segment in sequence a. If not, then it's impossible to get sequence b from a, and we can print NO and stop the process.

Here is the updated plan:

1. Initialize two variables, `min_possible` and `max_possible`, to represent the minimum and maximum possible values that the next number in sequence a can take. Set `min_possible` to 1 and `max_possible` to b[1].
2. Iterate over the sequence b from the second number to the last. For each number b[i]:
   - If b[i] is less than `min_possible` or greater than `max_possible`, print NO and stop the process.
   - Set `min_possible` to max(b[i], `min_possible` - b[i-1]) and `max_possible` to min(b[i], `max_possible` + b[i-1]).
3. If all numbers in sequence b are within the range of `min_possible` and `max_possible`, print YES.

This plan is more efficient than the dynamic programming approach, because it only needs to iterate over the sequence b once. It also covers all possible cases, because it checks every number in sequence b.
