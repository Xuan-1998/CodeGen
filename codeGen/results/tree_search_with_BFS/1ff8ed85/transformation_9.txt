The plan you've provided seems to be a bit off. The problem is not about dynamic programming. Instead, it's about finding the maximum and minimum possible values at each position and comparing them with the given sequence. 

Here is the updated plan:

1. Initialize two variables, `maxVal` and `minVal`, to keep track of the maximum and minimum possible values at each position. 

2. Start from the first position and iterate through the sequence. For each position, update `maxVal` and `minVal` based on the previous maximum and minimum values and the current value in the sequence.

3. If at any position, `minVal` is greater than the current value in the sequence or `maxVal` is less than the current value in the sequence, then print "NO" and move to the next test case.

4. If you've iterated through the entire sequence without finding a contradiction, then print "YES".

This approach works because the minimum possible value at each position is the maximum value at the previous position, and the maximum possible value at each position is the sum of the maximum value at the previous position and the difference between the current and previous values in the sequence. If the current value in the sequence is outside this range, then it's impossible to obtain the sequence by splitting another sequence into segments and writing the length of each segment to the left or right of it.
