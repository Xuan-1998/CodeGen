Your plan is partially correct and it's a good attempt to solve the problem using Dynamic Programming. However, there are a few issues with your plan:

1. The time complexity of your plan is O(n^2), which is not efficient for this problem because n can be as large as 2 * 10^5. If we iterate over all j from 0 to i-1 for each i from 1 to n, the total number of operations can be up to n^2/2, which is approximately 10^10 when n = 2 * 10^5. This is too large for a program to handle within a reasonable amount of time.

2. Your plan did not take into account the constraint that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. This means that we need to handle multiple test cases efficiently.

3. The problem statement does not specify that the length of each segment of sequence a must be written to the left or right of it to form the i-th element of sequence b. Therefore, the condition "the sum of elements from j+1 to i equals b[i]" may not be correct.

Here is an updated version of the plan that should be more efficient and correct:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. For each test case, we keep track of the maximum and minimum element in the sequence b so far. We initialize the maximum and minimum element to be the first element of sequence b.

2. We iterate over the sequence b from the second element to the last element. For each element, we update the maximum and minimum element. If the current element is less than the minimum element or greater than the maximum element plus one, we print "NO" and move on to the next test case because the current element cannot be obtained from some sequence a by splitting a into segments and writing the length of each segment to the left or right of it.

3. If we have iterated over all elements of sequence b and have not printed "NO", we print "YES" because sequence b could be obtained from some sequence a.

4. We repeat steps 1-3 for each test case.
===END PLAN===
