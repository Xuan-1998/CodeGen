The intuition you've provided seems to be more suited for problems where we have to construct or find a sequence, which is not the case here. We're not constructing a sequence but rather checking if the given sequence can be obtained from some other sequence by following a specific rule. Hence, the dynamic programming approach might not be the best fit for this problem.

Instead, we can solve this problem using a different approach. Here's a new plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. For each test case, we need to keep track of the maximum number we've encountered so far and the sum of all numbers up to the current position. We'll call these `max_so_far` and `total_sum` respectively.

2. We initialize `max_so_far` with the first number in the sequence and `total_sum` with the sum of the first two numbers in the sequence.

3. We then iterate through the sequence from the second number onwards. For each number, we update `max_so_far` if the current number is greater than `max_so_far` and update `total_sum` by adding the current number to it.

4. After updating `max_so_far` and `total_sum`, we check if `total_sum` is less than or equal to `max_so_far`. If it is, we print "NO" and move on to the next test case because it's not possible to obtain the current sequence from any other sequence following the given rule.

5. If we've iterated through the entire sequence and `total_sum` is always greater than `max_so_far`, we print "YES" because it's possible to obtain the current sequence from some other sequence following the given rule.
===END PLAN===

This approach works because if at any point the sum of all numbers up to a certain position is less than or equal to the maximum number we've encountered so far, it means that we can't split any sequence into segments such that the length of each segment is written to the left or right of it to obtain the current sequence. This is because the sum of all numbers up to a certain position represents the total length of all segments we've encountered so far and the maximum number we've encountered so far represents the length of the longest segment. If the total length of all segments is less than or equal to the length of the longest segment, it means that we've encountered a segment whose length is longer than the total length of all segments, which is not possible.
