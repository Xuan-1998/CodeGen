The plan is not correct. 

This problem is not about dynamic programming. It's about maintaining two pointers and track the maximum and minimum of the sequence. 

Here is the corrected plan:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the ends of the sequence. Also initialize two variables, `max` and `min`, to keep track of the maximum and minimum values of the sequence.

2. Iterate while `left` is less than `right`:

    - If `b[left]` is not equal to `max` or `b[right]` is not equal to `min`, print "NO" and break the loop. This is because the sequence can only be obtained by splitting `a` into segments and writing the length of each segment to the left or right of it if the maximum and minimum values of the sequence are at the ends of the sequence.
    
    - Update `max` and `min` to be the maximum and minimum values of `b[left]` and `b[right]`, respectively.
    
    - Increment `left` and decrement `right`.

3. If `left` is equal to `right`, print "YES". This is because we have checked all elements of the sequence and they all satisfy the condition.

This plan is more efficient than the original plan because it only requires a single pass through the sequence. It also correctly handles the case where the sequence cannot be obtained from `a` by splitting it into segments and writing the length of each segment to the left or right of it.
