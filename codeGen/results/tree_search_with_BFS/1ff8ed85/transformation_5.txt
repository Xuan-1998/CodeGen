Your plan of using dynamic programming is a good starting point, but it seems to have a few issues. 
First, the problem doesn't have an optimal substructure, which is a key property that a problem must have to be solved using dynamic programming. The optimal substructure property states that an optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems. However, the problem doesn't seem to have this property because the condition for a sequence to be obtained from another sequence doesn't depend on whether its subsequence can be obtained from another sequence.

Second, the plan doesn't seem to consider the constraints of the problem. The constraints $1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$ and $1 \le b_i \le 10^9$ mean that the time complexity of the solution should be linear or linearithmic. However, the plan seems to have a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ because it checks all previous states for each state, which would be too slow.

Here is a new plan:
1. For each test case, maintain two variables, `left` and `right`, which represent the possible range of the next number in sequence `a`. Initialize `left` as 1 and `right` as `b[1]`.
2. Iterate over the sequence `b` from the second number. For each number `b[i]`, if it's not in the range `[left, right]`, print "NO" and break the loop.
3. If `b[i]` is in the range `[left, right]`, update `left` and `right`. `left` is updated to `max(left, b[i])` and `right` is updated to `right + b[i-1] - min(right, b[i-1])`.
4. If the loop finishes without breaking, print "YES".
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for all test cases.

This plan has a time complexity of $O(n)$ for each test case, which meets the constraints of the problem. It considers the fact that each number in sequence `b` represents the length of a segment in sequence `a`, and the segments can be written to the left or right of it. Therefore, it covers all possible cases.
