Your plan seems to be on the right track, but there seems to be a misunderstanding of the problem. This problem is not a typical dynamic programming problem because it does not require solving subproblems or storing intermediate results. We need to check if the sequence can be obtained by splitting another sequence into segments and writing the length of each segment to the left or right of it. 

Here's a more suitable plan:
1. Keep track of two variables, `min` and `max`, which represent the smallest and largest possible numbers in the original sequence `a` that we can currently be at.
2. Iterate through the input sequence `b` from left to right. For each number `b[i]`, if it's greater than `max` or less than `min`, print 'NO' and break the loop because `b[i]` cannot be a valid segment length.
3. If `b[i]` is within the range `[min, max]`, it could be a valid segment length. Update `min` and `max` accordingly for the next iteration. If `b[i]` is equal to `max`, set `min` to `max` and `max` to `b[i+1]` (or `b[i]` if `i+1` is out of bounds). If `b[i]` is less than `max`, set `min` to `b[i]` and `max` to `max`.
4. If we've iterated through the entire sequence without breaking the loop, print 'YES' because the sequence `b` could be obtained from some sequence `a`.

This plan works because it checks if each number in `b` could be a valid segment length based on the previous numbers, which is exactly what the problem asks us to do. It also takes into account that the segments can be written to the left or right of the original sequence, which is why we keep track of a range `[min, max]` instead of a single number.
