Your plan is a good start, but it has a few issues. Firstly, the problem doesn't seem to be a typical Dynamic Programming problem because there isn't a clear way to break it down into subproblems. Also, the condition you've set for transitioning between states in your DP solution (i.e., "for each b[i], check if there exists a j < i such that dp(j) is true and b[j] + 1 <= b[i]") doesn't seem to align with the problem statement.

Instead, the problem can be solved using two pointers and a greedy approach. Here's an updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. For each test case, initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to point to the first and last elements of the sequence respectively.
2. Initialize two variables, `maxLeft` and `maxRight`, to store the maximum values encountered so far from the left and right sides of the sequence respectively. Set both of them to the first element of the sequence.
3. Move the `left` and `right` pointers towards the center of the sequence one step at a time. At each step, update `maxLeft` and `maxRight` with the maximum value encountered so far from the left and right sides respectively.
4. If at any point `maxLeft` or `maxRight` becomes greater than the current value pointed to by the `left` or `right` pointer respectively, print "NO" and break the loop. This is because the current value cannot be a segment length as it is less than a previous segment length, which violates the condition that the lengths of the segments are non-decreasing.
5. If the `left` and `right` pointers meet in the middle without breaking the loop, print "YES". This means that the sequence can be obtained by splitting another sequence into segments and writing the length of each segment to the left or right of it.
===END PLAN===

This plan is more efficient than the original one as it has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1). It also covers all edge cases as it checks every element in the sequence.
