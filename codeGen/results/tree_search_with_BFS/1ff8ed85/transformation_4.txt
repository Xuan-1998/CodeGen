I appreciate your effort in coming up with a plan, but I think your approach might not work for this problem. The reason is that the problem does not require finding a subsequence in `b` that could be obtained from some sequence `a`. Instead, it requires finding whether `b` could be obtained from `a` by splitting `a` into segments and writing the length of each segment to the left or right of it.

Here is an updated plan:

1. For each test case, we will keep track of the maximum and minimum values that we have seen so far in the sequence. We'll call these `max_seen` and `min_seen`.

2. We'll iterate over the sequence from left to right. For each number `b[i]`, if it's greater than `max_seen`, then we update `max_seen` to `b[i]`. If it's less than `min_seen`, then we update `min_seen` to `b[i]`.

3. After updating `max_seen` and `min_seen`, we check if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `max_seen` and greater than or equal to `min_seen`. If it's not, then we print 'NO' and move on to the next test case.

4. If we've iterated over the entire sequence without finding any number that doesn't meet the condition in step 3, then we print 'YES'.

This plan takes advantage of the fact that the sequence `b` can only be obtained from `a` if each number in `b` is within the range of numbers we've seen so far in the sequence. It's also efficient because it only requires a single pass over the sequence, and it uses a constant amount of extra space to keep track of `max_seen` and `min_seen`.
