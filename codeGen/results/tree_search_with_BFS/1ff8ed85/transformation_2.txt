Your plan seems to be on the right track with dynamic programming, but it might be more complex than necessary. The problem can be solved in linear time using a greedy approach.

Here's a revised plan:

1. Initialize two variables, `max1` and `max2`, to keep track of the maximum number we have seen so far in the sequence and the maximum number we expect to see in the next segment, respectively. We set `max1` to `b[0]` and `max2` to `0`.

2. Iterate through the sequence from the second element to the last. For each number `b[i]`:

   - If `b[i]` is greater than `max2`, it means we have started a new segment. Update `max2` to this new value and `max1` to the previous `max2`.
   
   - If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `max2` but greater than `max1`, it means we are still in the same segment. Update `max2` to the maximum of `max2` and `b[i]`.
   
   - If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `max1`, it means the sequence cannot be obtained from another sequence by the given rule. Print "NO" and stop the process.

3. If we make it through the entire sequence without stopping, print "YES".

This approach works because we are essentially trying to find out if the sequence can be split into segments such that each segment's maximum number is less than or equal to the maximum number of the next segment. This is guaranteed if the sequence follows the rules outlined in the plan.

This plan handles all edge cases since we are considering each number in the sequence. The time complexity is O(n), which is efficient for the input size.
