The plan you provided seems to be a good starting point, but there are a few things that might not work as expected. Specifically, the condition "b[j] + 1 <= b[i]" does not seem to ensure that the sequence b can be obtained from some sequence a by splitting a into segments and writing the length of each segment to the left or right of it.

Here's an updated plan based on your original one and the problem statement:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State Expression: We will maintain two variables, `left` and `right`, to keep track of the smallest and largest possible values for the next element in sequence a.

2. Initialization: Initially, `left` and `right` are both set to b[0] because the first element of sequence a must be b[0].

3. Iteration: Iterate through the sequence b from 1 to n-1. For each b[i]:

    a. If b[i] is not within the range [left, right], print NO and break the loop.
    
    b. Update `left` and `right`. If b[i] > b[i-1], then the new `left` is b[i] and the new `right` is `right` + b[i] - b[i-1]. If b[i] <= b[i-1], then the new `left` is 1 and the new `right` is b[i-1].
    
4. If you reach the end of the sequence without breaking the loop, print YES.
===END PLAN===

This plan uses a greedy approach: it always tries to maximize the range of possible values for the next element in sequence a. It checks whether each element in sequence b is within this range, and updates the range based on the current and previous elements in sequence b. It does not use dynamic programming because it does not need to remember the results of previous computations, just the current range of possible values.
