The plan you provided seems to be a general approach for dynamic programming problems. However, this problem doesn't seem to require a dynamic programming approach. Instead, it can be solved by keeping track of the maximum and minimum possible values of the elements in the sequence $a$ as we iterate through the sequence $b$.

Here is an updated plan:
===BEGIN PLAN===
1. For each test case, initialize two variables, `min` and `max`, to represent the minimum and maximum possible values of the elements in the sequence $a$. Set `min` to 1 and `max` to $b_1$.
2. Iterate through the sequence $b$ from the second element to the last. For each $b_i$:
   1. If $b_i$ is less than `min` or greater than `max`, print "NO" and go to the next test case. This is because it's impossible to obtain $b_i$ from any segment of $a$ if $b_i$ is not within the range [`min`, `max`].
   2. Update `min` and `max` based on $b_i$ and $b_{i+1}$ (if $b_{i+1}$ exists). Specifically, if $b_i$ is greater than or equal to $b_{i+1}$, set `max` to $b_i$ and `min` to $b_{i+1}$. Otherwise, set `min` to $b_i$ and `max` to $b_i$.
3. If we've iterated through the entire sequence $b$ without printing "NO", print "YES".
===END PLAN===

This plan works because the length of each segment of $a$ must be within the range [`min`, `max`]. The `min` and `max` values are updated based on the current and next elements of $b$ to ensure this condition is always met. If we encounter a $b_i$ that is not within the range [`min`, `max`], it means that there's no way to split $a$ into segments to obtain $b$, so we print "NO" and go to the next test case.
