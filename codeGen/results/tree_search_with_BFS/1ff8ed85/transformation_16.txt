The plan seems to be on the right track, but it's missing a crucial detail. The problem is not asking whether we can form sequence b from any sequence a. Instead, it's asking if we can form sequence b from sequence a by splitting a into segments and writing the length of each segment to the left or right of it. This means we should keep track of the maximum and minimum numbers we have seen so far in the sequence a, as well as the next number in sequence b we are trying to match. 

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize two variables, `minNum` and `maxNum`, to represent the minimum and maximum numbers we have seen so far in the sequence a. Set both of them to 1 initially.
2. Iterate through the sequence b from left to right. For each number `b[i]` in the sequence b:
    - If `b[i]` is less than `minNum` or greater than `maxNum`, print 'NO' and break the loop. This is because if `b[i]` is less than `minNum`, there is no way we can get `b[i]` from a segment of sequence a since all numbers we have seen so far are greater than `b[i]`. Similarly, if `b[i]` is greater than `maxNum`, we can't get `b[i]` from a segment of sequence a since all numbers we have seen so far are less than `b[i]`.
    - Update `minNum` and `maxNum` based on `b[i]`. If `b[i]` is equal to `maxNum`, then `minNum` should be updated to `maxNum + 1`. If `b[i]` is equal to `minNum`, then `maxNum` should be updated to `minNum + 1`.
3. If we have iterated through the entire sequence b without breaking the loop, print 'YES'.
===END PLAN===

This plan is more efficient than the original plan because it only requires a single pass through the sequence b and uses a constant amount of space. It also covers all possible cases because it checks whether each number in sequence b can be obtained from a segment of sequence a based on the numbers we have seen so far.
