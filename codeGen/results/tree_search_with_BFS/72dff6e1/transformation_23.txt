1. State Expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid sequences of length i where the last element is j. Base Case: dp[0][0] = 1, as an empty sequence is valid.
2. State Update: For each i from 1 to N, and for each j from 1 to N, update dp[i][j] by considering all valid k from the previous state dp[i-1][k] where k != j and occurrences of k and j are within the limits specified by A.
3. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This approach builds up the solution by solving smaller subproblems first and using their results to solve larger subproblems, typically using a table to store intermediate results. Time complexity: O(N^2), space complexity: O(N^2).
4. Iterate through all possible sequences and ensure that the number of occurrences of each element i in the sequence does not exceed A[i].
5. The final answer will be the sum of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to N, modulo 998244353.
