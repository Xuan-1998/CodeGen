===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State Expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid sequences of length i where the last element is j.
2. Initialization: Initialize dp[0][0] = 1 as the base case since an empty sequence is valid. For all other dp[0][j] where j != 0, initialize to 0 as there are no valid sequences of length 0 with non-zero elements.
3. Transition: For each length i from 1 to N, and for each element j from 1 to N:
   - Calculate the number of valid sequences of length i ending with j by considering adding j to all valid sequences of length i-1.
   - Ensure that the addition of j does not violate the constraints given by the array A.
4. Summation: The final answer will be the sum of all dp[N][j] for j from 1 to N, modulo 998244353.
5. Edge Cases: Consider edge cases where N=1, and where all elements of A are 1.
