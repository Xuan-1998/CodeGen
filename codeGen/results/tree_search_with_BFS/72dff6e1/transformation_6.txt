1. Define a DP table dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the number of valid sequences of length i where the last number is j.
2. Initialize the DP table: For i = 1, dp[1][j] = 1 for all j from 1 to N, since any single element sequence is valid if it satisfies the given conditions.
3. Transition: For each length i from 2 to N, and for each number j from 1 to N:
   a. Calculate the number of valid sequences of length i ending with j by considering the sequences of length i-1 ending with any number k from 1 to N.
   b. Ensure that the number of occurrences of j in the sequence does not exceed A[j] and that the number of occurrences of k in the sequence does not exceed A[k].
   c. Update dp[i][j] accordingly.
4. The final answer is the sum of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to N, modulo 998244353.
5. Edge cases: Ensure to handle the cases where N = 1 and where A[i] = 1 for all i.
