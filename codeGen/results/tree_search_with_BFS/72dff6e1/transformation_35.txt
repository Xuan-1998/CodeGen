===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define the problem as a Dynamic Programming (DP) problem.
2. Use a bottom-up strategy with tabulation to build the solution.
3. Define the state expression: Let dp[i][j] denote the number of valid sequences of length i using the first j elements.
4. Base Case: dp[0][0] = 1, as there is exactly one way to form an empty sequence.
5. Transition: For each i from 1 to N and for each j from 1 to N:
   - dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(j) if A[j-1] >= i).
6. The final answer will be the sum of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to N, modulo 998244353.
7. Handle edge cases such as the smallest possible values of N and A.
8. Ensure that the solution adheres to the constraints and efficiently computes the result within the given limits.
