===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State Expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid sequences of length i where the last element is j. Initialize dp[0][0] = 1, as an empty sequence is valid.
2. State Update: For each i from 1 to N, and for each j from 1 to N, update dp[i][j] by considering all valid k from the previous state dp[i-1][k] where k != j and occurrences of k and j are within the limits specified by A.
3. Transition: For each i from 1 to N, for each j from 1 to N:
   - Initialize dp[i][j] to 0.
   - For each k from 1 to N:
     - If k != j and occurrences of k and j are within the limits specified by A:
       - dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][k]
   - Take modulo 998244353 for dp[i][j].
4. Result: Sum up all dp[N][j] for j from 1 to N to get the final result.
5. Edge Cases: Handle cases where N=1 separately, as the sequence can only be [1].
6. Complexity: Time complexity is O(N^3) due to the triple nested loops, and space complexity is O(N^2) for the dp table.
