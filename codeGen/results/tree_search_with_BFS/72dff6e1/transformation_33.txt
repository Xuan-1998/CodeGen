1. State Expression: Let dp[i][j] denote the number of valid sequences of length i using the first j elements. Base Case: dp[0][0] = 1, as there is exactly one way to form an empty sequence.
2. Transition: For each i from 1 to N and each j from 1 to N, update dp[i][j] by considering all previous states dp[i-1][k] where k ranges from 0 to j-1, and ensure that A[j-1] >= i.
3. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: Build up the solution by solving smaller subproblems first and using their results to solve larger subproblems, typically using a table to store intermediate results. Time complexity: O(N^2), space complexity: O(N^2).
4. Final answer: The result will be the sum of dp[N][j] for all j from 0 to N-1, modulo 998244353.
5. Handle edge cases: Consider the smallest inputs (N=1) and ensure the approach works for maximum constraints.
