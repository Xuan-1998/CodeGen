1. State Expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid sequences of length i where the last element is j. Base Case: dp[0][0] = 1, as an empty sequence is valid.
2. State Transition: dp[i][j] can be computed by summing up dp[i-1][k] for all k such that k != j and occurrences of k in the sequence are within limits. This means we need to check that adding element j does not violate the condition that the number of occurrences of j in the sequence should be at most A[j-1].
3. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This approach builds up the solution by solving smaller subproblems first and using their results to solve larger subproblems, typically using a table to store intermediate results. Time complexity: O(N^3), space complexity: O(N^2).
4. Initialize the dp table: Create a 2D dp table where dp[i][j] represents the number of valid sequences of length i ending with element j.
5. Iterate over the length of the sequence from 1 to N and for each length, iterate over the possible last elements from 1 to N. For each pair (i, j), update dp[i][j] based on the state transition.
6. Compute the result: The final result is the sum of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to N, as we need the total number of valid sequences of length N.
7. Handle edge cases: Ensure that the solution works for the smallest input size N = 1.
