===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
1. Define the Dynamic Programming (DP) table: Let dp[i][j] denote the number of valid sequences of length i using the first j elements.
2. Base Case: Initialize dp[0][0] = 1, as there is exactly one way to form an empty sequence.
3. Transition: For each i from 1 to N and for each j from 1 to N:
   a. Initialize dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] (this accounts for sequences of length i using the first j-1 elements).
   b. If A[j-1] >= i (i.e., the j-th element can be used i times), add dp[i-1][j-1] to dp[i][j].
4. The final answer is dp[N][N] modulo 998244353.
5. Edge Cases: Ensure that the input values are within the given constraints (1 ≤ N ≤ 500 and 1 ≤ A_i ≤ N).
