1. State Expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid sequences of length i where the last element is j.
2. Initialization: Initialize dp[0][0] = 1 as the base case since an empty sequence is valid. For all other dp[0][j] where j != 0, initialize to 0 as there are no valid sequences of length 0 with non-zero elements.
3. Recurrence Relation: For each length i from 1 to N, and for each possible last element j from 1 to N, calculate dp[i][j] based on the previous states. Specifically, dp[i][j] can be obtained by summing up dp[i-1][k] for all k from 1 to N, only if the number of occurrences of k in the sequence is within the limit specified by the array A.
4. Modulo Operation: Since the result needs to be modulo 998244353, ensure that every update to the dp array is taken modulo 998244353.
5. Final Calculation: Sum up all dp[N][j] for j from 1 to N to get the total number of valid sequences of length N.
6. Edge Cases: Ensure that the solution handles the minimum input size N = 1 and the case where all A_i are equal to N.
