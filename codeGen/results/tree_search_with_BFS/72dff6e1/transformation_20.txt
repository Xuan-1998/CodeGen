1. State Expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid sequences of length i where the last element is j. Base Case: dp[0][0] = 1, as an empty sequence is valid.
2. State Transition: For each i from 1 to N and each j from 1 to N:
   - dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k] for all k such that k != j and occurrences of k in the sequence are within limits).
3. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This approach builds up the solution by solving smaller subproblems first and using their results to solve larger subproblems, typically using a table to store intermediate results. Time complexity: O(N^2), space complexity: O(N^2).
4. Initialize dp[0][0] = 1, and other dp[0][j] = 0 for j != 0.
5. Iterate over the length of the sequence from 1 to N.
6. For each length, iterate over each possible last element from 1 to N.
7. For each last element, calculate the number of valid sequences by summing up the valid sequences of length (i-1) with different last elements.
8. Ensure that the occurrences of each element in the sequence are within the limits specified by the array A.
9. Sum up the values of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to N to get the final result.
10. Print the result modulo 998244353.
