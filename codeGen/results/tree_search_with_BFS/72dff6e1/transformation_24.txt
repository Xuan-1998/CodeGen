===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define the problem in terms of Dynamic Programming with a bottom-up strategy using tabulation. This approach builds up the solution by solving smaller subproblems first and using their results to solve larger subproblems, typically using a table to store intermediate results. Time complexity: O(N^2), space complexity: O(N^2).
2. State Expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid sequences of length i where the last element is j. 
3. Base Case: Initialize dp[0][0] = 1, as an empty sequence is valid. For all other dp[0][j] where j > 0, initialize to 0.
4. State Update: For each i from 1 to N, and for each j from 1 to N, update dp[i][j] by considering all valid k from the previous state dp[i-1][k] where k != j and occurrences of k and j are within the limits specified by A.
5. Specifically, for each i from 1 to N:
    a. For each j from 1 to N:
        i. Set dp[i][j] to 0.
        ii. For each k from 1 to N:
            - If k != j and the occurrences of k and j are within the limits specified by A, update dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][k].
            - Apply modulo 998244353 to keep the values manageable.
6. The final answer will be the sum of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to N, modulo 998244353.
7. Edge Cases: Consider edge cases where N=1, all A[i] are 1, and where A[i] are at their maximum values.
