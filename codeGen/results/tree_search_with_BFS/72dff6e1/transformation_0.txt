1. Define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of valid sequences of length i where the last number is j.
2. Initialize the dp array. For sequences of length 1, dp[1][j] = 1 if j <= A[j], otherwise dp[1][j] = 0.
3. Iterate over the length of the sequence from 2 to N.
4. For each length i, iterate over the possible last number j from 1 to N.
5. For each j, calculate the number of valid sequences by summing up dp[i-1][k] for all k from 1 to N where k is a valid number that can appear before j in the sequence.
6. Ensure that the number of occurrences of each number in the sequence does not exceed the corresponding value in A.
7. Use modulo 998244353 to keep the results within the required range.
8. The final answer will be the sum of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to N.
