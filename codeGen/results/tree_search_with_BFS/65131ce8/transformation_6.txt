1. Define the problem as a dynamic programming problem with a state expression dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to form a tree with i nodes and j good vertices.
2. Initialize the base cases for the DP table. For example, dp[1][1] = 1 since there's only one way to form a tree with one node and one good vertex.
3. Use a top-down approach with memoization to fill the DP table. This involves recursively breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations.
4. For each node, compute the number of ways to distribute the remaining nodes among its children and sum these possibilities to update dp[i][j]. This requires considering all possible distributions of nodes among the children and how the subtrees contribute to the overall structure.
5. Ensure the state transitions correctly account for the out-degree constraints given by the sequence d. Specifically, for each node, the sum of the out-degrees of its children must match the out-degree specified in d.
6. Iterate through all possible numbers of nodes and good vertices, updating the DP table based on the contributions of subtrees rooted at various nodes.
7. Sum the values in the DP table that correspond to valid trees (those that satisfy the out-degree constraints) to obtain the final result.
8. Return the sum of the numbers of good vertices for all good trees, modulo 998244353.
9. Handle edge cases such as the minimum and maximum values of N and d, ensuring the solution is robust and efficient for all inputs within the given constraints.
