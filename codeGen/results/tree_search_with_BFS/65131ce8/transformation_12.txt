1. Understand the Problem: We need to calculate the sum of the numbers of good vertices for all good trees that can be formed given the sequence of out-degrees.

2. Dynamic Programming Approach:
   - Define dp[i][j] to represent the number of ways to form a subtree with i vertices and j good vertices.
   - Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1 (a single node is trivially a good vertex), dp[1][0] = 0 (we can't have a tree with one node and zero good vertices).
   - Transition Relationship: To compute dp[i][j], consider adding a new vertex to an existing subtree.
     - For each k (0 <= k <= i-1):
       - dp[i][j] += dp[k][j-1] * C(i-1, k) (adding the new vertex as a good vertex)
       - dp[i][j] += dp[k][j] * C(i-1, k) (adding the new vertex as a non-good vertex)
     - C(i-1, k) is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose k vertices from i-1 vertices.
   - Compute the binomial coefficients using Pascal's triangle or a precomputed table for efficiency.

3. Implementation Steps:
   - Parse the input to get N and the sequence d.
   - Initialize the dp table with dimensions (N+1) x (N+1).
   - Initialize the base case: dp[1][1] = 1, dp[1][0] = 0.
   - Precompute the binomial coefficients up to N using Pascal's triangle.
   - Fill the dp table using the transition relationship.
   - Sum up the values of dp[N][j] for all j to get the final result.
   - Print the result modulo 998244353.

4. Edge Cases:
   - Ensure the input sequence d sums to N-1.
   - Handle cases where d contains zeros appropriately.
   - Validate that the input constraints are respected.

5. Optimization Considerations:
   - Use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and avoid overflow.
   - Optimize the computation of binomial coefficients to avoid redundant calculations.
