1. Problem Understanding:
   - We need to find the sum of the numbers of good vertices for all good trees that can be formed with given out-degrees.
   - A good tree is one where the out-degree of vertex i is d_i.
   - A good vertex v is one where the minimum vertex number in its subtree is v.

2. Plan:
   - Dynamic Programming Approach:
     1. Define dp[i][j] as the number of ways to form a tree with i nodes such that there are j good vertices.
     2. Initialize dp[0][0] = 1 as the base case (a tree with 0 nodes has 1 way to be formed with 0 good vertices).
     3. Iterate over the number of nodes from 1 to N.
     4. For each node i, iterate over all possible numbers of nodes and good vertices in its subtrees.
     5. Use these subtrees to update dp[i][j] by considering how the subtrees combine to form the larger tree.
     6. Use memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant computations.
     7. Consider the constraints and edge cases, such as:
        - N = 2 (minimum case)
        - All d_i are 0 (tree with no children except the root)
        - d_1 is always >= 1 (root has at least one child)

3. Steps:
   1. Parse the input to get N and the array d.
   2. Initialize the dp array with dimensions (N+1) x (N+1) to store the number of ways to form trees.
   3. Iterate through all possible subtree sizes and update the dp array accordingly.
   4. Calculate the sum of good vertices for all good trees using the dp array.
   5. Return the result modulo 998244353.

4. Edge Cases:
   - Minimum input values (N = 2, d = [1, 0])
   - All out-degrees are zero except the root
   - Maximum input values within constraints
