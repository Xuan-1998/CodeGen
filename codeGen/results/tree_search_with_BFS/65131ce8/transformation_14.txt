1. Define the problem using a Dynamic Programming (DP) approach.
2. Create a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to construct a tree with `i` nodes and `j` good vertices.
3. Initialize the base cases:
   a. `dp[1][1] = 1` (a single node tree with one good vertex).
   b. `dp[1][0] = 0` (a single node tree cannot have zero good vertices).
4. Iterate over the number of nodes from 2 to N:
   a. For each node count `i`, iterate over the number of good vertices `j` from 1 to i:
      i. Calculate the possible number of good vertices in the subtree rooted at the current node.
      ii. Use the memoized results to build the current solution.
5. Ensure the constraints are respected, particularly the sum of out-degrees being N-1.
6. Calculate and return the sum of the numbers of good vertices for all good trees modulo 998244353.
