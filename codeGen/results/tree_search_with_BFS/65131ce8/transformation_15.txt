1. Understand the problem constraints and requirements: We need to count the number of good vertices in all possible good trees that can be formed given the out-degree sequence `d`.

2. Define the DP state: Let `dp[i][j]` be the number of ways to form a subtree rooted at vertex `i` with exactly `j` good vertices. Initialize an array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents this state.

3. Base Case: For a single node tree, `dp[1][1] = 1` (since a single node is trivially a good vertex), and `dp[1][0] = 0` (since we can't have a tree with one node and zero good vertices).

4. Recursive Case: For each vertex `i`, consider its children. If vertex `i` has `d_i` children, distribute the good vertices among the children. Use combinatorial methods to count the ways to distribute the good vertices among the children.

5. Transition: For each child `c` of vertex `i`, update the DP table by combining the states of the subtrees rooted at each child. This involves summing up the ways to distribute the good vertices among the children and considering vertex `i` as a good vertex if it satisfies the condition `f(v) = v`.

6. Sum up the results: After filling the DP table, the sum of `dp[1][j]` for all `j` gives the total number of good vertices in all good trees.

7. Modulo operation: Since the result can be large, take the sum modulo `998244353`.

8. Edge Cases: Consider edge cases such as:
   a. Minimum input size `N = 2`.
   b. All nodes having zero out-degree except the root.
   c. Maximum input size `N = 500`.

9. Implementation: Implement the plan using a top-down approach with memoization to optimize the recursive calculations.
