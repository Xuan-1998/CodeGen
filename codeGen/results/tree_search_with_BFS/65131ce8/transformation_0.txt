1. State Definition: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of ways to form a subtree with i nodes and j good vertices. The root of this subtree is considered as a good vertex if it is the smallest vertex in its subtree.
2. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1 because a single node tree with one node is trivially a good vertex.
3. State Transition: For each node, consider the contribution of its subtrees:
   a. Iterate over all possible sizes of the left subtree.
   b. Calculate the number of good vertices in the left subtree and the right subtree.
   c. Use combinatorial methods to distribute the remaining nodes and good vertices.
4. Recurrence Relation: dp[i][j] can be calculated by summing over all possible distributions of nodes and good vertices among the subtrees rooted at the children of the current node.
5. Top-down approach with memoization: Use recursion to define the state transitions and store intermediate results in a memoization table to avoid redundant computations.
6. Edge Cases: Ensure that the constraints 2 ≤ N ≤ 500 and 0 ≤ d_i ≤ N-1 are properly handled. Also, handle the case where d_1 ≥ 1 and the sum of d_i equals N-1.
