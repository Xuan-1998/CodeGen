1. Define the problem in terms of Dynamic Programming (DP): We need to count the number of ways to form a tree with a given number of nodes and out-degrees such that the sum of the numbers of good vertices is maximized.
2. Initialize the DP table: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of ways to form a tree with i nodes and j good vertices. Initialize the DP table with appropriate base values.
3. Transition Relationship: For each node i, iterate over all possible numbers of nodes and good vertices in its subtrees. Use these to update dp[i][j] by considering how the subtrees combine to form the larger tree. Specifically, for each subtree configuration, calculate the new number of good vertices and update the DP table.
4. Iterate through all nodes: For each node, calculate the number of ways to form a tree with the given out-degrees and update the DP table accordingly.
5. Calculate the result: Sum up the number of good vertices for all configurations in the DP table to get the final answer. Return the result modulo 998244353.
6. Handle Edge Cases: Ensure that the plan accounts for edge cases such as minimum and maximum values of N, and cases where some d_i are zero.
