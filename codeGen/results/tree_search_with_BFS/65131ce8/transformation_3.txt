1. Define the problem in terms of Dynamic Programming (DP) where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to form a tree with i nodes and j good vertices.

2. Initialize the DP table:
   - dp[0][0] = 1, which means there is one way to form a tree with 0 nodes and 0 good vertices (the empty tree).

3. Iterate over the nodes from 1 to N. For each node i:
   - Iterate over the possible numbers of nodes k in the subtree rooted at node i.
   - Iterate over the possible numbers of good vertices g in the subtree rooted at node i.
   - Update the DP table by considering the contributions of subtrees rooted at various nodes and how they combine to form larger trees.

4. Use the given out-degree sequence d to ensure that the tree structure adheres to the constraints. Specifically, ensure that the sum of out-degrees equals N-1 and that the out-degree of each node matches the given sequence.

5. For each possible subtree size and number of good vertices, update the DP table by adding the number of ways to form the subtree to the current state.

6. After processing all nodes, the final answer will be the sum of dp[N][j] for all j, modulo 998244353, which gives the total number of good vertices for all good trees.

7. Handle edge cases:
   - Ensure that d[1] >= 1 as the root must have at least one child.
   - Handle cases where d[i] = 0 for leaf nodes.
   - Ensure the sum of d equals N-1.

8. Output the result after computing the sum of good vertices modulo 998244353.
