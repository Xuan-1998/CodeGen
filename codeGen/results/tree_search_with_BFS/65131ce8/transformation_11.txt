===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Understand the problem requirements and constraints: We need to find the sum of the numbers of good vertices for all good trees satisfying the given out-degree sequence.

2. Define what constitutes a good vertex: A vertex v is good if f(v) = v, where f(v) is the minimum vertex number in the subtree rooted at v.

3. Use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve the problem: Define dp[i][j] as the number of ways to form a subtree with i vertices and j good vertices.

4. Initialize the base cases:
   - dp[1][1] = 1 (a single node is trivially a good vertex)
   - dp[1][0] = 0 (it's impossible to have a tree with one node and zero good vertices)

5. Use a transition relationship to fill the DP table:
   - To compute dp[i][j], consider adding a new vertex to an existing subtree.
   - For each k (0 <= k <= i-1), dp[i][j] can be obtained by:
     - Adding the new vertex as a good vertex: dp[i][j] += dp[k][j-1] * C(i-1, k)
     - Adding the new vertex as a non-good vertex: dp[i][j] += dp[k][j] * C(i-1, k)
   - Here, C(i-1, k) is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose k vertices from i-1 vertices.

6. Compute the binomial coefficients using a precomputed table to avoid recomputation.

7. Sum up the numbers of good vertices for all possible trees.

8. Return the result modulo 998244353.

9. Handle edge cases: Ensure the plan works for the smallest and largest values of N, and for sequences with minimum and maximum out-degrees.
