1. Parse the input to get the number of vertices N and the list d of out-degrees.
2. Initialize a memoization table dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to form a subtree with i nodes and j good vertices.
3. Set base cases:
   - dp[1][1] = 1 (a single node is trivially a good vertex).
   - dp[1][0] = 0 (a single node tree cannot have zero good vertices).
4. Iterate through the number of nodes from 2 to N:
   - For each number of nodes i, iterate through the number of good vertices from 1 to i:
     - For each possible root degree k (from 0 to d[i-1]):
       - Compute the number of ways to distribute the remaining nodes and good vertices among the children of the current node.
5. Sum the number of good vertices for all valid trees and take the result modulo 998244353.
6. Print the result.
