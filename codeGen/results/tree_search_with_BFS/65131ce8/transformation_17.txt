1. Define the Problem: We need to count the number of good vertices in all good trees formed by the given out-degree sequence `d` of length `N`, modulo 998244353. 

2. Understand the Constraints: 
   - N is between 2 and 500.
   - Each `d_i` is between 0 and N-1.
   - The sum of all `d_i` is N-1.
   - The first element `d_1` is at least 1.

3. Dynamic Programming Approach:
   - Define `dp[i][j]` as the number of ways to form a good tree with `i` vertices and `j` good vertices.
   - Base Case: `dp[1][1] = 1`, since a single vertex tree with vertex 1 as the root is trivially a good tree with one good vertex.
   - Transition:
     - For each vertex count `i` (from 2 to N), and for each possible count of good vertices `j` (from 1 to i), compute `dp[i][j]` by considering how adding a new vertex affects the number of good vertices.
     - This involves summing over all possible ways to distribute the out-degrees among the subtrees rooted at the children of the root, ensuring the out-degree constraints are satisfied.

4. Implementation:
   - Initialize a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(N+1) x (N+1)` filled with zeros.
   - Set `dp[1][1] = 1`.
   - Iterate over the number of vertices `i` from 2 to N.
   - For each `i`, iterate over the number of good vertices `j` from 1 to i.
   - Update `dp[i][j]` based on the transition relationship by considering the addition of new vertices and their impact on the count of good vertices.
   - The final answer is the sum of `dp[N][j]` for all `j` from 1 to N, modulo 998244353.

5. Edge Cases:
   - Ensure the constraints are respected, especially the sum of `d` and the non-zero first element.
   - Handle the smallest case where `N=2`.

6. Output:
   - Print the final computed result.
