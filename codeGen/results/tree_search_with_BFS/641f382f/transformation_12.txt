Your plan is mostly correct, but there are a few issues. The main issue is that replacing the two adjacent elements with their greatest common divisor (gcd) doesn't necessarily lead to 1, even if the gcd is 1. For example, consider the array [2, 3]. The gcd of 2 and 3 is 1, but replacing either 2 or 3 with 1 would not make all elements in the array equal to 1. 

Another issue is that the plan doesn't consider the case where it's impossible to make all elements in the array equal to 1. For example, if the array is [2, 3, 4], there's no way to make all elements equal to 1, as the gcd of any two elements is always greater than 1. 

Here's an updated plan:

1. If there is a 1 in the array, return n - the count of 1's in the array. This is because we can always reduce any other number to 1 by performing an operation with 1.

2. If there isn't a 1 in the array, find the smallest gcd of any two elements in the array. This can be done by iterating over all pairs of elements in the array and updating the smallest gcd found so far. If the smallest gcd is not 1, return -1, as it's impossible to make all elements equal to 1.

3. If the smallest gcd is 1, return n - 1. This is because we can make all elements equal to 1 by performing n - 1 operations. Each operation involves selecting a pair of elements with gcd 1 and replacing one of them with 1.

This plan is more efficient than the original plan, as it doesn't require dynamic programming or a 2D array. It's also easier to implement. This plan covers all edge cases, as it handles arrays with or without 1's and arrays where it's impossible to make all elements equal to 1.
