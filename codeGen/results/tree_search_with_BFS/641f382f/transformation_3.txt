The plan is mostly correct, but there are a few points that need to be clarified or corrected:

1. Your state expression is not completely correct. dp[i][j] should represent the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array from index i to j inclusive to have a greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1, not necessarily to make all elements equal to 1.

2. The transition function is slightly incorrect. The GCD of the array from index i to j is not always 1, so we can't directly set dp[i][j] to j - i + 1. We need to iterate over all possible partitions of the array from i to j, calculate the GCD of each partition, and update dp[i][j] accordingly.

3. The memoization part is mostly correct, but we need to clarify how to calculate the GCD of the array from i to j. A simple way is to maintain a 2D array g where g[i][j] stores the GCD of the array from i to j. We can precompute this array in O(n^2) time using the formula g[i][j] = gcd(g[i][j-1], a[j]).

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize a 2D array dp with size n x n and fill it with a large number, and a 2D array g with size n x n and fill it with the corresponding GCD values. The state dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array from index i to j inclusive to have a GCD of 1.

2. Precompute the array g in O(n^2) time using the formula g[i][j] = gcd(g[i][j-1], a[j]).

3. Define a recursive function that takes two indices i and j, and returns the minimum number of operations required to make all elements from i to j have a GCD of 1. In this function, first check if the value of dp[i][j] is already computed. If so, return it. Otherwise, iterate over all indices k from i to j, and update dp[i][j] by taking the minimum between its current value and the sum of the function calls for the ranges (i, k) and (k+1, j), plus 1 if g[i][k] > 1 or g[k+1][j] > 1. If g[i][j] is 1, set dp[i][j] to 0.

4. Finally, call this function with the range (0, n-1) and return the result. If the result is the initial large number, return -1 because it's not possible to make all elements have a GCD of 1.
===END PLAN===
