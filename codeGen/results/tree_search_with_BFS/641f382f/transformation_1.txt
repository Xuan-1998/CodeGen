The plan is a good start, but there are a few issues. The main problem is that the operation defined in the problem statement doesn't guarantee that the array will eventually become an array of 1s. The operation can only replace two adjacent elements with their greatest common divisor (gcd), but if the gcd of any two adjacent elements is not 1, the operation will not make them become 1. 

Therefore, the first thing we need to check is whether the array contains at least one 1. If it doesn't, we should return -1 directly because it's impossible to make all elements become 1. 

If the array does contain 1, we can use a different approach. The key observation here is that, since we have at least one 1, we can always make the entire array become 1 by repeatedly applying the operation to each pair of adjacent elements that includes the 1. The number of operations required is just the distance from each element to the nearest 1.

So the updated plan is as follows:

1. Check whether the array contains at least one 1. If it doesn't, return -1 directly.
2. If the array contains 1, calculate the distance from each element to the nearest 1. The minimum number of operations required is the sum of these distances.
3. To calculate the distances efficiently, we can use a two-pass method: first pass from left to right and update the distance for each element by comparing it with the distance of its previous element plus 1; then pass from right to left and do the same thing. The distance for each element is the minimum distance calculated in these two passes.
4. To handle the case where the array contains multiple 1s, we need to initialize the distance for each 1 as 0 and the distance for other elements as a large number (e.g., the length of the array).
5. The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the array.
