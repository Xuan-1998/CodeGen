Your plan is a good start, but it seems to have a few issues. 

The main problem is with the transition step. You are trying to find the minimum operations to make all elements equal to 1, but the cost[i][j] you defined is the greatest common divisor of cost[i][k] and cost[k+1][j] which is not necessarily 1. 

Also, your plan does not consider the case where it's impossible to make all elements equal to 1. If the array does not contain 1, it's impossible to make all elements equal to 1 by replacing two adjacent elements with their greatest common divisor.

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Check if the array contains 1. If it does, return the number of elements in the array minus the number of 1s. This is because we can always make an operation to replace any number with 1 if there is a 1 adjacent to it. 
2. If the array does not contain 1, we need to find the minimum number of operations to make the greatest common divisor of some subarray equal to 1. For each pair of elements, calculate the greatest common divisor of the subarray from the first element to the second element. If the greatest common divisor is 1, update the minimum operations with the difference between the indices of the two elements.
3. If the minimum operations is still the initial value after checking all pairs of elements, return -1 because it's impossible to make all elements equal to 1. Otherwise, return the minimum operations plus the number of elements in the array minus 1. This is because we need one operation to replace a number with 1 for each element except for one.
===END PLAN===
