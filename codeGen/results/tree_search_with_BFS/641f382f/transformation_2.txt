The plan seems to be on the right track, but there are some potential issues and areas of improvement. 

The main issue with the current plan is that it does not correctly handle the calculation of the greatest common divisor (gcd). The plan states that for each pair of elements (i, j), compute their gcd and if it's 1, set dp[i][j] to j - i + 1. However, the gcd should be computed for the entire subarray from i to j, not just for the pair of elements at the ends of the subarray. 

Another issue is that the plan does not mention how to handle the case when it's not possible to make all elements of the array equal to 1. 

Here is an updated version of the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-down approach with memoization: This strategy involves starting from the original problem and breaking it down into subproblems. The results of these subproblems are stored for future reference to avoid redundant computation. This approach is more intuitive and easier to implement.
2. The state expression: dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array from index i to j inclusive equal to 1. Each dp[i][j] is calculated from the minimum of dp[i+1][j] and dp[i][j-1], plus the cost of the operation to replace the current element with its greatest common divisor.
3. Transition: dp[i][j] is calculated from the minimum of dp[i+1][j] and dp[i][j-1], plus the cost of the operation to replace the current element with its greatest common divisor. If the greatest common divisor of the array from index i to j is 1, then dp[i][j] is also the minimum of its current value and j - i + 1.
4. Tabulation: Start by initializing a 2D array dp with size n x n. For each subarray in the array, compute the greatest common divisor. For each subarray from i to j, if their gcd is 1, set dp[i][j] to j - i + 1. Then iterate over the array from the end to the beginning, and for each subarray from i to j, update dp[i][j] by taking the minimum between its current value and dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j], where k is any index between i and j. If there is no subarray whose gcd is 1, return -1. Otherwise, return the minimum value in dp[0].
