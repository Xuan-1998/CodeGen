The plan you've come up with is a good start, but there are a few areas that need to be addressed and corrected. Here's an updated version of the plan:

===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===

1. Dynamic Programming Approach: This problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems and use the solutions of these subproblems to solve the original problem. 

2. Base Case: For each index 'i', dp[i][i] = 0. This is because when the subarray only contains one element, it doesn't need any operation to make it equal to 1.

3. Transition: The transition function should be defined as follows: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + cost[i][j]), where cost[i][j] is the cost of making all elements from i to j equal to 1. This cost can be computed by checking if there's any element in the subarray [i, j] that is 1. If there is, cost[i][j] = 0, otherwise, cost[i][j] = 1.

4. Memoization: This involves solving the problem 'top-down'. Start by initializing a memo table with some default value (like infinity). Then, for each subarray from i to j, if the value in the memo table is not the default value, return it. Otherwise, calculate the minimum number of operations required to make all elements equal to 1, and store this value in the memo table.

5. Edge Case: If there's no 1 in the array, check if there's any pair of adjacent elements whose greatest common divisor is 1. If there is, the minimum number of operations required is n. If there isn't, print -1.
