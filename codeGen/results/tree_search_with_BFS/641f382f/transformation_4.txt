Your plan seems to be on the right track, but there are some issues that need to be addressed. 

Firstly, the problem statement doesn't guarantee that all elements in the array can be reduced to 1, even after all possible operations. So, we need to handle the case where it is impossible to make all elements 1. 

Secondly, the operation defined in the problem is to replace two adjacent elements with their greatest common divisor (GCD). This means that the operation can only be applied to adjacent elements, and the order of operations matters. Therefore, a dynamic programming approach that only considers subarrays may not work, as it does not take into account the order of operations. 

Thirdly, the problem asks for the minimum number of operations, not just whether it is possible to reduce all elements to 1. So, the dynamic programming state should keep track of the minimum number of operations required to reach a certain state.

Here is a revised plan:

1. Check if the array already contains a 1. If it does, return n-1 (where n is the length of the array), because we can replace all other elements with 1 in n-1 operations.

2. If the array does not contain a 1, use dynamic programming to find the minimum number of operations to make all elements 1.

3. Define the state dp[i][j] as the minimum number of operations to make all elements from i to j in the array equal to 1. Initialize dp[i][i] = 0 for all i.

4. For each pair of elements (i, j) in the array, calculate their GCD. If the GCD is 1, update dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + 1) for all k in range(i, j), where dp[i][k] and dp[k+1][j] are the minimum number of operations to make all elements from i to k and from k+1 to j equal to 1, respectively.

5. If no pair of elements has a GCD of 1, return -1, because it is impossible to make all elements 1.

6. Otherwise, return the minimum value in dp[i][j] for all i and j.

This plan should cover all possible cases and correctly calculate the minimum number of operations to make all elements 1, if it is possible. However, this plan has a time complexity of O(n^3), which may be too slow for large input sizes. A potential improvement could be to use a faster algorithm to calculate the GCD of all pairs of elements.
