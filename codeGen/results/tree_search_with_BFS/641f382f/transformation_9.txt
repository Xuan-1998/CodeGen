Your plan seems to be on the right track, but it may have some potential issues. The main problem is that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers can be more than 1. In such cases, the operations will not make these two numbers equal to 1. Also, it is not clear how you plan to use the GCD in the state transition. Do you plan to replace the two numbers with their GCD and then continue with the remaining elements? This might not always lead to the optimal solution.

Here is an updated version of the plan:
===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Start by checking if the array contains any 1. If it does, then the minimum number of operations required to make all elements 1 is n - the number of 1s in the array.
2. If the array does not contain any 1, then we need to find pairs of elements whose GCD is 1. For each pair (i, j), compute the GCD of elements from index i to j. If the GCD is 1, then the minimum number of operations required to make all elements 1 is j - i + n - 1. Keep track of the minimum number of operations across all pairs.
3. If no pair of elements has a GCD of 1, then it is not possible to make all elements 1, so return -1.
===END PLAN===

This plan is based on the observation that if the GCD of any pair of elements in the array is 1, then it is possible to make all elements 1 by performing operations on this pair and then replacing the rest of the elements with 1. The number of operations required is the distance between the pair plus the number of elements not in the pair. If no such pair exists, then it is not possible to make all elements 1. The plan should handle all edge cases as it considers all pairs of elements in the array.
