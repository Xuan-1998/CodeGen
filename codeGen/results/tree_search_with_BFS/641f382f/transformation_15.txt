Your plan seems to be on the right track, but it's a bit too complicated and doesn't correctly handle the case where there's no 1 in the array. Here's a revised version:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. First, check if there's a 1 in the array. If there is, return n-1 because we can make all other elements equal to 1 in n-1 operations.
2. If there's no 1 in the array, initialize a 2D array dp of size n x n with infinity.
3. Then, fill the dp array using a bottom-up approach. For each subarray from i to j (with i <= j), compute the gcd of the subarray. If the gcd is 1, then dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], j-i). Otherwise, dp[i][j] = infinity.
4. Finally, find the minimum value in the dp array. If the minimum value is still infinity, return -1 because it's impossible to make all elements equal to 1. Otherwise, return the minimum value + n.
===END PLAN===

This plan is simpler and correctly handles all cases. The time complexity is O(n^3), which is acceptable given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000). The space complexity is O(n^2), which is also acceptable.
