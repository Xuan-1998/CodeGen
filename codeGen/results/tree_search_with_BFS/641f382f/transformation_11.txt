The plan appears to be on the right track in terms of using dynamic programming to solve the problem. However, it may be overly complex and could be simplified. Here is an updated version of the plan.

===UPDATED PLAN===

1. Create a helper function to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers.

2. Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `n x n` where `dp[i][j]` represents the gcd of the elements from index `i` to `j`.

3. Fill the `dp` array by iterating over the input array. For each pair of indices `(i, j)`, calculate the gcd of the elements at these indices and store it in `dp[i][j]`.

4. If there is a 1 in the input array, the minimum number of operations is `n - 1` (because we can always replace other numbers with 1). If there is no 1 in the input array, calculate the minimum number of operations as follows:

    1. Initialize a variable `minOps` to a large value.
    
    2. For each pair of indices `(i, j)`, if `dp[i][j]` is 1, set `minOps` to the minimum of `minOps` and `j - i`.
    
    3. If `minOps` is still a large value (i.e., it was not updated), return -1. Otherwise, return `minOps + n - 1`.

This plan simplifies the original one by removing the need for a `cost` function and the complex state transition. It uses the fact that if there is a 1 in the array, we can always make all elements equal to 1 with `n - 1` operations. If there is no 1, we need to find a subarray whose gcd is 1 and replace the elements outside this subarray with 1, which requires `minOps + n - 1` operations. This plan should handle all edge cases as it considers all possible subarrays.
