Your plan seems to be on the right track, but there are a few points that need to be clarified and possibly adjusted. 

Here is an updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State Expression: dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of operations required to make all elements from index i to j equal to 1. The state transition will be based on the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the elements at index i and j.
2. State: dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make all elements from index i to j equal to 1.
3. Initialization: Initialize a 2D array dp of size n x n with a large value (for example, INT_MAX). If there is a 1 in the array, set the corresponding dp[i][i] = 0, because no operation is needed to make 1 equal to 1. 
4. Tabulation: For each subarray of size 2 to n, compute the minimum number of operations required to make all elements equal to 1 and update the dp table accordingly. This can be done by iterating over all possible lengths (from 2 to n) and for each length, iterate over all possible starting points. For each subarray, compute the gcd and if it is 1, update dp[i][j] with the minimum between the current value and the length of the subarray minus 1 (which is the number of operations required to make all elements equal to 1).
5. Compute the minimum operations: Finally, iterate over the dp table to find the minimum number of operations required to make all elements equal to 1. If the minimum value is still the initial large value, it means it is not possible to make all elements equal to 1, so return -1. Otherwise, return the minimum value plus the number of 1s in the array minus 1 (because each operation can reduce two 1s to one 1).
===END PLAN===

This plan should cover all edge cases, including the case where it is not possible to make all elements equal to 1. The time complexity of the plan is O(n^3), which is acceptable considering the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000. The space complexity is O(n^2), which is also acceptable under the same constraint.
