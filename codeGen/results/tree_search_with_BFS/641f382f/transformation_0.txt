I believe your plan is on the right track, but it seems to have a significant issue. The problem is that replacing a number with the GCD of it and its neighbor doesn't necessarily reduce the number to 1, and the order of operations can matter. For example, consider the array [4, 2, 3]. If we first replace 4 with the GCD of 4 and 2, we get [2, 2, 3]. Then, replacing either 2 with the GCD of 2 and 2 or 2 and 3 doesn't help us reach our goal of all 1s. However, if we first replace 2 with the GCD of 2 and 3, we get [4, 1, 3], and then we can replace 4 and 1 to get [1, 1, 3], and finally replace 1 and 3 to get [1, 1, 1].

So, we need a different approach. Here's an updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. First, check if there's a 1 in the array. If there is, then we can replace all other numbers with 1 in n-1 operations, where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the GCD of any number and 1 is 1, so we can always replace a number with 1 if 1 is adjacent to it.
2. If there's no 1 in the array, then we need to find two numbers whose GCD is 1. We can do this by iterating over all pairs of numbers in the array and calculating their GCD. If we find a pair whose GCD is 1, then we can replace all other numbers with 1 in n-1 operations, plus the distance between the two numbers in the pair. This is because we can first replace the two numbers in the pair with 1, and then replace all other numbers with 1.
3. If we can't find a pair whose GCD is 1, then it's impossible to make all numbers in the array equal to 1, so we return -1.
===END PLAN===

This plan works because if there's a 1 in the array or a pair of numbers whose GCD is 1, then we can make all numbers in the array equal to 1. Otherwise, it's impossible. This plan also takes into account the order of operations, which can affect the minimum number of operations.
