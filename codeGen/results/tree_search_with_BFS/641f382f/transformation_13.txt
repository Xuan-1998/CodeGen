Your plan seems to be on the right track, but there are some issues and missing parts. Here's an updated version of the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State Definition: Define a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements from index i to j inclusive equal to 1.
2. Base Case: If there is any element in the array which is already 1, then the answer is n-1 (as we can convert every other element to 1 in a single operation). So, initially check if there is any 1 in the array. If yes, print n-1 and return. If no 1 is found, continue to the next steps.
3. Initialization: Initialize a 2D array dp with size n x n and fill it with a large value (like INT_MAX). dp[i][i] will be 0 for all i, as a single element cannot be further broken down.
4. Recursion: For each subarray from size 2 to n, compute dp[i][j] using the formula dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + 1) for all k between i and j-1. The "+1" is for the operation of replacing two adjacent elements with their gcd. 
5. GCD Calculation: For each subarray, calculate the gcd of all elements in the subarray. If the gcd is 1, then dp[i][j] can be updated to min(dp[i][j], j-i). This is because if the gcd of any subarray is 1, we can make all elements of this subarray 1 in j-i operations.
6. Answer: The final answer will be dp[0][n-1] if dp[0][n-1] != INT_MAX, else print -1 indicating it's not possible to make all elements equal to 1.
===END PLAN===

This plan is more detailed and covers edge cases. It also correctly uses dynamic programming to find the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements of the array equal to 1. It uses the concept of gcd to check if it's possible to make all elements of a subarray equal to 1.
