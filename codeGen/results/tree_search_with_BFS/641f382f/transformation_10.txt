Your plan seems to be on the right track. However, there are a few points that need to be addressed:

1. The cost function: It's not very clear how you're calculating the cost of making all elements from index i to j equal to 1 based on the greatest common divisor of the elements at index i and j. The cost should be 0 if the gcd is 1 and infinity otherwise.

2. The initialization of dp[i][i]: The dp[i][i] should be set to 0 only if the element at index i is 1. Otherwise, it should be set to infinity since we cannot make a number other than 1 equal to 1 with no operations.

3. The initialization of dp[i][j]: The dp[i][j] should be set to 1 if the gcd of the elements at index i and j is 1. Otherwise, it should be set to infinity. But this initialization should be done only for j = i + 1, not for all pairs of elements.

4. The final answer: The final answer will be dp[0][n-1] if it is not infinity, else -1. But if there is any 1 in the array, we can always make all elements equal to 1 by choosing the 1 and its adjacent element in each operation. So the minimum number of operations will be n - 1 minus the number of 1's in the array. Therefore, we should also keep track of the number of 1's in the array and update the final answer accordingly.

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State Expression: dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of operations required to make all elements from index i to j equal to 1. The state transition will be based on the greatest common divisor of the elements at index i and j.
2. Transition: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + cost(i, j)) for all i <= k < j, where cost(i, j) is 0 if the greatest common divisor of the elements at index i and j is 1, and infinity otherwise.
3. Tabulation: Initialize a 2D array dp of size n x n with infinity. For each element in the array, set dp[i][i] to 0 if the element is 1, else set it to infinity. For each pair of adjacent elements in the array, set dp[i][j] to 1 if the greatest common divisor of the elements at index i and j is 1, else set it to infinity. For each length l from 3 to n, for each start index i from 0 to n-l, set the end index j to i+l-1, and for each partition index k from i to j-1, update dp[i][j] to the minimum of dp[i][j] and dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + cost(i, j). Also keep track of the number of 1's in the array. The final answer will be the minimum of dp[0][n-1] and n - 1 minus the number of 1's in the array, if it is not infinity, else -1.
===END PLAN===
