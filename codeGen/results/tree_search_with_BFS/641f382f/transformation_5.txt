The plan is mostly correct and well thought out. However, there are a few important points missing and some clarifications needed.

1. We need to add a check for the case where there is already a 1 in the array. If there is, the answer will be n - 1, because we can replace all other elements with 1 in n - 1 operations.

2. The state transition is not clearly defined. We need to specify how to transition from one state to another. The transition would be from dp[i][j] to dp[i][k] and dp[k+1][j] for all i <= k < j. The new state dp[i][j] would be the minimum of its old value and dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + 1, if the gcd of subarrays [i, k] and [k+1, j] is 1.

3. We need to initialize the dp table with a large value, such as INT_MAX, to ensure that the minimum operation count is correctly updated during the state transition.

4. We also need to calculate the gcd of all subarrays in advance to speed up the computation.

Here is the updated plan:

1. Check if there is already a 1 in the array. If there is, the answer will be n - 1, because we can replace all other elements with 1 in n - 1 operations. If not, proceed to the next step.

2. Pre-compute the gcd of all subarrays. This can be done in O(n^2) time.

3. Initialize a 2D dp table with size n x n, and fill it with a large value, such as INT_MAX. The dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations to make all elements from i to j in the array equal to 1.

4. Set the base case: dp[i][i] = 0 for all i, because when the subarray only contains one element, it doesn't need any operation to make it equal to 1.

5. For each length from 2 to n, and for each starting point i, compute dp[i][j] (j = i + length - 1) as the minimum of its old value and dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + 1 for all i <= k < j, if the gcd of subarrays [i, k] and [k+1, j] is 1.

6. If dp[0][n-1] is still a large value (e.g., INT_MAX), it means it's impossible to make all elements equal to 1. Return -1 in this case. Otherwise, return dp[0][n-1] as the minimum number of operations.
