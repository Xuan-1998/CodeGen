===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define the problem in terms of dynamic programming.
2. Define dp[i][j] as the number of valid matrices of size i x j.
3. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 2, since a 1x1 matrix can have either 0 or 1 and both trivially satisfy the condition.
4. Transition: For each i and j, derive dp[i][j] from dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1] by considering the addition of a new row or column.
5. Ensure the condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} holds for all quadruples (a, b, c, d) when adding a new row or column.
6. Iterate through all possible values of i and j to fill the dp table.
7. The final answer is dp[N][M] modulo 998244353.
8. Consider edge cases such as the smallest matrices (1xM and Nx1) and ensure they are handled correctly in the transitions.
