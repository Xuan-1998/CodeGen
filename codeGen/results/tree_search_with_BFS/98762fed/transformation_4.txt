===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming Approach: This approach involves breaking the problem into smaller subproblems, storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations. It uses a bottom-up DP table to store intermediate results. Time complexity: O(N*M), space complexity: O(N*M).

State Expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid matrices of size i x j. This state will store the count of valid matrices up to the i-th row and j-th column.

1. Initialization: Initialize dp[0][0] = 1 since a 0x0 matrix is trivially valid.

2. Transition Relationship: To compute dp[i][j], consider the possible values for the element at position (i, j). For each possible value (either 0 or 1), check the condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} for all valid (a, b, c, d) quadruples. Update dp[i][j] based on the valid matrices formed by this value. Combine results from smaller subproblems to form the final count for dp[i][j].

3. Iterate through all positions in the matrix from (1, 1) to (N, M) and apply the transition relationship to fill up the dp table.

4. The final answer will be the sum of all dp[i][j] values for 1 <= i <= N and 1 <= j <= M, modulo 998244353.

Edge Cases: Ensure that edge cases such as matrices with only one row or one column are handled correctly by the DP transitions.
