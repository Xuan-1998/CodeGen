Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This approach involves solving the problem by iteratively filling up a table based on the results of smaller subproblems. It avoids recursion and builds the solution in a tabular form.

State Expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid matrices of size i x j that satisfy the given condition.

Initialization: 
- dp[1][1] = 2 (since a 1x1 matrix can be either [0] or [1])

Transition Relationship: 
- To formulate the transition, consider how adding a row or a column affects the number of valid matrices. The value of dp[i][j] can be derived from dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1] by ensuring that the new row or column maintains the condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b}.
- Specifically, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] * dp[1][j] + dp[i][j-1] * dp[i][1] - dp[i-1][j-1] * dp[1][1] (to avoid double counting).

Final Computation:
- The result will be dp[N][M] modulo 998244353.

Edge Cases:
- Consider the smallest matrix sizes (N=1, M=1) and ensure that the base case is correctly handled.
- Consider larger values of N and M up to the constraint limits to ensure the solution scales properly.

Time Complexity: O(N*M)
