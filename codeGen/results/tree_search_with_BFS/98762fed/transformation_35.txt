===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State: Define dp[i][j] as the number of valid matrices of size i x j.
2. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 2, since a 1x1 matrix can have either 0 or 1, both trivially satisfying the condition.
3. Transition: To build dp[i][j], consider the number of ways to add a new row or column to the matrices of size (i-1)xj or ix(j-1) and ensure the condition A[a, b] * A[c, d] <= A[a, d] * A[c, b] is satisfied for all quadruples (a, b, c, d).
4. Iterate over all possible matrix sizes from 1x1 to NxM and use the transition relation to fill the dp table.
5. The answer will be dp[N][M] % 998244353.
6. Edge Cases: Consider minimum values of N and M (i.e., 1), and ensure the plan handles these cases correctly.
