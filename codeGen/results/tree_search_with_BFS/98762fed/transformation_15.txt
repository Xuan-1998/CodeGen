Top-down approach with memoization: This approach involves breaking the problem into smaller subproblems, storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations. It uses recursion and memoization to store intermediate results. 

1. Base Case: For the base case, dp[0][0] can be initialized to 1 because a 0x0 matrix trivially satisfies the condition.

2. Transition Relationship: To construct dp[i][j], consider the contribution of the (i, j) element. The transition can be defined using the previously computed states. Specifically, dp[i][j] can be derived from dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], and dp[i-1][j-1] by ensuring the condition A_{a, b} \\times A_{c, d} \\leq A_{a, d} \\times A_{c, b} is satisfied for all valid (a, b, c, d).

3. Memoization: Store the results of subproblems in a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of valid matrices considering the first i rows and j columns.

4. Edge Cases: Consider edge cases where N or M is 1. In such cases, the condition is trivially satisfied as there are no valid (a, b, c, d) quadruples.

5. Final Computation: Sum up the values in the dp array to get the total number of valid matrices and take the result modulo 998244353.

Time complexity: O(N*M), space complexity: O(N*M).
