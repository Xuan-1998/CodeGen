===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define a function `count_ones(N, M)` to calculate the number of valid matrices.
2. Initialize a 2D list `dp` of size (N+1) x (M+1) with all elements set to 0.
3. Base Case: Set dp[0][0] to 1 because a 0x0 matrix trivially satisfies the condition.
4. Use a nested loop to iterate over each cell (i, j) in the dp table:
   a. For each cell (i, j), calculate the number of valid matrices ending at that cell by considering all possible ways to extend smaller matrices.
   b. Use the condition A_{a, b} x A_{c, d} <= A_{a, d} x A_{c, b} to ensure the matrix formed is valid.
5. Use memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
6. After filling the dp table, the result will be stored in dp[N][M].
7. Return the result modulo 998244353.
8. Consider edge cases like N=1, M=1, and the smallest inputs.
