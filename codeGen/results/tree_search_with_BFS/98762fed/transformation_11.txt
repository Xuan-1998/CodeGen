===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Problem Understanding: We need to count the number of valid N x M matrices where each element is either 0 or 1, and the condition A[a, b] * A[c, d] <= A[a, d] * A[c, b] holds for all 1 <= a < c <= N and 1 <= b < d <= M.

2. Constraints and Observations:
    - For N, M up to 400, a brute-force approach is infeasible due to the large number of possible matrices.
    - The condition implies a kind of monotonicity or order in the matrix elements.

3. Dynamic Programming Approach:
    - Define dp[i][j] as the number of valid matrices of size i x j.
    - The base case is dp[0][0] = 1, representing an empty matrix.
    - For each cell (i, j), we need to consider the placement of 0 or 1 and ensure the condition holds.

4. Recursive State Transition:
    - For each cell (i, j), consider placing either 0 or 1.
    - Ensure that placing 1 in (i, j) does not violate the condition with respect to previously placed elements.
    - Use memoization to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

5. Implementation:
    - Initialize dp array with dimensions (N+1)x(M+1) to store the number of valid matrices for each subproblem.
    - Iterate through each cell and update the dp array based on the possible placements of 0 or 1.
    - Return dp[N][M] % 998244353 as the final result.

6. Edge Cases:
    - Smallest values of N and M (e.g., 1x1 matrix).
    - Ensure the solution handles the modulo operation correctly to avoid overflow.
