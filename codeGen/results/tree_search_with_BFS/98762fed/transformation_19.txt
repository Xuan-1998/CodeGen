1. **State Representation**: Let `dp[i][j]` represent the number of valid matrices of size `i x j` that satisfy the given condition.

2. **Base Case**:
   - `dp[1][1] = 2` because a 1x1 matrix can either be [0] or [1].

3. **Transition**:
   - For matrices larger than 1x1, we need to ensure the given condition holds for all quadruples `(a, b, c, d)` where `1 <= a < c <= N` and `1 <= b < d <= M`. 
   - This means that for each element `A[a][b]`, `A[c][d]`, `A[a][d]`, and `A[c][b]` in the matrix, the relation `A[a, b] * A[c, d] <= A[a, d] * A[c, b]` must hold.
   - We need to count all such matrices that satisfy this condition and ensure the transition from smaller sub-matrices to larger ones.

4. **Computation**:
   - Iterate through all possible matrix sizes from `1x1` to `NxM`.
   - For each size `i x j`, compute the number of valid matrices by ensuring the condition holds for the newly added row and column.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the number can be very large, take the result modulo `998244353` at each step to avoid overflow and ensure the result is within the required range.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle the smallest possible matrices (1x1).
   - Consider matrices where either N or M is 1, which simplifies the condition.

7. **Final Result**:
   - The final answer will be `dp[N][M]`, which gives the number of valid matrices of size `NxM`.

Time complexity: O(N*M)
