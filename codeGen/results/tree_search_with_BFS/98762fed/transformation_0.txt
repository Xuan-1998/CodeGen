===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem is about finding the number of valid matrices of size N x M where each element is either 0 or 1, and the matrices satisfy a specific condition. The plan involves using Dynamic Programming to solve the problem efficiently.

State Expression:
Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid matrices of size i x j. This state will store the count of valid matrices up to the i-th row and j-th column.

Steps:
1. Initialize a 2D array dp of size (N+1) x (M+1) with all elements set to 0.
2. Set dp[0][0] to 1, as there is one valid matrix of size 0x0.
3. Iterate over the rows from 1 to N and columns from 1 to M.
4. For each cell (i, j) in the dp array, calculate the number of valid matrices of size i x j by considering the matrices formed by adding a row or a column to the smaller valid matrices.
5. Use the given condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} to ensure the matrices are valid.
6. Sum up the valid matrices for each cell and update the dp array.
7. The result will be stored in dp[N][M], which gives the number of valid matrices of size N x M.

Edge Cases:
- When N or M is 1, the condition is trivially satisfied, so the number of valid matrices is 2^(N*M).
- When N and M are both 1, the result is 2.

Time Complexity: O(N*M)
Space Complexity: O(N*M)
