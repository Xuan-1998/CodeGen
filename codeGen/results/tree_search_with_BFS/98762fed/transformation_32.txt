Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This approach involves solving the problem by iteratively filling up a table based on the results of smaller subproblems. It avoids recursion and builds the solution in a tabular form. Time complexity: O(N*M), space complexity: O(N*M).

Base Case: dp[1][1] = 2, since a 1x1 matrix can have either 0 or 1, and both trivially satisfy the condition.

1. State: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid matrices of size i x j.
2. Transition: To compute dp[i][j], consider extending smaller matrices by adding a row or column and ensuring the condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} holds. Specifically, for each new cell added, ensure that it does not violate the condition with any previously existing cells.
3. Iterate over all possible sizes of submatrices from 1x1 to NxM, updating the dp table based on the valid extensions.
4. Use modulo 998244353 to keep the numbers manageable.

Edge Cases:
- When N or M is 1, the matrices are trivially valid as there are no quadruples (a, b, c, d) to consider.
- Large values of N and M (close to 400) should be handled efficiently within the constraints.

Final Output: The value of dp[N][M] will give the number of valid matrices of size N x M.
