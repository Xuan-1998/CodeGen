===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define the problem in terms of Dynamic Programming. Let dp[n][m] represent the number of valid matrices of size n x m.
2. Base Case: Initialize dp[0][0] to 1 because a 0x0 matrix trivially satisfies the condition.
3. Transition: For each cell (i, j) in the matrix, consider the possible values (0 or 1) and check the condition A_{a, b} × A_{c, d} ≤ A_{a, d} × A_{c, b} for all valid quadruples (a, b, c, d). Update dp[i][j] based on the values of dp for smaller subproblems.
4. Iterate: Fill up the dp table iteratively for all sizes of matrices from 1x1 to NxM.
5. Result: The final answer will be the value in dp[N][M] modulo 998244353.
6. Edge Cases: Consider the smallest values of N and M (both equal to 1) and the largest values of N and M (both equal to 400) to ensure the solution handles all edge cases.
