Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This approach involves solving the problem by iteratively filling up a table based on the results of smaller subproblems. It avoids recursion and builds the solution in a tabular form. Time complexity: O(N*M), space complexity: O(N*M).

1. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1, since a 1x1 matrix with a single element (either 0 or 1) trivially satisfies the condition.

2. State: Define dp[i][j] as the number of valid matrices of size i x j.

3. Transition: dp[i][j] can be derived from dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1] by adding a new row or column and checking the condition for all quadruples (a, b, c, d).

4. Iterate through all possible sizes of the matrix from 1x1 up to NxM, filling the dp table based on the transitions defined.

5. The final answer will be the sum of all dp[N][M] matrices, modulo 998244353.

6. Edge Cases: Handle the smallest case where N=1 and M=1 separately. Ensure that the modulo operation is applied at each step to avoid overflow.
