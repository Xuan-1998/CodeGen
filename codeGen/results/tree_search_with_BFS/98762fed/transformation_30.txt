===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define the state: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid matrices of size i x j.
2. Initialize the base case: dp[1][1] = 2, since a 1x1 matrix can either be [0] or [1], both of which trivially satisfy the condition.
3. Transition: To compute dp[i][j], consider extending smaller matrices by adding a row or column. For each new element added, ensure the condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} holds for all valid (a, b, c, d) quadruples.
4. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: Iteratively fill up the dp table based on the results of smaller subproblems.
5. Iterate over all possible matrix sizes from 1x1 to NxM. For each size, compute the number of valid matrices by ensuring the condition holds when extending from smaller matrices.
6. Use modulo 998244353 for all operations to avoid overflow and meet the problem's requirements.
7. The final answer will be stored in dp[N][M].

Time complexity: O(N*M), space complexity: O(N*M).
