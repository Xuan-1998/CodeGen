1. Problem Understanding: We need to count the number of 1s in all valid N x M matrices where each element is either 0 or 1, such that for any quadruple (a, b, c, d) with 1 ≤ a < c ≤ N and 1 ≤ b < d ≤ M, the condition A[a][b] * A[c][d] ≤ A[a][d] * A[c][b] holds.

2. Insight: The condition A[a][b] * A[c][d] ≤ A[a][d] * A[c][b] implies that if A[a][b] and A[c][d] are both 1, then A[a][d] and A[c][b] must also be 1. This suggests a pattern where the matrix has a specific structure.

3. Matrix Structure: A valid matrix must have all 1s in the top-left corner forming a rectangle. This is because any 1 outside this rectangle would violate the condition.

4. Counting Valid Matrices:
   - Define dp[i][j] as the number of valid matrices of size i x j.
   - Initialize dp[0][0] = 1 because a 0x0 matrix trivially satisfies the condition.
   - For each cell (i, j), calculate the number of valid matrices by considering all submatrices ending at (i, j).

5. Dynamic Programming Transition:
   - For each cell (i, j), if we place a 1 at (i, j), we need to ensure that a valid rectangle of 1s is maintained.
   - Thus, dp[i][j] can be derived from dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], and dp[i-1][j-1] while ensuring the condition holds.

6. Edge Cases: Consider matrices of minimum size (1x1) and maximum size (400x400).

7. Final Calculation: Sum up all dp[i][j] values to get the total number of valid matrices and then count the number of 1s in these matrices.

8. Modulo Operation: Since the result needs to be modulo 998244353, ensure all calculations are done modulo 998244353.

Steps:
1. Initialize a 2D dp array of size (N+1) x (M+1) with all zeros.
2. Set dp[0][0] = 1.
3. Iterate over each cell (i, j) and update dp[i][j] based on the previous states.
4. Sum up all dp values to get the total number of valid matrices.
5. Count the number of 1s in these matrices.
6. Print the result modulo 998244353.
