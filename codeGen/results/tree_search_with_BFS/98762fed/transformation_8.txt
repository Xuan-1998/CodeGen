===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define the problem using Dynamic Programming (DP) to count valid matrices.
2. Define the state expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid matrices of size i x j.
3. Initialize the base cases:
   - dp[0][j] = 1 for all 0 <= j <= M, as a matrix with zero rows is trivially valid.
   - dp[i][0] = 1 for all 0 <= i <= N, as a matrix with zero columns is trivially valid.
4. Transition: For each cell (i, j) in the matrix:
   - Calculate dp[i][j] by considering the possible values of the current cell and ensuring the condition A_{a, b} * A_{c, d} <= A_{a, d} * A_{c, b} holds for all quadruples (a, b, c, d).
   - Use the results of smaller subproblems (previous rows and columns) to build up the solution for larger matrices.
5. Ensure the results are computed modulo 998244353 to avoid overflow and meet problem requirements.
6. Iterate through all possible matrix sizes from 1x1 up to NxM, using the DP table to compute the number of valid matrices.
7. Output the final result, which is the value of dp[N][M].
