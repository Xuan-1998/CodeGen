Top-down approach with memoization: This approach involves breaking the problem into smaller subproblems, storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations. It uses recursion and memoization to store intermediate results. Time complexity: O(N*M), space complexity: O(N*M).

State Expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid matrices of size i x j. This state will store the count of valid matrices up to the i-th row and j-th column.

Base Case: Initialize dp[0][j] = 1 and dp[i][0] = 1 for all valid i and j, as a matrix with zero rows or zero columns is trivially valid.

Transition: We need to ensure that for every quadruple (a, b, c, d) such that 1 ≤ a < c ≤ i and 1 ≤ b < d ≤ j, the condition A_{a, b} * A_{c, d} ≤ A_{a, d} * A_{c, b} holds. This can be achieved by considering the valid states from the previous row and column and ensuring the condition holds when adding a new row or column.

Edge Cases: Consider edge cases where N = 1 or M = 1, as these represent matrices with only one row or one column, which are trivially valid.

Final Computation: Sum up all valid configurations stored in dp[N][M] and take the result modulo 998244353.
