Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This approach involves solving the problem by iteratively filling up a table based on the results of smaller subproblems. It avoids recursion and builds the solution in a tabular form. Time complexity: O(N*M), space complexity: O(N*M).
1. State: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid matrices of size i x j. Transition: To compute dp[i][j], consider extending smaller matrices by adding a row or column and ensuring the condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} holds.
2. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 2, since a 1x1 matrix with a single element (either 0 or 1) trivially satisfies the condition.
3. Transition: For each cell dp[i][j], calculate the number of valid matrices by considering adding a row or column to the smaller subproblems dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1] while ensuring the condition holds.
4. Iterate through all possible matrix sizes from 1x1 to NxM and fill the dp table accordingly.
5. Sum up the valid matrices and return the result modulo 998244353.
