===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem requires counting the number of valid matrices under certain conditions. Here is a detailed plan to solve the problem using Dynamic Programming:

1. Define the DP state:
   - Let `dp[i][j]` represent the number of valid matrices of size `i x j`.

2. Initialize the DP table:
   - `dp[0][0] = 1` since a 0x0 matrix is trivially valid.
   - Initialize other necessary base cases as needed.

3. Fill the DP table iteratively:
   - Loop through each possible matrix size `(i, j)` from `(1, 1)` to `(N, M)`.
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, determine the number of valid matrices by considering the subproblems and ensuring the given condition `A[a, b] * A[c, d] <= A[a, d] * A[c, b]` holds for all valid `(a, b, c, d)`.

4. Use the conditions to update the DP table:
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, ensure the condition is met by considering valid configurations of previous cells.
   - Update `dp[i][j]` based on the number of valid configurations that can be extended to form a valid matrix of size `i x j`.

5. Compute the result:
   - The result will be the value in `dp[N][M]` modulo `998244353`.

6. Edge cases:
   - Handle small values of `N` and `M` explicitly.
   - Ensure the DP table is correctly initialized to avoid index errors.

Time complexity: O(N*M)
Space complexity: O(N*M)
