Your plan seems correct and it is a good start. However, there are a few things that need to be considered and clarified.

1. You mentioned that you will initialize all dp[i] with -2. But it is not clear how you will handle the case when the program does not terminate. You need to devise a way to detect cycles in the sequence to determine when the program does not terminate.

2. Also, you need to define how you will transition from one state to another. You mentioned that you will calculate dp[i] using previously calculated states, but it is not clear how you will do this.

Here is an updated plan considering the above points:

===BEGIN PLAN===

1. State: dp[i] represents the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}.

2. Base Case: dp[1] = 0, because initially y = 0. If the program does not terminate, dp[i] = -1.

3. Initialize a dp array of size n+1 with all elements as -2. This array will be used for memoization. dp[i] = -2 means the value of y has not been calculated yet when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}.

4. Initialize another array, visited[] of size n+1 with all elements set to false. This array will be used to detect cycles. If visited[i] is true, it means we have visited the state i before.

5. For each i from 2 to n, perform the following steps:

   a. If dp[i] is not -2, continue to the next i because we have already calculated the final value of y for this state.

   b. Set visited[i] to true because we are visiting this state now.

   c. Calculate the new state x and y after performing the operations. x will be x + a[x] and y will be y + a[x].

   d. If x <= 0 or x > n, dp[i] = y because the program terminates.

   e. If visited[x] is true, dp[i] = -1 because we have detected a cycle and the program does not terminate.

   f. Otherwise, recursively calculate dp[x] and set dp[i] = dp[x] + y.

6. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This approach starts from the most basic state and iteratively calculates the answer for each state. Once we have calculated the answer for a state, we use this to compute the answer for other states. This approach is usually more efficient and requires less function call overheads, but it may require more thinking to determine the order of states.
