The plan is mostly correct, but there are some issues that need to be addressed.

First, the state dp[i] is not clearly defined. It seems that it should represent the final value of y when the program starts at position i, not when the sequence starts at i.

Second, the tabulation process is not entirely correct. The problem is that you cannot simply check dp[i+a[i]] to decide whether the program terminates or not. This is because the program can enter a loop that does not include the starting position. In other words, even if dp[i+a[i]] is not -1, the program can still fail to terminate.

To fix these issues, we can use depth-first search (DFS) to simulate the program and detect loops. Specifically, we can keep track of the nodes that we have visited during the current DFS. If we encounter a node that we have visited before, it means that the program enters a loop.

Here is the updated plan:

1. Define dp[i] as the final value of y when the program starts at position i. If the program does not terminate, dp[i] is -1.

2. Initialize all elements in dp to -2, which represents that we have not computed the result for the corresponding position.

3. For each i from 1 to n, perform DFS starting from i. During the DFS:
   - If we visit a position j such that dp[j] is not -2, return dp[j].
   - If we visit a position j that we have visited during the current DFS, return -1 to represent that the program does not terminate.
   - Otherwise, mark j as visited and recursively visit j + a[j] and j - a[j]. If any recursive call returns -1, return -1. Otherwise, return the sum of a[j] and the results of the recursive calls.

4. After the DFS, dp[i] is the final value of y when the program starts at position i. If the program does not terminate, dp[i] is -1.

5. Print dp[i] for each i from 2 to n.
