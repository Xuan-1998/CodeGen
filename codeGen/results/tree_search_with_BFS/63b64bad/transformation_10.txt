The plan is partially correct but it seems to have a few issues. The first issue is that the program can get into an infinite loop if it keeps visiting the same states over and over again. This can happen if the sequence contains a cycle. The second issue is that the transition from state i to state i+a_{i} and state i-a_{i} is not always possible. The transition to state i+a_{i} is only possible if i+a_{i} is within the range [2, n], and the transition to state i-a_{i} is only possible if i-a_{i} is within the range [2, n]. If the transition is not possible, the program terminates and we should return the current value of y.

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State Expression: dp[i] represents the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}.
2. Transition: From a state i, we can go to two different states. One is the state i+a_{i} where we increase both x and y by a_{i}, the other is the state i-a_{i} where we increase y by a_{i} while decreasing x by a_{i}. If we have already calculated the answer for these states, we can use them to compute the answer for the current state. If the transition is not possible, the program terminates and we return the current value of y.
3. Initialize a dp array with size n+1 and a visited array with size n+1. Set dp[i] = -1 for all i, and visited[i] = False for all i.
4. For each i in the range [2, n], if dp[i] is not calculated yet, we run the program starting from i. We keep track of the current state and the value of y. If we encounter a state that we have visited before, we know that the program is in an infinite loop and we set dp[i] = -1. If the program terminates, we set dp[i] = y.
5. Print dp[i] for each i in the range [2, n].
===END PLAN===
