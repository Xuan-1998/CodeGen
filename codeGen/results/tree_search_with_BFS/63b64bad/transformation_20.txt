The plan is almost correct, but there are a few points that need to be adjusted:

1. The base case is not just dp[1] = 0. We also need to consider the case where x <= 0 or x > n, as mentioned in the problem statement. In these cases, the program terminates immediately, so dp[i] = y for those i.

2. The state dp[i] does not just represent the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. It should also include the current value of x, because the operation depends on both x and y. So the state should be dp[i][x], where i is the current index in the sequence and x is the current value of x.

3. The strategy to avoid infinite loops by setting dp[i] = -1 is not correct. This would mean that we assume the program does not terminate for all i, which is not necessarily the case. Instead, we should use a visited array to keep track of which states we have already visited. If we visit a state that we have already visited before, then we know that the program does not terminate and we can set dp[i][x] = -1.

Here is the updated plan:

1. Initialize an array dp of size n+1 x n+1 to -1 and a boolean array visited of the same size to false. dp[i][x] represents the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n} with current x. visited[i][x] indicates whether we have visited the state (i, x) before.

2. For each i from 1 to n, run a DFS starting from i with x = 1 and y = 0. In the DFS, if x <= 0 or x > n, return y. If visited[i][x] is true, return -1. Otherwise, set visited[i][x] to true and dp[i][x] to the result of the DFS starting from i+ai with x = x+ai and y = y+ai.

3. Print dp[i][1] for each i from 1 to n.
