Your plan seems to be on the right track, but there are a few things you need to consider:

1. The program might never terminate: In this case, you need to output -1. You can detect this by keeping track of the states you've visited. If you visit a state twice, you're in a loop and the program will never terminate. 

2. You're not updating y correctly: In step 2, you're only increasing y by a_{x} once, but you should be doing it twice (once in step 2 and once in step 3).

Considering these points, here's the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-down approach with memoization: This approach starts from the initial state and recursively goes to all the states that we can reach from the current state. We store the result of each state the first time it is computed and then use this value directly for future calls. This approach is usually easier to think of and part of the solution can be used to solve the problem, but it might require more function call overheads.

2. State: The state can be defined as dp[i], which represents the final value of y when the program is run starting from the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}.

3. Base Case: dp[1] = 0, as initially x = 1 and y = 0. If x becomes less than or equal to 0 or greater than n, the program terminates and we return the current value of y.

4. Memoization: Initialize a lookup table (dp) of size n+1 to store the final value of y for each sequence. Set dp[1] = 0. Then, for each i from 2 to n, if dp[i] is not yet calculated, recursively calculate it using the given operations and store it in dp[i]. If dp[i] is already calculated, use the stored value. If during the computation, x becomes less than or equal to 0 or greater than n, return the current value of y.

5. Loop detection: Keep track of the states you've visited in a separate array. If you visit a state twice, you're in a loop and the program will never terminate. In this case, return -1.

6. Updating y: In each step, increase y by a_{x} twice (once in step 2 and once in step 3).
