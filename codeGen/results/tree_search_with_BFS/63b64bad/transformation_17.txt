Your plan seems to be on the right track, but there are a few points that need to be clarified:

1. The base case is not only dp[1] = 0. We also need to consider that if the program does not terminate, dp[i] = -1. This is important as it helps us detect cycles in the sequence and stop the program from running indefinitely.

2. The state definition is correct. However, we also need to keep track of whether we have visited a state before to prevent the program from running indefinitely. We can use an additional array, visited[], for this purpose.

3. The recursive function you mentioned, func(i), is a good idea. However, we need to make sure that we handle the cases where the program does not terminate (i.e., when there is a cycle in the sequence). We can do this by checking whether we have visited the state before. If we have, we return -1.

Here is an updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Create an array dp[] of size n+1 to store the final value of y for each state. Initialize all elements of dp[] to -1 (indicating that we have not computed the final value of y for this state yet).

2. Create an array visited[] of size n+1 to keep track of whether we have visited a state before. Initialize all elements of visited[] to false.

3. Define a recursive function, let's say func(i), which returns the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. The function should do the following:
    - If i <= 0 or i > n, return 0 (indicating that the program has terminated).
    - If visited[i] is true, return -1 (indicating that the program does not terminate).
    - If dp[i] is not -1, return dp[i] (indicating that we have already computed the final value of y for this state).
    - Otherwise, set visited[i] to true and compute the final value of y for this state by first increasing x and y by a[i], then increasing y by a[i] while decreasing x by a[i]. Store the result in dp[i] and return it.

4. For each i from 1 to n, print func(i).
