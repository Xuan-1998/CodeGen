Your plan seems to be on the right track, but it misses a few important points. The problem involves a sequence of operations that might lead to a loop, causing the program to never terminate. Your current plan doesn't account for these loops. 

Here's an updated version of the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State Expression: dp[i] represents the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}.

2. State Transition: We move from state dp[i] to state dp[i+a[i]] if i+a[i] <= n. If the program does not terminate, dp[i] = -1.

3. Tabulation: Initialize an array dp of size n+1 with all elements set to -1. Initialize another array, vis, of size n+1 with all elements set to 0. This array will help us detect loops. If vis[i] == 1, it means we have visited this state before and we are in a loop. If vis[i] == 2, it means we have calculated the result for this state. 

4. For each index i from 1 to n, set dp[i] to 0. 

5. Then, perform a depth-first search (DFS) from each index i from 1 to n. During the DFS, if we encounter a state that we have visited before (vis[i] == 1), we know that we are in a loop and we set dp[i] to -1. If we encounter a state that we have calculated the result for (vis[i] == 2), we add the result to y. After we finish the DFS from a state, we mark it as calculated (vis[i] = 2) and store the result in dp[i].

6. Finally, we print the values of dp[i] for each index i from 1 to n.
===END PLAN===

This plan should cover all edge cases and correctly handle the situations where the program does not terminate. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), which should be efficient enough for the given constraints.
