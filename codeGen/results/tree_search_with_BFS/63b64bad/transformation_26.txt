The plan seems correct as it uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. However, there are a few points that need to be clarified or corrected:

1. The base case should also include the condition that if i + a_{i} > n or i + a_{i} <= 0, dp[i] = a_{i}. This is because if the program cannot move to the next state, it terminates and the final value of y is a_{i}.

2. The transition is not entirely correct. It should be dp[i] = dp[i + a_{i}] + a_{i} if i + a_{i} <= n and dp[i + a_{i}] != -1, else dp[i] = -1. This means that if the program can move to the next state i + a_{i} and it does not lead to an infinite loop (dp[i + a_{i}] != -1), then the current state's value is the next state's value plus a_{i}. Otherwise, if the program cannot move to the next state or it leads to an infinite loop, the current state's value is -1.

3. The condition in the while loop should be while i > 0 and i <= n and dp[i] == -1. This is to ensure that the loop continues until the program terminates or it encounters a state that leads to an infinite loop.

4. The final condition after the while loop is not necessary, as it is already covered in the base case and transition.

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize an array dp of size n+1 with all elements as -1. This array will be used to store the final value of y for each state. Set dp[1] = 0, because initially y = 0.

2. For each state i from 2 to n, do the following:
   - If dp[i] is not -1, continue to the next state. This means that the final value of y for this state has already been calculated.
   - Otherwise, start a while loop with the condition i > 0 and i <= n and dp[i] == -1. In each iteration of the loop, first check if i + a_{i} > n or i + a_{i} <= 0. If it is true, set dp[i] = a_{i} and break the loop. Otherwise, increase i by a_{i}.
   - After the loop, if dp[i] is still -1, set it to dp[i + a_{i}] + a_{i} if i + a_{i} <= n and dp[i + a_{i}] != -1, else dp[i] = -1.

3. Print the elements of dp from 2 to n. Each element dp[i] is the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. If dp[i] is -1, it means that the program does not terminate.
===END PLAN===
