The plan you provided is a good start, but it has a few issues and can be improved. Here's an updated version of the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. We will use a top-down strategy with memoization. This approach starts from the initial state and recursively calculates the answer for each state. If we have already calculated the answer for a state, we use this to avoid redundant computations. This approach is usually easier to implement and understand, but it may require more function call overheads.

2. We will use Depth-First Search (DFS) to simulate the execution of the program. The DFS function will take the current position as a parameter and return the final value of y if the program terminates, or -1 if the program does not terminate.

3. Base Case: If the current position is out of bounds (x ≤ 0 or x > n), the program terminates and we return 0.

4. If we have already visited the current position and have not calculated the final value of y for this position yet, it means that we are in a cycle and the program will not terminate, so we return -1.

5. If we have already calculated the final value of y for the current position, we return this value.

6. We mark the current position as visited and recursively call the DFS function for the next position (x + a_x for step 2, and x - a_x for step 3), adding a_x to the result.

7. After the DFS function returns, we store the final value of y for the current position in a memoization table for future reference.

8. Initialize an array dp of size n+1 with all elements as -1, and another boolean array visited of size n+1 with all elements as False. dp[1] = 0 and visited[1] = True.
===END PLAN===

This plan should cover all edge cases, including the case where the program does not terminate. The main potential issue with this plan is that the DFS function could exceed the maximum recursion depth if the sequence is very large, but this is unlikely to happen with the given constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5).
