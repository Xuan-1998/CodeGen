The plan seems mostly correct, but there are some parts that need to be clarified. 

1. State Expression: dp[i] represents the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. We will also need an array, visited[i], to keep track of whether a state has been visited.

2. Transition: From a state i, we can go to two different states. One is the state i+a_{i} where we increase both x and y by a_{i}, the other is the state i-a_{i} where we increase y by a_{i} while decreasing x by a_{i}. If we have already calculated the answer for these states, we can use them to compute the answer for the current state.

3. We will start by initializing all dp[i] to -1 and visited[i] to false. Then for each i from 2 to n, if not visited[i], perform a depth-first search from state i. Keep track of the current sum in the search. If during the search we reach a state that we have visited before, return -1. If we reach a state where x <= 0 or x > n, return the current sum. 

4. During the depth-first search, we first mark the current state as visited. Then we check the next state, which is i+a_{i}. If it is not visited, we add a_{i} to the current sum and recursively call the depth-first search on the next state. If the returned value is not -1, it means we have found a terminating sequence, so we update dp[i] with the returned value plus a_{i} and return this value. If it is -1, it means the sequence does not terminate, so we return -1.

5. After the depth-first search, if dp[i] is still -1, it means the sequence does not terminate from state i, so we print -1. Otherwise, we print dp[i].

This plan should handle all cases, including when the sequence does not terminate. The only potential issue is that the depth-first search may take too long if the sequence is very long or has many cycles. However, this can be mitigated by the fact that we are memoizing the results and marking states as visited, which prevents us from repeatedly exploring the same states.
