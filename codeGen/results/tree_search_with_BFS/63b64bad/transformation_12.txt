Your plan is mostly correct, but there are a few points that need to be addressed:

1. You need to be careful about states that are revisited during the depth-first search (DFS). If a state is revisited, it means there's a cycle and the program will never terminate. So, you should mark states as visited during the DFS and if you encounter a visited state that hasn't been assigned a final value yet, you should assign it a value of -1. This is because finding a visited state indicates a cycle, and hence the program will never terminate.

2. You should also consider the bounds of the array. If the next state is out of bounds, the program terminates and you can assign the current value of y to the state.

3. You need to initialize your dp array with a special value (like -2) to indicate that a state hasn't been visited yet. A value of -1 should be used to indicate that the program does not terminate for that state.

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize a dp array of size n+1 with the value -2. dp[i] represents the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}.
2. For each state from 1 to n, if dp[i] is -2, perform a depth-first search starting from i.
3. During the DFS, keep track of the current state and the value of y. Mark the current state as visited by setting dp[i] to -1.
4. From a state i, we can go to two different states: i+a_{i} and i-a_{i}. Check the next state:
   - If the next state is out of bounds, the program terminates and you can assign the current value of y to dp[i] and return.
   - If dp[next_state] is not -2, it means we have already calculated the answer for the next state or found a cycle. In this case, assign dp[next_state] to dp[i] and return.
   - Otherwise, continue the DFS with the next state and y + a_{i}.
5. After the DFS, if dp[i] is not -1, for all states j that we have visited in the search, set dp[j] = dp[i].
===END PLAN===
