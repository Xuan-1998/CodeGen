Your plan is on the right track, but there are a few improvements that could be made. 

1. You're correct about using dynamic programming, but you need two states to keep track of the results: one to store whether a state has been visited (to check for infinite loops), and one to store the final value of y (if it exists).

2. You're correct about the base case, but you need to initialize all dp[i] to -1, because we don't know the final value of y yet. Also, you need another array, visited[i], to keep track of whether a state has been visited. Initially, all visited[i] are false.

3. The state definition is correct, but you need another state: visited[i] represents whether the program has visited the state i.

4. For the transition, you need to consider two cases. If visited[i] is true and dp[i] is -1, it means we have an infinite loop, so we return -1. Otherwise, if visited[i] is false, we mark it as true and recursively call the function for the next state (i + a[i] and i - a[i]) and add a[i] to the result.

5. Finally, you need to call the function for each i from 2 to n (not 1 to n, because the sequence starts from a_2, not a_1), and print the returned value.

Here is the updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize two arrays, dp and visited, of size n+1. Set all dp[i] to -1 and all visited[i] to false. dp[i] represents the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}, and visited[i] represents whether the program has visited the state i.
2. Define a function, func(i), which returns the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. If visited[i] is true and dp[i] is -1, return -1 (indicating an infinite loop). If visited[i] is false, mark it as true, recursively call the function for the next state (i + a[i] and i - a[i]), add a[i] to the result, and store the result in dp[i].
3. Call the function func(i) for each i from 2 to n and print the returned value.
===END PLAN===
