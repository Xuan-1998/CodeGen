Your plan seems to be on the right track, but there are some issues that need to be addressed:

1. The base case of dp[1] = 0 is not always correct. Remember that we are considering sequences of the form i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. So, for different i, the base case will be different.

2. The transition function seems to be incorrect. We need to consider two operations: first, increase x and y by a_{x}, then increase y by a_{x} and decrease x by a_{x}. This means that the transition should be something like dp[i] = a_{i} + dp[i + a_{i}] if i + a_{i} is within the range [2, n], else dp[i] = a_{i}.

3. We also need to handle cycles in the sequence. If we reach a state that we've already visited, that means the program will never terminate. We can handle this by keeping track of the visited states. If we visit a state twice, we can stop the program and return -1.

Here is an updated version of the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize a dp array with size n+1, all elements set to -1, indicating that we haven't computed the result for the corresponding sequence yet.
2. Initialize a visited array with size n+1, all elements set to false.
3. For each i from 1 to n:
   1. Set dp[i] = 0 and visited[i] = true.
   2. While x (initialized to i) is within the range [2, n] and dp[x] is -1 (meaning we haven't computed the result for this sequence yet):
      1. If visited[x] is true, this means we've reached a state that we've already visited, so the program will never terminate. In this case, set dp[i] to -1 and break the loop.
      2. Otherwise, set visited[x] to true, increase y (initialized to 0) by a_{x}, and change x to x + a_{x}.
   3. If dp[i] is not -1 (meaning the program has terminated), set dp[i] to y.
4. Print dp[i] for each i from 1 to n.
===END PLAN===
