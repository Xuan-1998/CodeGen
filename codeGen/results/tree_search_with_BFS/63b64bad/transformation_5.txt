Your plan is good as a starting point, but it misses a few key aspects of the problem. The problem is a bit more complex than typical dynamic programming problems because the sequence of operations can loop indefinitely. So, we need to detect when we're in a loop and return -1 in such cases.

Here's an updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. The state can be defined as dp[i], which represents the final value of y when the program is run starting from the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. We initialize a table (dp) of size n+1 to store the final value of y for each sequence. Set dp[1] = 0.

2. We also need a way to detect loops. For this, we can use a visited array of size n+1. If visited[x] is true, it means we've visited the sequence starting from x before, and we're in a loop. In this case, we return -1.

3. For each i from 2 to n, we calculate dp[i] using a recursive function, solve(x), which performs the operations and returns the final value of y when the program is run starting from the sequence x, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}.

4. In solve(x), if x <= 0 or x > n, we return 0. If visited[x] is true, we return -1. Otherwise, we mark x as visited and recursively call solve(x + a[x]) and solve(x - a[x]), adding a[x] to the result each time. We store the result in dp[x] and return it.

5. Finally, we print dp[i] for each i from 2 to n.
===END PLAN===

This plan should cover all edge cases and correctly handle the possibility of infinite loops. The time complexity is O(n) because each state is computed once, and the space complexity is also O(n) due to the dp and visited arrays.
