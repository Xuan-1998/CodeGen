Your plan seems quite good and it covers the main idea of the problem. However, there are a few points that need to be corrected or clarified:

1. State Expression: dp[i] represents the final value of y when the program starts from the position i.
2. We need to keep track of the states that we have visited during the current DFS to detect cycles. If we encounter a state that we have visited during the current DFS, it means that the program enters a cycle and will never terminate, so we should return -1.
3. The initial value of dp[i] should be a special value indicating that the state i has not been visited yet. We can use -2 for this purpose. If dp[i] is -1, it means that the program does not terminate starting from i. If dp[i] is non-negative, it is the final value of y when the program starts from i.
4. During the DFS, if we meet a node that has been calculated (dp[i] is non-negative), we return dp[i] directly. If we meet a node that is being visited (dp[i] is -1), we return -1. Otherwise, we mark the node as being visited by setting dp[i] to -1, then we recursively call the DFS function for the next state (i + a[i] if i is odd, and i - a[i] if i is even), and add a[i] to the result. If the result is -1, it means that the program does not terminate, so we return -1. Otherwise, we update dp[i] with the result and return it.
5. We call the DFS function for each i from 2 to n and print dp[i].

Here is the updated plan:

1. Create an array dp of size n+1 and initialize it with -2. This array is used for memoization. dp[i] represents the final value of y when the program starts from the position i. If dp[i] is -1, it means that the program does not terminate starting from i. If dp[i] is non-negative, it is the final value of y when the program starts from i.
2. Create a helper function dfs(i) to perform a DFS from the position i. This function returns the final value of y when the program starts from i, or -1 if the program does not terminate.
3. In the dfs(i) function, if dp[i] is non-negative, return dp[i] directly. If dp[i] is -1, return -1. Otherwise, mark the position i as being visited by setting dp[i] to -1, then call the dfs function for the next position (i + a[i] if i is odd, and i - a[i] if i is even), and add a[i] to the result. If the result is -1, return -1. Otherwise, update dp[i] with the result and return it.
4. Call the dfs function for each i from 2 to n and print dp[i].
