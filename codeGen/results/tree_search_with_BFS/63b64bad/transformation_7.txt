Your plan looks good and it correctly uses the concept of dynamic programming to solve the problem. However, it seems to have a few issues. 

Firstly, the base case should be that if x becomes less than or equal to 0 or greater than n, the program terminates and we return the current value of y. However, the base case should be dp[i] = -1 for i not equal to 1, because we only start from x = 1 and any other starting position is invalid.

Secondly, the transition is not completely correct. You are right that we increase x and y by a_{x} simultaneously, but after that, we only increase y by a_{x} and decrease x by a_{x}. So the transition should be dp[i] = a_{i} + dp[i + a_{i}] if i + a_{i} is within the range [1, n], else dp[i] = a_{i}.

Thirdly, we need to handle cycles. If the program enters a cycle, it will never terminate. We can use a visited array to keep track of which indices we have visited. If we visit an index that we have visited before, we know that the program has entered a cycle and we should return -1.

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize an array dp of size n+1 with all elements as -1 and a visited array of size n+1 with all elements as False. dp[i] represents the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. visited[i] represents whether we have visited index i or not.
2. For each i from 1 to n, compute dp[i] using a recursive function. The function takes an index i as input and does the following:
   a. If i is less than or equal to 0 or greater than n, return 0.
   b. If visited[i] is True, return -1. This is because the program has entered a cycle.
   c. If dp[i] is not -1, return dp[i]. This is because we have already computed the final value of y for this index.
   d. Set visited[i] to True.
   e. Compute dp[i] as a_{i} + the result of the recursive function with input i + a_{i}.
   f. If the result of the recursive function is -1, set dp[i] to -1. This is because the program has entered a cycle.
   g. Set visited[i] to False.
   h. Return dp[i].
3. Print dp[i] for each i from 1 to n.
===END PLAN===
