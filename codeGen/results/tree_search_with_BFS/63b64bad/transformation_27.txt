Your plan seems correct in terms of the dynamic programming approach, but there are a few points that need to be addressed:

1. The problem statement specifies that we have to increase both x and y by a_{x} simultaneously, and then increase y by a_{x} while decreasing x by a_{x}. So, we need to take this into account in our transition function. 

2. To handle the cases where the program does not terminate, we can use a visited array to keep track of the states we have already visited. If we encounter a state that we have already visited, we know that the program will not terminate and we can set dp[i] to -1. 

3. We need to be careful with the indices. The sequence starts from a_2, so we need to adjust our indices accordingly. 

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize a dp array of size n+1 with -1 and a visited array of size n+1 with False. The dp array will store the final value of y for each run of the program. The visited array will keep track of the states we have already visited. 

2. Base Case: dp[1] = 0, because initially y = 0. 

3. Transition: For each i from n to 2 (in decreasing order), do the following:

    a. If visited[i] is True, then we know that the program will not terminate and we can set dp[i] to -1.

    b. If visited[i] is False, then we set visited[i] to True and check the next state i - a_{i}. If i - a_{i} is within the range [1, n] and dp[i - a_{i}] is not -1, then we can update dp[i] to 2 * a_{i} + dp[i - a_{i}]. Otherwise, we set dp[i] to -1.

4. The final answer will be in dp[2], dp[3], ..., dp[n].
===END PLAN===
