Your plan seems mostly correct, but there are a few points to consider:

1. In your transition, you should consider the case where the program does not terminate. This happens when you visit a state that you have already visited before. You should keep track of whether you have visited a state before to handle this.

2. In your memoization, you need to be careful with cycles. If you encounter a state that you are currently computing (i.e., you have visited it before and have not yet stored a result in dp), it means you have found a cycle and the program will not terminate.

3. You need to handle the case where `i + a[i]` is out of bounds. If `i + a[i] <= 0` or `i + a[i] > n`, the program terminates and you should return `a[i]`.

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-down approach with memoization: This approach starts from the initial state and recursively goes to all the states that we can reach from the current state. We store the result of each state the first time it is computed and then use this value directly for future calls.
2. State Expression: `dp[i]` represents the final value of `y` when the program is run on the sequence `i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}`. If `dp[i]` is `-1`, it means the program does not terminate.
3. Transition: If `i + a[i] <= 0` or `i + a[i] > n`, `dp[i] = a[i]`. Else if the program enters a state it has visited before, we can conclude that it will not terminate, hence `dp[i] = -1`. Else `dp[i] = dp[i + a[i]] + a[i]`.
4. Memoization: This approach involves creating an auxiliary `dp` array and filling it with `-1` as initial value. Then we write a recursive function `solve(i)` that returns `dp[i]` if it's not `-1`. If `i + a[i] <= 0` or `i + a[i] > n`, return `a[i]`. Else, if `dp[i + a[i]]` is not `-1`, return `dp[i] = solve(i + a[i]) + a[i]`. Else, return `dp[i] = -1`.
5. We also need to maintain a `visited` array to keep track of the states we have visited. If we visit a state that we have already visited and have not yet stored a result in `dp`, it means we have found a cycle and the program will not terminate. In this case, we should return `-1`.
===END PLAN===
