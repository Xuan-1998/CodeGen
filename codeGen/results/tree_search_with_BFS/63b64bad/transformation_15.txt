The plan is almost correct, but it has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The base case is not correct. The base case should be when x is out of bounds, which means x ≤ 0 or x > n. In this case, we should return 0 because y does not increase anymore.

2. The state transition is not correct. When x + a[x] <= n or x - a[x] > 0, we should increase y by a[x] and then recursively call the function with the new x. If x + a[x] > n or x - a[x] <= 0, the program terminates and we return y.

3. We need to handle the case where the program does not terminate. We can use a visited array to track which x we have visited. If we visit an x that we have visited before, we know the program does not terminate and we return -1.

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State Expression: dp[i] represents the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}.

2. Base case: The base case is when x ≤ 0 or x > n. In this case, we return 0 because y does not increase anymore.

3. Memoization: Initialize a dp array of size n+1 with all elements as -1. Initialize a visited array of size n+1 with all elements as false. Create a helper function that takes x as input. If x ≤ 0 or x > n, return 0. If visited[x] is true, return -1. If dp[x] != -1, return dp[x]. Set visited[x] to true. If x + a[x] <= n, then dp[x] = max(dp[x], helper(x + a[x]) + a[x]). If x - a[x] > 0, then dp[x] = max(dp[x], helper(x - a[x]) + a[x]). Return dp[x].

4. Iteratively calculate dp[i] for i from 2 to n using the helper function and print dp[i] for i from 2 to n.
===END PLAN===
