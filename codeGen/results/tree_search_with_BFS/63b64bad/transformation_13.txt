The plan is generally correct, but it overlooks a few key points. The main issue is that the program may not terminate, which the current plan does not handle. The program will not terminate if it enters a cycle, i.e., if it visits the same state more than once. This can occur if the program returns to the same index, or if it repeatedly alternates between two or more indices. In this case, the final value of y is undefined, so we should output -1.

Moreover, the current plan does not specify how to initialize the dp array. In this problem, we can initialize all values in the dp array as -1, which represents that the final value of y is not yet determined. 

Here is the updated plan:

1. Define the state dp[i] to represent the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. Initialize all values in the dp array as -1.

2. Define a boolean array visited[i] to track whether we have visited the state i. Initialize all values in the visited array as false.

3. Use a bottom-up strategy with tabulation. Start from the state 2 and iteratively calculate the answer for each state. 

4. From a state i, we can go to two different states: i+a_{i} and i-a_{i}. If we have not visited these states, recursively calculate the answer for them. If we have visited a state and its dp value is -1, it means we have entered a cycle, so return -1. If we have visited a state and its dp value is not -1, it means we have calculated the answer for this state, so return the dp value.

5. During the calculation of each state, mark the state as visited and update the dp value.

6. Finally, print dp[i] for all i from 2 to n. If dp[i] is -1, it means the program does not terminate when running on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}.
