Your plan seems almost correct and it's a good start, but there are some points that need to be addressed:

1. You are correct that this is a dynamic programming problem, and your approach of using a bottom-up strategy with tabulation is a good one.

2. Your base case is correct, but you should also consider that if `i + a_{i}` is greater than `n`, the program also terminates and `dp[i] = a_{i}`.

3. Your transition is almost correct, but it's not enough to check if `dp[i + a_{i}] != -1` to avoid infinite loops. You need to keep track of the states you've already visited during your current calculation, and if you visit a state you've already visited during the current calculation, you have an infinite loop and should set `dp[i] = -1`.

4. As for edge cases, you need to consider the case where `a_{i}` is 1, because in this case `i + a_{i}` may be equal to `i`, causing an infinite loop.

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Use a bottom-up dynamic programming strategy with tabulation. This approach starts from the most basic state and iteratively calculates the answer for each state. Once we have calculated the answer for a state, we use this to compute the answer for other states. This approach is usually more efficient and requires less function call overheads, but it may require more thinking to determine the order of states.
2. Initialize an array `dp` of size `n+1` with all values as -2, which represents states not calculated yet. `dp[1] = 0` because initially `y = 0`.
3. Initialize an array `visited` of size `n+1` with all values as false, which represents states not visited during the current calculation.
4. For each `i` from 1 to `n`, if `dp[i]` is -2, start a loop from `i` and keep updating `x` and `y` as per the given rules until `x` is not in the range [1, `n`] or `dp[x]` is not -2. If `x` is not in the range [1, `n`], `dp[i] = y`. If `dp[x]` is not -2, `dp[i] = y + dp[x]`. If `visited[x]` is true, `dp[i] = -1`. Set `visited[x]` as true at the start of each iteration of the loop.
5. Finally, the array `dp` contains the answer for each state.
