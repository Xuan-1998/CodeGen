The plan you have proposed seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The transition function in your dynamic programming approach seems to be incorrect. The transition should be based on the operations described in the problem statement. According to the problem, the program increases both x and y by a value equal to a_{x} simultaneously. Then, the program increases y by a_{x} while decreasing x by a_{x}. So, the transition should be a bit more complex than what you have proposed.

2. The base case is not completely correct. The base case should be when x > n or x <= 0, then the program terminates and we return the current value of y.

3. You need to keep track of the visited states to detect infinite loops. If a state is visited twice, it means the program is in an infinite loop and we should return -1.

Here is an updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize an array dp of size n+1 with all elements as -1. This array will store the final value of y for each possible value of x. Also, initialize an array visited of size n+1 with all elements as False. This array will help us detect infinite loops.

2. Base Case: If x <= 0 or x > n, the program terminates and we return the current value of y (which is stored in dp[x]).

3. For each i from 2 to n, do the following:
    a. If dp[i] is not -1, it means we have already computed the final value of y for this value of x. So, we continue to the next iteration.
    b. Initialize x = i and y = 0. While x > 0 and x <= n and visited[x] is False, do the following:
        i. Set visited[x] to True.
        ii. Update x and y according to the operations described in the problem statement: increase both x and y by a_{x} simultaneously, then increase y by a_{x} while decreasing x by a_{x}.
        iii. If x <= 0 or x > n, the program terminates and we update dp[i] with the current value of y.
        iv. If visited[x] is True, it means the program is in an infinite loop. In this case, we break the loop and dp[i] remains -1.

4. Finally, print the elements of dp from 2 to n. Each element dp[i] is the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. If dp[i] is -1, it means the program does not terminate for this sequence.
===END PLAN===
