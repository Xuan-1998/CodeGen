Your plan seems to be on the right track. However, it's a little bit unclear and lacks some necessary details. Here is an updated version of the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===

1. Create a list `dp` of size `n+1` to store the final value of `y` for each sequence. Initialize it with `None`.

2. Create a list `visited` of size `n+1` to mark the sequences that have been visited. Initialize it with `False`.

3. The base case is `dp[1] = 0`, because initially `y = 0`.

4. Define a recursive function `dfs(i)`. In this function, if `i` is out of range (i.e., `i <= 0 or i > n`), return `0`. If `dp[i]` is not `None`, return `dp[i]`. If `visited[i]` is `True`, it means the program does not terminate, so return `-1`. Otherwise, set `visited[i]` to `True` and call `dfs(i + a[i])`. If the result is `-1`, set `dp[i]` to `-1`. Otherwise, set `dp[i]` to `a[i] + result`.

5. For each `i` from `2` to `n`, call `dfs(i)` and print `dp[i]`.

6. This approach uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations and DFS to simulate the process of the program.

===END PLAN===
