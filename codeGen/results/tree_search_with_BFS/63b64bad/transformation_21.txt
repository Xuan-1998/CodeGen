The plan you have is a good start, but there are some issues and potential improvements to be made. 

1. The problem statement says that the program increases both x and y by a value equal to a_{x} simultaneously, and then increases y by a_{x} while decreasing x by a_{x}. This means that x changes by 2*a_{x} in each iteration, not a_{x}. Therefore, the recursive calls should be func(i + 2*a[i]) and func(i - 2*a[i]), not func(i + a[i]) and func(i - a[i]).

2. The base case is not completely correct. dp[1] = 0 is correct, but dp[i] = -1 only if the program does not terminate. If the program terminates, then dp[i] should be the final value of y.

3. The problem statement says that if, after any step, x â‰¤ 0 or x > n, the program immediately terminates. This means that if i + 2*a[i] <= 0 or i + 2*a[i] > n, then the program terminates and dp[i] = y. Similarly, if i - 2*a[i] <= 0 or i - 2*a[i] > n, then the program terminates and dp[i] = y.

4. The problem statement also says that the program increases y by a_{x} after increasing both x and y by a value equal to a_{x}. This means that y should be increased by 2*a_{x} in each iteration, not a_{x}. Therefore, the value of y should be calculated as y + 2*a[i], not y + a[i].

5. The problem statement says that the task is to determine the final value of y for each run of the program on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. This means that we need to run the program for each value of i from 2 to n.

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State: dp[i] represents the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}.
2. Base Case: dp[1] = 0. If the program does not terminate, dp[i] = -1. If the program terminates, dp[i] = y.
3. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: Start from the most basic state and iteratively calculate the answer for each state. Once the answer for a state has been calculated, use this to compute the answer for other states.
4. For each i from 2 to n, if i + 2*a[i] <= 0 or i + 2*a[i] > n, then the program terminates and dp[i] = y. If i - 2*a[i] <= 0 or i - 2*a[i] > n, then the program terminates and dp[i] = y. Otherwise, calculate the value of y by recursively calling the function func(i + 2*a[i]) and func(i - 2*a[i]) and taking their maximum. Add 2*a[i] to the result and store it in dp[i].
