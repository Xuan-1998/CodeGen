The intuition and the high-level plan seem to be on the right track, but there are some issues with the plan. Here is an updated version of the plan that addresses these issues:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State: dp[i] represents the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. We also need an additional array, visited[i], to keep track of whether we have visited the state i before. This is necessary to detect cycles, which indicate that the program does not terminate.

2. Base Case: dp[1] = 0, because initially y = 0. If the program does not terminate, dp[i] = -1.

3. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This approach starts from the most basic state and iteratively calculates the answer for each state. Once we have calculated the answer for a state, we use this to compute the answer for other states. This approach is usually more efficient and requires less function call overheads, but it may require more thinking to determine the order of states.

4. In the function func(i), first check if i <= 0 or i > n. If this is the case, return 0 (the program terminates without any increment in y). 

5. If we have visited state i before (visited[i] = true), then we are in a cycle and the program does not terminate. In this case, return -1.

6. If we have not visited state i before, mark it as visited (visited[i] = true) and recursively call func(i + a[i]) to compute the value of y. If the recursive call returns -1, set dp[i] = -1. Otherwise, set dp[i] = a[i] + the value returned by the recursive call.

7. After computing dp[i] for all i, output the values of dp[i] for i = 2, 3, ..., n.
===END PLAN===

This plan covers the edge cases where the program does not terminate. The use of a visited array to detect cycles is a common technique in problems involving graphs or state transitions. This plan should work correctly given the constraints of the problem.
