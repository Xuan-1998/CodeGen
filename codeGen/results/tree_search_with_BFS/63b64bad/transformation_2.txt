Your plan seems almost correct but it has a few issues. In your transition, you're assuming that if `i + a[i] > n`, then the program terminates and `dp[i] = a[i]`. But this is not necessarily true, the program also terminates if `i + a[i] <= 0` which you didn't consider. Also, in your tabulation, you're marking `dp[i]` as visited but you didn't specify what value you're using to mark it. Furthermore, you didn't specify what you're doing when `dp[j + a[j]]` is visited. Here's the corrected plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. We'll use a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization. This approach starts from the initial state and recursively goes to all the states that we can reach from the current state. We store the result of each state the first time it is computed and then use this value directly for future calls. This approach is usually easier to think of and part of the solution can be used to solve the problem, but it might require more function call overheads.
2. State Expression: `dp[i]` represents the final value of `y` when the program is run on the sequence `i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}`. If `dp[i]` is `-1`, it means the program does not terminate.
3. Transition: `dp[i] = dp[i + a[i]] + a[i]` if `0 < i + a[i] <= n`, else `dp[i] = a[i]`. If the program enters a state it has visited before, we can conclude that it will not terminate, hence `dp[i] = -1`.
4. Tabulation: This approach involves filling up an `n+1`-dimensional `dp` table in a bottom-up manner. We start from the base state and compute all other states using the state transition relation. This approach is more efficient but sometimes it can be tricky to find the order of filling the states. The pseudo code can be: Initialize `dp[n+1]` array with `-1`. For `i` from `1` to `n`, if `dp[i]` is not `-1`, continue. If `i + a[i]` is not in `(0, n]`, `dp[i] = a[i]`. Else, mark `dp[i]` as `0` (indicating it's visited) and set `j = i`. While `0 < j + a[j] <= n` and `dp[j + a[j]]` is `0` (not visited), set `j = j + a[j]`. If `j + a[j]` is not in `(0, n]` or `dp[j + a[j]]` is not `0`, set `k = i`. While `k != j`, `dp[k] = dp[k + a[k]] + a[k]`, `k = k + a[k]`. If `0 < j + a[j] <= n`, `dp[j] = -1`.
