2. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This method involves solving smaller subproblems first and using their solutions to build up the solution to the original problem. It is typically implemented using iterative loops and a table to store intermediate results.
1. State Expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of ways to form a subtree with i vertices and j good vertices. Base Case: dp[0][0] = 1, meaning there's one way to form an empty subtree with zero vertices and zero good vertices.
2. Transition Relationship: For each vertex count i from 1 to N and each good vertex count j from 0 to i, calculate dp[i][j] by considering all possible ways to split the vertex set into subtrees. If you add a new vertex as a root, the number of ways to form the subtree is derived from combining subtrees of the remaining vertices. Specifically, dp[i][j] can be computed using previously computed values of dp for smaller subproblems, summed over all valid splits of vertices and good vertices.
3. Calculate the number of good vertices for each subtree configuration and sum them up. Keep track of the total sum modulo 998244353.
4. Iterate through all possible configurations and compute the final result by summing up the count of good vertices for each valid tree configuration.
5. Return the final result as the sum of the numbers of good vertices for all good trees, modulo 998244353.
