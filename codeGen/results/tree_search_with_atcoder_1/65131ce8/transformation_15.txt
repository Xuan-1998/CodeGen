1. State Expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of ways to form a subtree with i vertices and j good vertices. Base Case: dp[0][0] = 1, meaning there's one way to form an empty subtree with zero vertices and zero good vertices.
2. Transition Relationship: For each vertex count i from 1 to N and each good vertex count j from 0 to i, calculate dp[i][j] by considering all possible ways to split the vertex set into subtrees. If you add a new vertex as a root, the number of ways to form the subtree is derived from combining subtrees of the remaining vertices. Specifically, dp[i][j] can be computed using previously computed values of dp for smaller subproblems, summed over all valid splits of vertices and good vertices.
3. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This method involves solving smaller subproblems first and using their solutions to build up the solution to the original problem. It is typically implemented using iterative loops and a table to store intermediate results.
4. Calculate the final result by summing up the number of good vertices for all possible subtree sizes from 1 to N, considering the given out-degree constraints.
5. Edge Cases: Handle cases where d[i] = 0 for all i except for the root, ensuring the tree structure is valid.
