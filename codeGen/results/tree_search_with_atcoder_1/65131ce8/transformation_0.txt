1. Define a function `count_good_trees(d)` that takes the sequence `d` as input and returns the sum of the numbers of good vertices for all good trees, modulo 998244353.
2. Initialize a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to form a subtree with `i` vertices where the root has an out-degree of `j`. Base case: `dp[1][0] = 1`, since a single vertex with no children is a valid subtree.
3. Define a recursive function `compute_dp(i, j)` that fills the DP table using memoization. This function should consider adding a new vertex to an existing subtree or forming new subtrees by combining smaller subtrees.
4. For each `i` from 2 to N, and for each `j` from 0 to `d[i-1]`, compute `dp[i][j]` by summing over all possible ways to distribute the vertices among the children of the root. Use the formula:
