1. Define the problem using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation. This method involves solving smaller subproblems first and using their solutions to build up the solution to the original problem. It is typically implemented using iterative loops and a table to store intermediate results.
2. State Expression: Define dp[i][j] as the number of ways to form a subtree with i vertices and j good vertices. 
3. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1, indicating there's one way to form a subtree with one vertex (the root itself) which is also a good vertex.
4. Transition: To fill the dp table, consider adding a new vertex to an existing subtree. The new vertex can either become a good vertex or not. Update the dp table accordingly based on the out-degree constraints given by the array d.
5. Ensure that the out-degree constraints are respected while updating the dp table. This involves checking that the sum of out-degrees of the vertices in any subtree does not exceed the total number of vertices minus one.
6. Final Computation: The answer will be the sum of dp[N][j] for all j, modulo 998244353.
7. Edge Cases: Consider edge cases such as when all vertices have an out-degree of 0 (forming a straight line tree) or when the root has the maximum out-degree.
