1. Top-down approach with memoization: This method involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems to avoid redundant computations. It is typically implemented using recursion with a cache to store intermediate results.
2. State expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of ways to form a subtree with i vertices where the root has an out-degree of j. Base case: dp[1][0] = 1, since a single vertex with no children is a valid subtree.
3. Transition: To compute dp[i][j], consider adding a new vertex to an existing subtree or forming new subtrees by combining smaller subtrees. This involves summing over all possible ways to distribute the vertices among the children of the root.
4. Iterate over all possible subtree sizes and out-degrees to fill the dp table. For each subtree size and out-degree, calculate the number of ways to form the subtree by considering all possible distributions of the remaining vertices among the children.
5. Sum up the number of good vertices by checking the condition f(v) = v for each vertex in the subtree. This can be done by iterating over all vertices and checking if they are the minimum vertex number in their subtree.
6. Return the sum of the numbers of good vertices for all good trees, modulo 998244353.
