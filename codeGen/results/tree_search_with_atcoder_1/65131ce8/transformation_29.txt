1. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This method involves solving smaller subproblems first and using their solutions to build up the solution to the original problem. It is typically implemented using iterative loops and a table to store intermediate results.
2. State Expression: Define dp[i][j] as the number of ways to form a subtree with i vertices and j good vertices. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1, indicating there's one way to form a subtree with one vertex (the root itself) which is also a good vertex.
3. Transition: For each vertex i from 1 to N, and for each possible number of good vertices j from 1 to i, calculate dp[i][j] by considering all possible ways to distribute the out-degrees among the children of the vertex i.
4. Handle the out-degree constraints by ensuring that the sum of out-degrees equals N-1 and each vertex has the specified out-degree.
5. Final Computation: The answer will be the sum of dp[N][j] for all j, modulo 998244353.
6. Edge Cases: Consider cases where the out-degrees are all zero except for the root, or where they are distributed unevenly.
