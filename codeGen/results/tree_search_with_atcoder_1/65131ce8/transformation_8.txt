1. Top-down approach with memoization: This method involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems to avoid redundant computations. It is typically implemented using recursion with a cache to store intermediate results.
2. State expression: Let dp[v][k] be the number of ways to form a subtree rooted at vertex v with exactly k good vertices. Base case: dp[v][0] = 1 for all v, since there is exactly one way to form a subtree with zero good vertices (an empty subtree).
3. Transition: For each vertex v, iterate through its children and update the dp table accordingly. Specifically, for each child c of v, update dp[v][k] based on the dp values of c and the current state of dp[v].
4. Combine results: After processing all children of v, combine the results to get the final dp values for v.
5. Sum the results: After processing all vertices, sum up the dp values to get the total number of good vertices for all good trees.
6. Handle edge cases: Ensure that the implementation handles edge cases such as when N is at its minimum value or when all d_i values are zero.
