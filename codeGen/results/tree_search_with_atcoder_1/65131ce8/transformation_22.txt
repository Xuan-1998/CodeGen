2. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This method involves solving smaller subproblems first and using their solutions to build up the solution to the original problem. It is typically implemented using iterative loops and a table to store intermediate results.
3. State Expression: Define dp[i][j] as the number of ways to form a subtree with i vertices and j good vertices. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1, indicating there's one way to form a subtree with one vertex (the root itself) which is also a good vertex.
4. Transition Relation: For each vertex, consider it as a root and partition the remaining vertices into subtrees. Use previously solved subproblems to determine the number of ways to distribute the vertices while maintaining the good vertex property.
5. Iterate over all possible sizes of subtrees and number of good vertices to fill the dp table.
6. Sum up the number of good vertices for all possible subtree sizes to get the final result.
7. Handle edge cases such as when all vertices have out-degree 0 (only leaves) or when the out-degree distribution is not valid.
