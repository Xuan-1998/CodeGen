===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State Definition: Define dp[i][j] as the number of ways to form a subtree with i vertices and j good vertices.
2. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1, indicating there's one way to form a subtree with one vertex (the root itself) which is also a good vertex.
3. Recurrence Relation: To build the dp table, consider adding a new vertex to a previously formed subtree. If we add a vertex as a child to an existing vertex, update the dp table accordingly. The new vertex can either be a good vertex or not, depending on its position and the structure of the subtree.
4. Iterate through all possible subtree sizes and the number of good vertices to fill the dp table using the recurrence relation.
5. Sum the number of good vertices for all possible subtrees to get the final result.
6. Return the result modulo 998244353.
