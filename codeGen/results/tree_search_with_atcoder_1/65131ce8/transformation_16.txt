1. State Expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of ways to form a subtree with i vertices and j good vertices. Base Case: dp[0][0] = 1, meaning there's one way to form an empty subtree with zero vertices and zero good vertices.
2. Transition Formula: dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][m] * dp[i-1-k][j-1-m] for all valid k, m) where k is the number of vertices in one subtree and m is the number of good vertices in that subtree. This accounts for all possible ways to distribute the vertices and good vertices among the subtrees.
3. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This method involves solving smaller subproblems first and using their solutions to build up the solution to the original problem. It is typically implemented using iterative loops and a table to store intermediate results.
4. Initialize the dp table with zeros and set the base case dp[0][0] = 1.
5. Iterate through all possible numbers of vertices from 1 to N.
6. For each number of vertices, iterate through all possible numbers of good vertices.
7. For each combination of vertices and good vertices, apply the transition formula to update the dp table.
8. The final answer is the sum of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to N, modulo 998244353.
9. Consider edge cases such as the minimum and maximum values of N and d_i.
