1. State Expression: Define dp[i][j] as the number of ways to form a subtree with i vertices and j good vertices.
2. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1, indicating there's one way to form a subtree with one vertex (the root itself) which is also a good vertex.
3. Transition: For each vertex count i from 2 to N, and for each good vertex count j from 1 to i, calculate dp[i][j] by considering all possible ways to add a new vertex to the subtree. This involves iterating over all possible positions where the new vertex can be added and updating the dp table accordingly.
4. Ensure the out-degree constraints are satisfied during the transition step.
5. Final Computation: The answer will be the sum of dp[N][j] for all j, modulo 998244353.
6. Edge Cases: Ensure to handle cases where d[i] = 0 for all i except the root, as well as cases where d[i] = N-1 for some i.
