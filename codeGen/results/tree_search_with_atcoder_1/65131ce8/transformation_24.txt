2. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This method involves solving smaller subproblems first and using their solutions to build up the solution to the original problem. It is typically implemented using iterative loops and a table to store intermediate results.
3. State Expression: Define dp[i][j] as the number of ways to form a subtree with i vertices and j good vertices. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1, indicating there's one way to form a subtree with one vertex (the root itself) which is also a good vertex.
4. Transition: For each vertex i, calculate the number of ways to distribute its out-degree d_i among its children. Use combinatorial methods to determine the number of ways to partition the remaining vertices into the required subtrees.
5. Ensure that the sum of out-degrees of all subtrees rooted at each vertex matches the given sequence d.
6. Accumulate the number of good vertices for each subtree configuration that matches the given out-degree sequence.
7. Use modular arithmetic with modulus 998244353 to handle large numbers and avoid overflow.
8. Iterate through all possible subtree sizes and good vertex counts to fill the dp table.
9. Sum the values in the dp table that correspond to valid subtree configurations to get the final answer.
10. Output the sum of the numbers of good vertices for all good trees, modulo 998244353.
