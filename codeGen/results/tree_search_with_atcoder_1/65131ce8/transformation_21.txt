2. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This method involves solving smaller subproblems first and using their solutions to build up the solution to the original problem. It is typically implemented using iterative loops and a table to store intermediate results.
3. State Expression: Define dp[i][j] as the number of ways to form a subtree with i vertices and j good vertices. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1, indicating there's one way to form a subtree with one vertex (the root itself) which is also a good vertex.
4. Transition Relation: For each vertex, consider it as a root and partition the remaining vertices into subtrees. Use previously solved subproblems to determine the number of ways to distribute the vertices while maintaining the good vertex property.
5. Iterate through each possible number of vertices and good vertices, updating the dp table based on the defined transition relation.
6. Sum up the number of good vertices for all possible trees, considering the constraints and the modulo operation.
7. Handle edge cases such as when all vertices have zero out-degree except the root or when the out-degree distribution is highly skewed.
