===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
1. Define the problem in terms of Dynamic Programming.
2. Base Case: A 1x1 matrix with a single element is trivially valid, dp[1][1] = 1.
3. State: Define dp[i][j] as the number of valid matrices with i rows and j columns.
4. Transition:
   - For each element in the matrix, consider the constraints given in the problem.
   - Use the transition formula: dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1] - dp[i-1][j-1] + 998244353) % 998244353.
5. Iterate through all possible sizes of matrices from 1x1 up to NxM, filling in the dp table using the transition formula.
6. Output the value of dp[N][M] which represents the number of valid matrices for the given N and M.
7. Ensure to handle edge cases such as the smallest matrix sizes (e.g., 1x1, 1xM, Nx1).
8. Consider the modulo operation 998244353 to keep the numbers manageable and within the problem's constraints.
