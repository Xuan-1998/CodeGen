1. Define the problem in terms of Dynamic Programming (DP) by using a 2D DP table.
2. Base Case: The base case would be dp[1][1] = 2, as a 1x1 matrix can have either 0 or 1, both of which trivially satisfy the condition.
3. State: Define dp[i][j] as the number of valid i x j matrices. Initialize dp[0][j] = 1 and dp[i][0] = 1 for all i, j.
4. Transition: To derive dp[i][j], consider adding a row or column to a smaller valid matrix. For each new element added, ensure the condition A_{a, b} * A_{c, d} <= A_{a, d} * A_{c, b} is met for all quadruples (a, b, c, d).
5. Iterate over all possible matrix sizes from 1x1 to NxM, updating the DP table based on the transition rule.
6. Sum all dp[i][j] values to get the total number of valid matrices.
7. Return the result modulo 998244353.
8. Ensure to handle edge cases such as the smallest matrices (1x1) and matrices where N or M is 1.
