===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define the problem in terms of Dynamic Programming (DP). Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid matrices of size i x j that satisfy the given condition.
2. Initialize the DP table. The base case is dp[1][1] = 1, as a 1x1 matrix with a single element is always valid.
3. Transition: To fill dp[i][j], consider the following:
   - A valid matrix of size i x j can be formed by extending a valid matrix of size (i-1) x j by adding a new row, or by extending a valid matrix of size i x (j-1) by adding a new column.
   - Ensure that the new row or column maintains the given condition for all quadruples (a, b, c, d).
4. Iterate through all possible sizes of matrices from 1x1 up to NxM, filling the DP table using the transition rule.
5. The final answer will be the value of dp[N][M] modulo 998244353.
6. Edge cases to consider:
   - Smallest matrices (1x1, 1xN, Nx1).
   - Ensure that the DP transitions correctly handle the boundaries of the matrix.
