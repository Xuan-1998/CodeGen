1. Define the state: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid i x j matrices that satisfy the given condition.
2. Base Case: Initialize dp[1][1] = 1, as a 1x1 matrix with a single element (either 0 or 1) trivially satisfies the condition.
3. Transition: To compute dp[i][j], consider the addition of a row or column to a smaller valid matrix (i.e., dp[i-1][j] or dp[i][j-1]) and ensure the condition is met for the new elements. This involves checking the condition for all relevant quadruples (a, b, c, d) in the new matrix.
4. Recursion with memoization: Use a recursive function with memoization to compute dp[i][j] by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.
5. Modulo operation: Since the result needs to be modulo 998244353, ensure that all operations involving dp values are taken modulo 998244353.
6. Final computation: Compute the result for dp[N][M] using the recursive function and print the result.
7. Edge cases: Consider edge cases such as the smallest matrix (1x1) and matrices with one dimension being 1 (e.g., 1xM or Nx1), which should be handled by the base case and transition logic.
