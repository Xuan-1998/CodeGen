1. Define the problem in terms of Dynamic Programming (DP). Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid matrices of size i x j that satisfy the given condition.
2. Initialize the base case: dp[1][1] = 2, since a 1x1 matrix can either be [0] or [1].
3. Iterate over all possible sizes of matrices from 1x1 to NxM:
   - For each matrix size i x j, consider the placement of the element at position (i, j).
   - Ensure that the placement of the element at (i, j) maintains the condition A_{a, b} * A_{c, d} <= A_{a, d} * A_{c, b} for all valid (a, b, c, d).
4. Use nested loops to fill the dp table:
   - For each element (i, j), iterate over all previous rows and columns to ensure the condition is satisfied.
   - Update dp[i][j] based on valid placements.
5. Use modulo 998244353 to keep the values within the required range.
6. After filling the dp table, the final answer will be stored in dp[N][M].
