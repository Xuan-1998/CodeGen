===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define the Dynamic Programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the count of valid matrices of size `i x j` that satisfy the given condition.
2. Initialize the base case: `dp[1][1] = 2`, as a 1x1 matrix can either be [0] or [1], both trivially satisfying the condition.
3. For each matrix size `i` from 1 to N and `j` from 1 to M:
    a. Iterate over all possible placements of elements in the (i, j) position.
    b. Ensure that the condition `A[a, b] * A[c, d] <= A[a, d] * A[c, b]` is satisfied for all `1 <= a < c <= i` and `1 <= b < d <= j`.
    c. If the condition is satisfied, update the count in `dp[i][j]` by considering the valid configurations of smaller matrices.
4. Use memoization to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
5. Return `dp[N][M] % 998244353` as the final result.

Edge cases:
- Smallest matrix sizes (1x1, 1xN, Nx1) should be handled explicitly in the base case.
- Ensure that the modulo operation is applied correctly to avoid overflow issues.
