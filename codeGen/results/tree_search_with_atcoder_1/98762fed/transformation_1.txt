1. Define the state dp[i][j] to represent the number of valid matrices of size i x j.
2. Initialize dp[1][1] to 2, as there are two possible 1x1 matrices: [0] and [1], both of which trivially satisfy the condition.
3. Iterate over the dimensions of the matrix from 1 to N for rows and 1 to M for columns.
4. For each subproblem defined by (i, j), calculate the number of valid matrices by considering the addition of a new row or column to the previously computed subproblems.
5. Ensure that the condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} is satisfied for all quadruples (a, b, c, d) by verifying the condition for each possible value of the new elements added.
6. Use memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
7. After filling the dp table, the value dp[N][M] will be the answer to the problem.
8. Return dp[N][M] modulo 998244353.
