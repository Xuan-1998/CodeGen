1. Define the state expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid matrices of size i x j that satisfy the given condition.
2. Initialization: Initialize dp[1][1] to 1 since a 1x1 matrix can only have one configuration (either 0 or 1).
3. Transition: Compute dp[i][j] by considering the valid configurations from dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1] while ensuring the condition A_{a, b} * A_{c, d} <= A_{a, d} * A_{c, b} is met for all 1 ≤ a < c ≤ i and 1 ≤ b < d ≤ j.
4. Iterate through the matrix dimensions from 1 to N for rows and 1 to M for columns, updating the dp table based on the transition rule.
5. The final answer will be the value in dp[N][M] modulo 998244353.
6. Edge cases: Consider the smallest matrix sizes (1x1) and ensure that the solution handles the maximum constraints efficiently.
