===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
1. Define the problem in terms of Dynamic Programming where dp[i][j] represents the number of valid matrices of size i x j that satisfy the given condition.
2. Initialize the base cases: dp[1][1] = 2, since a 1x1 matrix can either be [0] or [1].
3. Use a bottom-up approach to fill the dp table:
   a. Iterate over i from 1 to N.
   b. Iterate over j from 1 to M.
   c. For each cell dp[i][j], calculate its value based on the previously computed values in dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1], ensuring that new rows and columns added do not violate the matrix condition.
4. The transition formula needs to ensure that any new row or column added maintains the inequality A[a, b] * A[c, d] <= A[a, d] * A[c, b] for all valid (a, b, c, d) pairs.
5. The final answer will be dp[N][M] % 998244353.
6. Consider edge cases where N or M is 1, as the condition will always hold true for any 1-dimensional matrix.
