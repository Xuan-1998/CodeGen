1. Problem Understanding: We need to count the number of valid N x M matrices where each element is either 0 or 1, and the matrices satisfy the condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} for every quadruple of integers (a, b, c, d) such that 1 \leq a < c \leq N and 1 \leq b < d \leq M.
2. Key Insight: The condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} implies that the matrix must be sorted both row-wise and column-wise. This means that each row and each column should be non-decreasing.
3. Dynamic Programming Approach:
   a. Define dp[i][j] as the number of valid matrices of size i x j.
   b. Base Case: dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 1 for all i, j because an empty matrix or a matrix with zero rows or columns is trivially valid.
   c. Transition: To construct dp[i][j], consider adding a new row or column to a smaller valid matrix and ensure that the new row or column maintains the non-decreasing order.
4. Counting Valid Matrices:
   a. For each size (i, j), iterate through all possible values for the new row or column and check if adding them maintains the non-decreasing order.
   b. Update dp[i][j] based on the valid configurations.
5. Modulo Operation: Since the number of valid matrices can be very large, take the result modulo 998244353 at each step to prevent overflow.
6. Edge Cases: Consider the smallest matrices (1x1, 1xN, Nx1) and ensure the solution handles them correctly.
7. Final Answer: The value dp[N][M] will give the number of valid N x M matrices.
