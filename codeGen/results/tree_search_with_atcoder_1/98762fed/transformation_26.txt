===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid matrices of size i x j. 
2. Transition: The transition needs to be carefully designed to ensure that the condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} is satisfied for all (a, b, c, d) such that 1 \leq a < c \leq N and 1 \leq b < d \leq M.
3. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1, since a 1x1 matrix with a single element is trivially valid.
4. Recurrence Relation: To find dp[i][j], consider the number of ways to form a valid i x j matrix by adding a row or a column to smaller matrices. The exact recurrence relation needs to be derived based on the condition given in the problem statement. 
5. Initialize the dp table with the base case.
6. Iterate over the dimensions of the matrix from smaller to larger, updating the dp table using the recurrence relation.
7. The final answer will be dp[N][M] % 998244353.
8. Edge Cases: Consider the smallest matrices (1x1, 1x2, 2x1) and ensure the recurrence relation handles these correctly.
