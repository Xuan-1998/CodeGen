===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
1. Dynamic Programming Approach:
   - Use a 2D DP table, dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the number of valid matrices of size i x j.
   - Initialize dp[1][1] = 2 since a 1x1 matrix can either have a 0 or a 1.

2. State Transition:
   - For each i from 1 to N and each j from 1 to M, compute dp[i][j] based on previous states.
   - Ensure that the condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} is maintained when adding a new row or column.
   - Iterate through all possible values for the elements in the new row or column and check the given condition to update dp[i][j].

3. Modulo Operation:
   - As the number of matrices can be very large, take modulo 998244353 at each step to avoid overflow and ensure the result fits within standard data types.

4. Base Case:
   - Initialize dp[1][1] = 2 since a 1x1 matrix can either have a 0 or a 1.

5. Edge Cases:
   - Consider edge cases where N or M is 1, which simplifies the problem to a single row or column matrix.
   - Ensure the DP table is correctly initialized to handle these cases.

6. Final Output:
   - The final answer will be dp[N][M] % 998244353, representing the number of valid matrices of size NxM.
