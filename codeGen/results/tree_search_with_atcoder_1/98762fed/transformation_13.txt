===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define the problem in terms of Dynamic Programming (DP).
2. State: Let dp[i][j] denote the count of valid matrices of size i x j.
3. Base Case: Initialize dp[i][0] = dp[0][j] = 1 for all i, j, as matrices with 0 columns or rows trivially satisfy the condition.
4. Transition: For each cell (i, j), iterate over all possible placements of elements in the (i, j) position and ensure all conditions are satisfied with respect to previous elements.
5. Ensure that the condition A[a, b] * A[c, d] <= A[a, d] * A[c, b] is maintained for all 1 <= a < c <= N and 1 <= b < d <= M.
6. Use memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
7. Compute the result by iterating over all possible matrix sizes and summing up the valid counts modulo 998244353.
8. Return the final result.
