1. Define the problem in terms of dynamic programming where dp[i][j] represents the number of valid matrices of size i x j.

2. Base Case: The base case would be dp[1][1] = 2, as a 1x1 matrix can have either 0 or 1, both trivially satisfying the condition.

3. State Transition: To fill dp[i][j], consider extending smaller matrices by adding a new row or column and ensuring the condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} holds for the new elements added. This involves iterating over all possible positions of the new row or column and checking the condition for all relevant quadruples.

4. Iterate through all possible sizes of matrices from 1x1 to NxM, using the state transition to fill the dp table.

5. Use modulo 998244353 to ensure the results do not overflow and fit within the required constraints.

6. The final answer will be stored in dp[N][M], representing the number of valid matrices of size NxM.

7. Edge Cases: Ensure the solution handles the smallest input sizes (N=1, M=1) correctly and efficiently.
