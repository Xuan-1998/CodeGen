1. Define the problem in terms of dynamic programming. Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid matrices of size i x j that satisfy the given condition.

2. Initialize the base cases for the dp table. For a 1x1 matrix, all matrices are valid, so dp[1][1] = 1.

3. Use a nested loop to fill in the dp table from the base cases up to the desired size N x M. Iterate over all possible matrix sizes i and j.

4. For each matrix size i x j, consider the addition of a new row or column. Ensure that the condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} is maintained for all quadruples (a, b, c, d).

5. To maintain the condition, observe that if a new row is added, it must be consistent with all previous rows. Similarly, if a new column is added, it must be consistent with all previous columns.

6. Use the transition relationships:
   - dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] * number of valid ways to add a new row to an i-1 x j matrix
   - dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] * number of valid ways to add a new column to an i x j-1 matrix

7. Ensure that the transitions do not double-count the matrices. Use a modulo operation with 998244353 to keep the numbers manageable.

8. After filling in the dp table, the value dp[N][M] will contain the number of valid matrices of size N x M.

9. Print the result dp[N][M] % 998244353.

10. Consider edge cases such as the smallest matrix sizes (N=1, M=1) and larger sizes near the constraints (N=400, M=400).
