2. Bottom-Up Strategy with Tabulation: This approach builds up the solution by solving all subproblems starting from the smallest ones and combining their solutions to solve larger problems. It uses a table to store the results of subproblems. Time complexity: O(N^2), space complexity: O(N^2) due to the table used for storing intermediate results.
Base Case: Initialize dp[0][0] = 1, which represents an empty sequence. For all other dp[0][j] where j > 0, initialize dp[0][j] = 0.
Transition: For each i from 1 to N and for each j from 1 to N, update dp[i][j] using the relation dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j-1] + dp[i-1][j-1] * A[j-1]) % 998244353.
1. Tabulation: This approach involves filling up a table (dp array) where each entry dp[i][j] represents the number of valid sequences of length i using the first j numbers. Time complexity: O(N^2), space complexity: O(N^2) due to the table used.
Edge Cases: Consider cases where N is at its minimum (1) and maximum (500). Also consider cases where all A_i are equal to 1 or N.
