1. Top-Down Approach with Memoization: This approach uses recursion and stores the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. It helps in breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and solving them efficiently. Time complexity: O(N^3), space complexity: O(N^2) due to the memoization table.
State Expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid sequences of length i where the last element is j. The transition will involve summing over all possible previous elements that can lead to a valid sequence.
2. Transition Relationship: dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k] for all k such that k occurs at most A[k-1] times in the sequence and j occurs at most A[j-1] times). We also need to ensure that the total count of each element in the sequence is within the limit specified by A.
3. Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming (Tabulation): This approach builds up the solution iteratively from the base cases using a table to store intermediate results. Time complexity: O(N^3), space complexity: O(N^2) due to the DP table.
4. Initialize the base case: dp[1][j] = 1 for all j from 1 to N since any single element sequence is valid.
5. Iterate over the length of the sequence from 2 to N, and for each length, iterate over the possible last element values from 1 to N. For each combination, calculate the number of valid sequences using the transition relationship.
6. Sum up the values of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to N to get the total number of valid sequences of length N.
7. Return the result modulo 998244353.
8. Ensure to handle edge cases where N=1 or all A[i] are 1.
