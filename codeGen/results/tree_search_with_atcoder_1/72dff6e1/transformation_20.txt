===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define the state dp[i][j] as the number of valid sequences of length i where the last element is j, and the number of occurrences of each integer k (1 <= k <= i) is at most A_k.
2. Initialize the dp table with dimensions (N+1) x (N+1) with all values set to 0.
3. Base case: For sequences of length 1, dp[1][j] = 1 for all 1 <= j <= N, as each integer can appear exactly once.
4. Transition: For each length i from 2 to N, and for each possible last element j from 1 to N:
   - Compute dp[i][j] by summing over all valid previous states dp[i-1][k] where k ranges from 1 to N, ensuring that the constraints are satisfied.
   - Specifically, dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k] for all k such that the number of occurrences of j in the sequence does not exceed A_j).
5. Sum up all dp[N][j] for j from 1 to N to get the total number of valid sequences of length N.
6. Return the result modulo 998244353.
