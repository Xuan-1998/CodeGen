===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to form a sequence of length i where the last element is j, and the sequence is valid according to the given constraints.
2. Initialize the dp array:
   - dp[1][j] = 1 for all j from 1 to N because any single element sequence is valid.
3. Iterate over the length of the sequence from 2 to N:
   - For each length i, iterate over the possible last elements j from 1 to N:
     - For each possible previous element k from 1 to N, check if adding j to the sequence does not violate the constraints:
       - Ensure that the number of occurrences of j in the sequence is at most A[j].
       - Ensure that the number of occurrences of k in the sequence is at most A[k].
     - If the conditions are satisfied, update dp[i][j] by adding dp[i-1][k] to it.
4. The final answer is the sum of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to N modulo 998244353.
5. Handle edge cases:
   - When N = 1, the answer is always 1 because there is only one possible sequence.
   - Ensure that the constraints 1 <= A_i <= N are always respected during the updates.
