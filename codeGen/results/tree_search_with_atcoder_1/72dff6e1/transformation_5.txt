1. Define the problem in terms of Dynamic Programming.
   - Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid sequences of length i where the last element is j.
   - The transition will involve summing over all possible previous elements that can lead to a valid sequence.

2. Initialization:
   - Initialize dp[1][j] = 1 for all j from 1 to N, since a single element sequence is always valid if it satisfies the constraints.

3. Transition:
   - For each length i from 2 to N:
     - For each element j from 1 to N:
       - Compute dp[i][j] by summing dp[i-1][k] for all k from 1 to N such that k and j satisfy the constraints given by A.

4. Constraints:
   - Ensure that the number of occurrences of i in B is at most A[i].
   - Ensure that the number of occurrences of B[i] in B is at most A[B[i]].

5. Result:
   - The final result will be the sum of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to N, representing all valid sequences of length N.

6. Edge Cases:
   - Handle edge cases where N = 1 or all A[i] = 1.
   - Ensure the solution works within the given constraints of 1 ≤ N ≤ 500 and 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ N.

7. Modulo Operation:
   - Since the result needs to be modulo 998244353, ensure all calculations are done modulo 998244353 to avoid overflow and meet the problem requirements.
