2. Bottom-Up Strategy with Tabulation: This approach builds up the solution by solving all subproblems starting from the smallest ones and combining their solutions to solve larger problems. It uses a table to store the results of subproblems. Time complexity: O(N^3), space complexity: O(N^2) due to the table used for storing intermediate results.

State Expression: Let dp[i][j] be the number of valid sequences of length i where the last element is j, and the sequence is valid according to the given constraints.

Initialization: dp[0][0] = 1, representing an empty sequence.

Transition: For each i from 1 to N and for each j from 1 to N:
- dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k]) for all k where adding j to the sequence does not violate the constraints.

Final Answer: The final answer will be the sum of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to N, modulo 998244353.
