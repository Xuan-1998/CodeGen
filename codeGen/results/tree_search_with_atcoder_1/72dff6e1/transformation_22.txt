===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define the problem using Dynamic Programming with a Bottom-Up Strategy with Tabulation. This approach builds up the solution by solving all subproblems starting from the smallest ones and combining their solutions to solve larger problems. It uses a table to store the results of subproblems. Time complexity: O(N^2), space complexity: O(N^2) due to the table used for storing intermediate results.

2. State Expression: Let dp[i][j] be the number of valid sequences of length i where the last element of the sequence is j. This state ensures that the constraints are satisfied for the sequence length i and the last element j.

3. Initialization: Initialize dp[0][0] = 1, as there's one way to have an empty sequence.

4. Transition: For each i from 1 to N, and for each j from 1 to N:
   - Compute dp[i][j] based on previous states dp[i-1][k] for all valid k, ensuring that the constraints are satisfied.
   - Specifically, if the current element j can be added to the sequence ending in k without violating the constraints, then dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][k].

5. Final Answer: The answer will be the sum of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to N, modulo 998244353.

6. Edge Cases: Handle the case where N = 1 separately, as the sequence length is minimal and straightforward to compute.
