1. Define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to form a sequence of length i using the first j numbers.
2. Initialize the base case: dp[0][j] = 1 for all j from 0 to N, representing that there is exactly one way to form an empty sequence.
3. Iterate over the length of the sequence i from 1 to N.
4. For each i, iterate over the first j numbers from 1 to N.
5. For each dp[i][j], calculate the value as follows:
   a. dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] (ways to form a sequence of length i without using the j-th number).
   b. If j > 0 and A[j-1] >= i, add dp[i-1][j-1] to dp[i][j] (ways to form a sequence of length i by using the j-th number, considering the constraints).
6. Apply modulo 998244353 to each dp[i][j] to ensure the values do not overflow.
7. The final answer will be dp[N][N], representing the number of ways to form a sequence of length N using the first N numbers.
