1. Define the State: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid sequences of length i where the last element is j. The transition will involve summing over all possible previous elements that can lead to a valid sequence.
2. Transition: For each dp[i][j], sum up dp[i-1][k] for all k from 1 to N where k != j and the count of j in the sequence is within the limit specified by A[j]. Ensure that the count of each element in the sequence does not exceed its corresponding value in A.
3. Initialization: dp[1][j] = 1 for all j from 1 to N, since a single element sequence is always valid if it satisfies the constraints.
4. Iteration: Iterate through the lengths of sequences from 2 to N. For each length, and for each possible last element of the sequence, calculate the number of valid sequences using the transition rule.
5. Result: The result will be the sum of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to N, modulo 998244353.
6. Edge Cases: Consider the smallest value of N (N=1) and the constraints on A (A_i = 1).
