1. Define a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of valid sequences of length `i` ending with number `j`.
2. Initialize the base case: `dp[0][j] = 1` for all `j` from 1 to N, representing that there is exactly one way to form an empty sequence.
3. Iterate over the length of the sequence from 1 to N.
4. For each length `i`, iterate over each possible ending number `j` from 1 to N.
5. For each `j`, calculate `dp[i][j]` as the sum of `dp[i-1][k]` for all `k` such that `k != j` and the number of occurrences of `k` in the sequence is within the limit specified by `A[k-1]`.
6. Use a memoization table to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
7. The final answer will be the sum of `dp[N][j]` for all `j` from 1 to N, modulo 998244353.
