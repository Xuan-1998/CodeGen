2. Bottom-Up Strategy with Tabulation: This approach builds up the solution by solving all subproblems starting from the smallest ones and combining their solutions to solve larger problems. It uses a table to store the results of subproblems. Time complexity: O(N^3), space complexity: O(N^2) due to the table used for storing intermediate results.

State Expression: Let dp[i][j] be the number of valid sequences of length i where the last element of the sequence is j.

Initialization: 
- dp[1][j] = 1 for all 1 <= j <= N, because there is exactly one valid sequence of length 1 for each value of j.

Transition: 
- For each i from 2 to N:
  - For each j from 1 to N:
    - dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k] for all k from 1 to N if the number of occurrences of k in the sequence is at most A_k and the number of occurrences of j in the sequence is at most A_j)

Result Computation:
- The final result is the sum of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to N, taken modulo 998244353.

Edge Cases:
- Handle the case when N = 1 separately.
- Ensure that the constraints on the number of occurrences are properly checked during the transition.

Overall Plan:
1. Initialize the dp table.
2. Populate the dp table using the defined transitions.
3. Compute the final result by summing up appropriate values from the dp table.
4. Return the result modulo 998244353.
