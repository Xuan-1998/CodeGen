1. Bottom-Up Approach with Tabulation:
   - Initialize a DP table dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of valid sequences of length i ending with number j.
   - Base Case: dp[0][j] = 1 for all j in 1 to N, representing that there is exactly one way to form an empty sequence.
   - State Transition: 
     - For each length i from 1 to N:
       - For each number j from 1 to N:
         - dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k] for all k from 1 to N such that k != j and k <= A[j-1]).
   - The final answer will be the sum of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to N.

2. Edge Cases:
   - When N = 1, ensure that the solution handles the smallest input size correctly.
   - When all A_i are equal to N, ensure that the solution handles cases where all elements can appear N times.

3. Time Complexity: O(N^3), due to the nested loops for filling the DP table.
4. Space Complexity: O(N^2), due to the storage required for the DP table.
