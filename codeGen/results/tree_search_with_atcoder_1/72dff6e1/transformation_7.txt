1. Define a dynamic programming table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of valid sequences of length i where the last element is j.
2. Initialize the table: dp[1][j] = 1 for all j from 1 to N, since a single element sequence is always valid if it satisfies the constraints.
3. Define the recurrence relation: For each length i from 2 to N and each element j from 1 to N, dp[i][j] is the sum of dp[i-1][k] for all k from 1 to N where the sequence remains valid under the given constraints.
4. Ensure that the constraints are satisfied: For each element j, the number of occurrences in the sequence should not exceed A[j]. Maintain an additional array count[j] to keep track of occurrences of each element in the sequence.
5. Use a nested loop to iterate over the lengths and elements, updating the dp table according to the recurrence relation and constraints.
6. After filling the dp table, the result will be the sum of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to N, taken modulo 998244353.
7. Handle edge cases where N is 1 or all A[i] are 1.
