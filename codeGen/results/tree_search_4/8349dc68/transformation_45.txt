===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has a greedy property. If so, consider using a greedy algorithm with dynamic programming to solve the problem.

Let's analyze the given constraints:
- The length of the input array is at most 500
- Each element of the array is an integer between 0 and 10^9
- The value of k is between 1 and the length of the array

Considering these constraints, we can conclude that a greedy approach might not be suitable due to the presence of large values in the array. However, dynamic programming could still be used.

To define the maximum sum of a subarray ending at index i as the state, considering only the current subarray and previously computed states.
Let's consider a state dp[i] representing the maximum sum of the subarray ending at index i. We can update this state based on the maximum values of previous subarrays.

Consider the maximum value in each subarray as the state. The transition relationship can be formulated by updating the maximum sum of the current subarray based on the maximum values of the previous subarrays.
Let's formulate a recursive function with memoization to efficiently calculate the maximum sum of each subarray.
