===BEGIN PLAN===
View dp[i][k] as the maximum sum that can be achieved by partitioning the subarray from index i to i+k.

Define dp[i][k] as the maximum value that can be achieved by partitioning the array from index 0 to i+k.
Use a 1D dynamic programming table with length n+1, where dp[i] represents the maximum sum that can be achieved by partitioning the array from index 0 to i.

The state transition would consider the maximum value among this subarray and its previous maximum values. 

Transition function: 
dp[i][k] = max(dp[i-1][j] + arr[i+j], dp[i-k][k])

Base case:
dp[0][k] = arr[0]

Bottom-up approach:

For i from 1 to n, 
    For k from 1 to min(i, k), 
        dp[i][k] = max(dp[i-1][j] + arr[i+j], dp[i-k][k])

Final answer: return dp[n][k]
