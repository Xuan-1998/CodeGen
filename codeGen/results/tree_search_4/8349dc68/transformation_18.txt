===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the maximum value of each subarray as a state, and use memoization to store the maximum sum for each prefix. Then, dynamically calculate the maximum sum for each subarray by considering the maximum value of the previous subarray.

Let state(i, j) be the maximum sum of arr[i-j:i], where i is the end index and j is the length of a subarray. Base case: state(i, j) = max(arr[i-j:i]) if i - j <= k

Consider state as (i, j) where i is the end index of the current subarray and j is its length. Define a function f(i, j) that returns the maximum sum for arr[i-j:i]. The transition relationship would be: f(i, j) = max(arr[i-j:i]) + dp[i-1][j-1] if i - j <= k

Use dynamic programming to build up a 2D table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of subarrays with length j ending at index i.

For each cell dp[i][j], calculate it as: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k-1] + arr[i-k+1:i+1]) for k in range(1, min(j+1, i-k+2)), where the maximum is taken over all possible choices of k.

Finally, return dp[n-1][k-1] as the maximum sum.
