===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the maximum value of each subarray as a state, and use memoization to store the maximum sum for each prefix. Then, dynamically calculate the maximum sum for each subarray by considering the maximum value of the previous subarray.

dp[i] = max(dp[j-1] + max(arr[j-k+1:j]), 0) for j from k to n, where dp[0] = 0 and dp[i] < 0 for i > 0

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming where the state represents the current window's maximum value, and the transition is calculated based on the maximum values of the previous windows.

Dynamic calculation of the maximum sum for each subarray by considering the maximum value of the previous subarray:

1. Initialize dp[0] to 0
2. Iterate through j from k to n:
   a. Calculate max_value = max(arr[j-k+1:j])
   b. Update dp[i] = max(dp[j-1] + max_value, 0)
3. Return the maximum sum in dp[]
