Determine if the problem has an optimal substructure property. If so, consider using dynamic programming with memoization to solve the problem.

To define the state, consider the maximum sum of a subarray ending at index i. The state can be defined as a tuple (max_sum, max_val) where max_sum is the maximum sum and max_val is the maximum value encountered so far in the subarray.

The transition relationship can be formulated by updating this state considering the current subarray. For each subarray of length k ending at index i, calculate the maximum sum and maximum value as follows:

* If the current subarray has a maximum value greater than or equal to the previous maximum value (max_val), update max_sum by adding the maximum value and update max_val.
* If the current subarray has a maximum value less than the previous maximum value, keep max_sum and max_val unchanged.

Use top-down dynamic programming with memoization to recursively calculate the maximum sum of each subarray and store the results in a dictionary for efficient retrieval. The base case is when the length of the subarray is less than or equal to k.
