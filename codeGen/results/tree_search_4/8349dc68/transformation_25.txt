===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the maximum value of each subarray as a state, and use memoization to store the maximum sum for each prefix. Then, dynamically calculate the maximum sum for each subarray by considering the maximum value of the previous subarray.

let state(i, j) be the maximum sum of arr[i-j:i], where i is the end index and j is the length of a subarray. base case: state(i, j) = max(arr[i-j:i]) if i - j <= k

Consider state as (i, j, max_sum) where i is the end index of the current subarray, j is its length, and max_sum is the maximum sum for arr[:i]. Define a function f(i, j, max_sum) that returns the maximum sum for arr[i-j:i]. The transition relationship would be: f(i, j, max_sum) = max(arr[i-j:i]) + max_sum if i - j <= k

Define a dictionary d where d[(i, j)] is the maximum sum for subarray arr[i-j:i] of length j.

Initialize d as an empty dictionary.

For each (i, j) in range(1, n+1) * range(1, min(i, k)+1), calculate f(i, j, max_sum) and store it in d. Use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

The maximum sum for the entire array would be the maximum value of f(i, j, max_sum) over all (i, j).
