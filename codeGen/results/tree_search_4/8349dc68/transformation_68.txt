===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has an optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems. If so, consider using dynamic programming with memoization to solve the problem.

To consider the maximum sum of all possible partitions of the array into k contiguous subarrays as the state, with base case being when k is 1 or the array length is less than or equal to k.

The transition relationship can be defined as the maximum sum of the current subarray plus the maximum sum of all possible partitions of the remaining array into k-1 contiguous subarrays. If k is 1, consider it as a base case and return the maximum value in the current subarray.

Apply memoization by creating a 2D array to store the cumulative maximum sums and iterate backwards to find the maximum sum for each subproblem. Initialize the memoized values with -âˆž for all states that have not been computed yet.
