Determine if the problem has a greedy property. If so, consider using a greedy algorithm with dynamic programming to solve the problem.

Initially, it seems that there is no greedy property in this problem, as we need to find the maximum sum among all possible partitions of the array into k contiguous subarrays. Therefore, we can't use a straightforward greedy approach.

To consider the maximum sum of all possible partitions of the array into k contiguous subarrays as the state, with base case being when k is 1.
This step seems reasonable, as we want to find the maximum sum among all possible partitions of the array. The base case would be when there's only one partition, which is trivial.

The transition relationship can be modified to consider the effect of changing the values of each subarray to become the maximum value of that subarray.
This step seems correct, as we need to take into account how changing the values of each subarray affects the overall sum.

You could implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by iterating from k to 1 and filling up the dp array with the maximum sum for each partition.
This approach is reasonable, as we can start with the base case (k = 1) and recursively calculate the maximum sum for larger values of k. The time complexity would be O(n * k), where n is the length of the array.

However, we should also consider edge cases, such as when k is equal to the length of the array. In this case, there's only one partition, which simplifies the problem significantly.
