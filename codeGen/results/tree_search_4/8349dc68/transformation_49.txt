Determine if the problem has a greedy property. If so, consider using a greedy algorithm with dynamic programming to solve the problem.

To define the maximum sum of a subarray ending at index i as the state, considering only the current subarray and previously computed states.

The state can be defined as a tuple (max_sum, max_val), where max_sum is the maximum sum encountered so far, and max_val is the maximum value encountered so far in this subarray. The transition relationship can be formulated by updating this state based on the current subarray.

Consider implementing a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation, where you iterate through the array and update a table dp[i] as follows:
  - If i < k, set dp[i] to (arr[0], arr[0]) because all elements in the first k elements are considered.
  - For each index j from k to n-1:
    - Calculate max_val as the maximum value of the subarray ending at j. It's either arr[j] or the previous max_val.
    - Calculate new_max_sum as the sum of max_val and the maximum sum of the subarray ending at j-k (i.e., dp[j-k]).
    - Update dp[j] to be min(dp[j-1], new_max_sum, (arr[j], arr[j])) based on whether we should consider this current element in the subarray or not.

Finally, return dp[n-1][0] as the maximum sum of the given array after partitioning.
