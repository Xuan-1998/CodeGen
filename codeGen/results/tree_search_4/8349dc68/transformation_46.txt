===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has an optimal substructure. If so, consider using dynamic programming to solve the problem.

The given array can be partitioned into contiguous subarrays of length at most k. For each subarray, calculate its maximum value and update the cumulative sum accordingly.

Define the state dp[i] as the maximum sum of the array up to index i. The transition relationship is based on comparing the current element with its corresponding maximum value in the previous subarray.

Fill a dynamic programming table (dp) where dp[i] represents the maximum sum of the array up to index i. Initialize dp[0] as the first element of the array, and then for each index i:

- If i is not a multiple of k, consider all possible partitions ending at i.
- For each partition, calculate its maximum value and update dp[i].
- Otherwise (i.e., i is a multiple of k), simply update dp[i] as the previous maximum sum plus the current element.

The final answer is dp[n - 1], which represents the largest sum of the given array after partitioning.
