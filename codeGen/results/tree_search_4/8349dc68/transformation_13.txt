===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the maximum value of each subarray as a state, and use memoization to store the maximum sum for each prefix. Then, dynamically calculate the maximum sum for each subarray by considering the maximum value of the previous subarray.

dp[i] = max(dp[j-1] + max(arr[j-k+1:j]), 0) for j from k to n, where dp[0] = 0 and dp[i] < 0 for i > 0

The plan is correct in terms of using dynamic programming to solve the problem. However, there are some potential issues:

* The transition function dp[i] = max(dp[j-1] + max(arr[j-k+1:j]), 0) assumes that the maximum value of the previous subarray can be directly added to the current subarray's maximum value. This might not always be true.
* There is no explicit consideration of the edge cases where k > i or j < k.

To improve the plan, consider the following:

* Instead of using a transition function based on the maximum values of the previous windows, use a more precise calculation that takes into account the actual subarray sums.
* Handle the edge cases explicitly by considering the scenarios where k > i or j < k.

Here is an updated version of the detailed plan:
