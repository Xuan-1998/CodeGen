===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the maximum value of each subarray as a state, and use memoization to store the maximum sum for each prefix. Then, dynamically calculate the maximum sum for each subarray by considering the maximum value of the previous subarray.

let state(i, j) be the maximum sum of arr[i-j:i], where i is the end index and j is the length of a subarray. base case: state(i, j) = max(arr[i-j:i]) if i - j <= k

Consider state as (i, j) where i is the end index of the current subarray and j is its length. Define a function f(i, j) that returns the maximum sum for arr[i-j:i]. The transition relationship would be: f(i, j) = max(arr[i-j:i]) + f(i-1, min(j, k)) if i - j > k

Memoize the function f(i, j) using a dictionary, where the key is (i, j) and the value is the maximum sum for arr[i-j:i].

The plan seems correct in general. However, there are some potential issues that need to be addressed:

1. The base case should be checked before calculating the maximum sum for the subarray.
2. The function f(i, j) should return the maximum sum for arr[i-j:i] if i - j <= k, and f(i-1, min(j, k)) otherwise.

The plan does not include edge cases, such as when k is equal to 1 or the length of the array. These cases should be handled separately.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
