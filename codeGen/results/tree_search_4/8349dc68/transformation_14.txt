===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the maximum value of each subarray as a state, and use memoization to store the maximum sum for each prefix. Then, dynamically calculate the maximum sum for each subarray by considering the maximum value of the previous subarray.

dp[i] = max(dp[j-1] + max(arr[j-k+1:j]), 0) for j from k to n, where dp[0] = 0 and dp[i] < 0 for i > 0

Use a sliding window approach to keep track of the maximum sum of the current window, and update it accordingly as you slide through the array.

Create a dictionary dp where dp[i] is the maximum sum for the first i elements, and use memoization to store the results.
