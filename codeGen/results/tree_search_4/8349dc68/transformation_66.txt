===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has an optimal substructure property. If so, consider using dynamic programming to solve the problem.

Consider the maximum sum of all possible partitions of the array into k contiguous subarrays as the state, with base case being when k is 1.
The transition relationship can be defined as the maximum sum of the current subarray plus the maximum sum of all possible partitions of the remaining array into k-1 contiguous subarrays.

Use dynamic programming to create a 2D table where each cell represents the maximum sum of the given array after partitioning, considering the current subarray length as the state variable.
The table can be initialized with values from the base case (k=1).

To further optimize the problem, consider using a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of each subarray.
