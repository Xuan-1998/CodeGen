===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has an optimal substructure property and if the problem allows for memoization. If so, consider using dynamic programming with memoization to solve the problem.

To define the state, let dp[i] be the maximum sum that can be obtained by partitioning the array up to index i. The state transition equation will depend on the value of the current element at index i and the maximum sum of the subarray ending at index i-1.

Define dp[0] as the first element in the array. Then, for each i from 1 to n-1, calculate dp[i] based on whether including or excluding the current element gives a larger maximum sum. If the current element is less than or equal to the maximum value of its subarray, include it; otherwise, exclude it.

Implement memoization using a dictionary where each key is an index in the array and its corresponding value is the maximum sum that can be obtained by partitioning the array up to that index.

The optimal solution will be the last element in dp[], which corresponds to the entire array.
