===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has an optimal substructure property. If so, consider using dynamic programming with memoization to solve the problem. For example, partition the array into subarrays based on their maximum values, and recursively calculate the maximum sum of each subarray.

To consider the maximum sum of all possible partitions of the array into k contiguous subarrays as the state, with base case being when k is 1.

The state can be represented as a dictionary where the key is the current subarray index and the value is the maximum sum. Initialize a dictionary dp as the memoization table, where dp[i][j] stores the maximum sum after partitioning the first i elements into j subarrays.

For each element in the array, calculate the maximum sum by considering all possible partitions of the previous k-1 elements into k-1 contiguous subarrays. Update dp[i][j] with the maximum value calculated above.

Finally, return dp[n][k], which represents the maximum sum after partitioning the entire array into k contiguous subarrays.
