===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the maximum value of each subarray as a state, and use memoization to store the maximum sum for each prefix. Then, dynamically calculate the maximum sum for each subarray by considering the maximum value of the previous subarray.

dp[i] represents the maximum sum of arr[:i], where i is the length of a subarray.
DP state: dp[i] = max_sum(arr[:i]), where dp[i-1] represents the maximum sum of the previous subarray, and dp[0] is a base case for an empty array.

Use memoization to avoid redundant calculations. Initialize a dictionary memo with default value 0.

Define a recursive function dfs(i) that returns the maximum sum of arr[:i]. If i > k, return dp[i-k], where dp[i-k] is the maximum sum of the subarray ending at index i-k. Otherwise, update dp[i] as the maximum of:
    * The current element plus the maximum sum of the previous subarray (dp[i-1])
    * The current element

Memoize the result in memo.

Return memo[0], which represents the maximum sum of the entire array.
