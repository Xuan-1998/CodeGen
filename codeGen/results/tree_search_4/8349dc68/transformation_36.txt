To further refine and solidify our intuition about the problem, let's consider the following steps:

* Initialize a 2D table dp where dp[i][k] represents the maximum sum that can be achieved by partitioning the array from index i to i+k.
* For each subarray of length k, calculate its maximum value and update dp[i][k] accordingly.
* For subarrays with lengths less than k, consider them as single elements and update dp[i][k] based on their values.
* To avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency, implement memoization using a dictionary to store the dynamic programming states and their corresponding values.
* Finally, return the maximum value from the table, which represents the largest sum of the given array after partitioning.
