Determine if the problem has a greedy property. If so, consider using a greedy algorithm with dynamic programming to solve the problem.

For this problem, it is not entirely clear that the problem has a greedy property. In fact, the problem statement does not mention anything about maximizing or minimizing any subproblem greedily. This suggests that a more thorough analysis may be necessary to determine if a greedy approach would be effective.

To consider the maximum sum of all possible partitions of the array into k contiguous subarrays as the state, with base case being when k is 1.

This seems like a reasonable approach. By considering the maximum sum of each partition as the state, we can recursively build up the solution to the problem.

The transition relationship can be modified to consider the effect of changing the values of each subarray to become the maximum value of that subarray.

To do this, we could use a dynamic programming table to store the results of subproblems. The size of this table would be O(n * k), where n is the length of the array and k is the partition size.

You could implement a top-down dynamic programming approach using memoization, where you recursively calculate the maximum sum of each subarray and store the results in a dictionary for future reference.

This seems like a good idea. By using memoization, we can avoid recalculating the same subproblems multiple times, which would be very inefficient.

To handle edge cases:

- What happens if k is larger than the length of the array? In this case, we don't need to partition at all.
- What if there are no elements in the array that are greater than 0? In this case, the maximum sum would still be 0.

These edge cases should be handled separately from the main logic of the problem.
