1. Determine if the problem has an optimal substructure that allows us to use dynamic programming to solve it: YES

2. Choose a state that represents the maximum sum of all possible partitions of the array into k contiguous subarrays with a base case when k is 1:
   Let dp[i][k] be the maximum sum of all possible partitions of arr[0...i-1] into k contiguous subarrays.

3. Apply memoization by using a dictionary to store previously computed values and reuse them to avoid redundant calculations: YES

4. Initialize the base case when k is 1:
   For i from 1 to n, dp[i][1] = max(arr[0...i-1])

5. Fill up the dynamic programming table recursively for each state (dp[i][k]):
   For i from 1 to n and k from 2 to min(i, k)
     Calculate dp[i][k] by considering all possible partitions of arr[0...i-1] into k contiguous subarrays
     Store previously computed values in the dictionary to avoid redundant calculations

6. Return dp[n][k], which represents the maximum sum of all possible partitions of the array into k contiguous subarrays.
