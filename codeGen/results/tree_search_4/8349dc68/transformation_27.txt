===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a 2D table dp[][] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of all partitions ending at index j, using at most i elements (i.e., the first i elements of the array). 
The transition function is as follows: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k-1] + arr[k-1], dp[i-1][k] + arr[j]) where 0 <= k <= j, k-i+1 <= min(k, j)
This formula calculates the maximum sum of all partitions ending at index j, using at most i elements. It takes into account two possibilities: either the last element is part of the partition (in which case we consider it along with its previous i-1 elements), or it's not (in which case we continue considering the same partition as before).
Use memoization to store the maximum sum of all partitions ending at index j, using at most k elements. This will prevent unnecessary calculations and improve efficiency.
Finally, return dp[n][n] where n is the length of the array, as it represents the maximum sum of all partitions of the entire array.
