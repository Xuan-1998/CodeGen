dp[i][k] as the maximum value that can be achieved by partitioning the subarray from index i to i+k;
View dp[i][k] as the maximum value that can be achieved by partitioning the subarray from index i to i+k, and consider the state transition as the maximum value among this subarray and its previous maximum values
Transition function: max(dp[i-1][j-1] for j in range(k+1)) + arr[i]
Consider edge case where k is 1.
Memoization function using a dictionary to store and retrieve previously computed values of dp[i][k].
Initialize dp[0][0] = 0.
dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], arr[i])
