===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the maximum value of each subarray as a state, and use memoization to store the maximum sum for each prefix. Then, dynamically calculate the maximum sum for each subarray by considering the maximum value of the previous subarray.

Let dp[i] be the maximum sum up to index i. Initialize dp[0] = 0.

For j from k to n:
    If j-k+1 <= k, then we are considering a new window.
        Calculate the maximum value in this window as max(arr[j-k+1:j]).
    Else, we are continuing an existing window.
        Calculate the maximum sum of the previous window as dp[j-1].
        Add the maximum value in the current window to get the maximum sum for the current window.

Update dp[i] = max(dp[j-1] + max(arr[j-k+1:j]), 0) for j from k to n, where dp[0] = 0 and dp[i] < 0 for i > 0

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming where the state represents the current window's maximum value, and the transition is calculated based on the maximum values of the previous windows.

Create a dictionary to store the maximum sum for each prefix, where the key is the index of the array and the value is the maximum sum up to that index.
