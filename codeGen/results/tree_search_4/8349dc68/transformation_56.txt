===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has an optimal substructure property. If so, consider using dynamic programming to solve the problem.

Observe that the problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems: partitioning the array into contiguous subarrays of length at most k, and then maximizing the sum of each subarray.

Consider the maximum value of each subarray as the state, with base case being when the subarray consists of only one element. The state is the maximum value of the current subarray, and the transition relationship is that it updates to the maximum value between the current maximum value and the maximum value of the next subarray.

Use dynamic programming with a 1D table where the state is the index representing the current position in the array. Initialize the table with the maximum values of each subarray as the base case, then update the table by considering the maximum values of the next subarrays.

Finally, calculate the largest sum of the given array after partitioning by iterating through the dynamic programming table and adding up the maximum values of each subarray.
