===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the maximum value of each subarray as a state, and use memoization to store the maximum sum for each prefix. Then, dynamically calculate the maximum sum for each subarray by considering the maximum value of the previous subarray.

dp[i] represents the maximum sum of arr[:i], where i is the length of a subarray.

DP state: 
if i < k:
    dp[i] = max(arr[0:i])
elif i >= k:
    dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], arr[i]) + dp[i-k]

===END PLAN===
