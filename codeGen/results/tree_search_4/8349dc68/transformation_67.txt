===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has an optimal substructure property. If so, consider using dynamic programming to solve the problem.

For example, partition the array into k contiguous subarrays based on their maximum values, and recursively calculate the maximum sum of each subarray.

To consider the maximum sum of all possible partitions of the array into k contiguous subarrays as the state, with base case being when k is 1. The transition relationship can be defined as the maximum sum of the current subarray plus the maximum sum of all possible partitions of the remaining array into k-1 contiguous subarrays.

Implement memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

Initialize the memoization dictionary with base cases for k=1, and fill it up by solving subproblems from bottom-up approach.

Finally, return the maximum sum value from the memoization dictionary as the solution.
