===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has an optimal substructure. The problem does have an optimal substructure, as we can break it down into smaller subproblems: partitioning the array into subarrays and calculating the maximum sum of each subarray.

Consider using dynamic programming to solve the problem. Define a state dp[i] that represents the maximum sum of the subarray ending at index i. The transition relationship can be formulated by updating this maximum value considering the current subarray.

Define the base case: dp[0] = arr[0], since the maximum sum of an array with only one element is the element itself.

For each subsequent state dp[i], consider the maximum value encountered so far in the current subarray, which can be calculated as max(arr[j]) for j = i-k to i. Update this maximum value considering the current subarray and previously computed states.

Use a combination of tabulation and memoization to precompute the maximum sum of small subarrays and then extend this computation to larger subarrays. This approach ensures that each subproblem is solved only once, reducing the time complexity of the algorithm.
