===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has an optimal substructure property and can be solved using dynamic programming.

If so, consider using a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming to solve the problem. For example, partition the array into subarrays based on their maximum values, and recursively calculate the maximum sum of each subarray.

Define the state as dp[i][j] representing the maximum sum of the array when divided into j partitions and the ith partition ends at index i. The base case is when the number of partitions is 1 (i.e., no need to further partition), in which case the maximum sum is simply the cumulative sum up to that index.

Formulate the transition relationship based on the comparison with the maximum value in each subarray:
- If the current subarray has a maximum value less than or equal to k, we can further divide it into smaller partitions.
- Otherwise, we cannot partition this subarray anymore and the maximum sum remains the same as the cumulative sum up to that index.

Create a dp table with (k+1) rows and n columns. Initialize all values in the first row to -INFINITY, representing the maximum sum when there is no partition at all.
Iterate over the array from left to right:
  - For each element at index i, update the value in the jth column of the dp table (where j is the number of partitions) based on the transition relationship above.
  - Update the maximum sum found so far by comparing the current maximum sum with the value in the last column of the dp table.

Return the maximum sum found as the result.
