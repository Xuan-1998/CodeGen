===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has a greedy property. If so, consider using a greedy algorithm with dynamic programming to solve the problem.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming and top-down memoization.

The state will be the maximum sum of all possible partitions of the array into k contiguous subarrays.
The base case is when k is 1, where the maximum sum is simply the maximum value in the current subarray.

Consider using a recursive function that calculates the maximum sum for each partition, and store the results in a dictionary to avoid repeated calculations.

To calculate the maximum sum for a given partition, iterate over all possible partitions of the array into k contiguous subarrays. For each partition, calculate the maximum sum by finding the maximum value in the current subarray, adding it to the maximum sum of all possible partitions of the remaining subarray into (k-1) contiguous subarrays.

Store the results of each recursive call in a dictionary to avoid repeated calculations.
When the base case is reached (when k is 1), return the maximum value in the current subarray as the maximum sum.

To improve the plan, consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach instead of top-down memoization. This can reduce the time complexity by avoiding repeated recursive calls.

Potential issues with the plan include:
- Edge cases: What if the input array is empty or k is 0? In this case, we need to handle these edge cases correctly.
- The maximum sum may not be calculated correctly if there are multiple possible partitions of the array into k contiguous subarrays. We need to ensure that all possible partitions are considered.
