===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has an optimal substructure property. If so, consider using dynamic programming to solve the problem.

The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems as follows:

1. Divide the array into subarrays of length k.
2. For each subarray, find its maximum value by iterating through the elements in the subarray.
3. The state is the maximum value of the current subarray, and the transition relationship is that it updates to the maximum value of the current element if it's greater than the previous maximum value.

Consider using memoization with a dictionary to store the computed values for each subarray, reducing redundant calculations.

The base case is when the subarray consists of only one element. In this case, the maximum sum of the subarray is simply the value of that single element.

To improve the plan, consider sorting the array in descending order and then iterating through it to find the maximum values of each subarray.

Potential issues with the plan include:

* Edge cases: What if k is greater than the length of the array? Or what if the array has only one element?
* How to handle the case where a subarray contains all negative numbers?

To address these edge cases, add additional checks and handling code as needed.
