===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has an optimal substructure property. If so, consider using dynamic programming with memoization to solve the problem.

Consider the maximum sum of each subarray as the state, with base case being when the subarray consists of only one element.

The state is the maximum sum of a subarray ending at index i, and the transition relationship is that it's equal to the maximum value in the subarray plus the maximum sum of the remaining subarrays.

Utilize memoization by defining a recursive function that returns the maximum sum for a given subarray, with memoization cache to store the results of subproblems.

Partition the array into subarrays based on their lengths. Calculate the maximum sum of each subarray recursively and store it in the memoization cache.

The dynamic programming table can be constructed as follows:
- Initialize the table with the base case value (when the subarray consists of only one element).
- For each subarray, calculate its maximum sum using the transition relationship.
- Store the result in the table for future reference.

At the end, return the maximum sum of all subarrays.
