===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has an optimal substructure property. If so, consider using dynamic programming to solve the problem.

The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems: partition the array into subarrays of length at most k, and recursively calculate the maximum sum of each subarray.

Consider the state as the maximum sum of a subarray, with base case being when the subarray consists of only one element. The state is updated based on the maximum values of the current subarray and the remaining subarrays.

Use dynamic programming with bottom-up approach to fill up a 2D table where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum sum of the subarray ending at index j and partitioned into subarrays of length at most i.

For each cell, calculate the maximum sum by considering the maximum values of the current subarray and the remaining subarrays. The transition relationship is that the maximum sum of the current subarray plus the maximum sum of the remaining subarrays.

The table is filled up from bottom to top and from left to right. The base case is when i equals 1, where the maximum sum is simply the value at index j.

Finally, return the maximum sum in the top-right cell as the answer.
