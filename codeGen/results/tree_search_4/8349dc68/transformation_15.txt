===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the maximum value of each subarray as a state, and use memoization to store the maximum sum for each prefix. Then, dynamically calculate the maximum sum for each subarray by considering the maximum value of the previous subarray.

dp[i] = max(dp[j-1] + max(arr[j-k+1:j]), 0) for j from k to n, where dp[0] = 0 and dp[i] < 0 for i > 0

Use a sliding window approach to keep track of the maximum sum of the current window, and update it accordingly as you slide through the array.

Initialize an array maxSum of size n+1 with all values set to 0. Then, iterate through the array and update maxSum[j] as follows:

maxSum[i] = max(maxSum[i-1], dp[i]) for i from k to n

Finally, return the maximum value in the maxSum array, which represents the largest sum of the given array after partitioning.
