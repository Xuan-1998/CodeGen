===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the maximum value of each subarray as a state, and use memoization to store the maximum sum for each prefix. Then, dynamically calculate the maximum sum for each subarray by considering the maximum value of the previous subarray.

let state(i, j) be the maximum sum of arr[i-j:i], where i is the end index and j is the length of a subarray. base case: state(i, j) = max(arr[i-j:i]) if i - j <= k

Define state as (i, prev_max) where i is the end index of the current subarray and prev_max is the maximum value of the previous subarray. Define a function f(i, prev_max) that returns the maximum sum for arr[:i].

The transition relationship would be: 
f(i, prev_max) = max(arr[i-k:i]) + f(i-k, max_value) where max_value is the maximum value in the current subarray.

Use a dictionary to store the state values and their corresponding maximum sums.

for i in range(k+1):
    memo = {}
    for j in range(k+1):
        if j <= k:
            memo[(i-j, j)] = max(arr[i-j:i]) if i - j <= k else f(i-k, max(arr[i-k:i]))
        else:
            memo[(i-j, j)] = max(arr[i-j:i])
    for j in range(k+1):
        for i in range(j+1, n+1):
            memo[(i-j, j)] = f(i-1, memo.get((i-k-1, k), 0))
return max(memo.values())
