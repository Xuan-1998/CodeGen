===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has an optimal substructure property. If so, consider using dynamic programming to solve the problem.

Define the state as the maximum sum of the array after partitioning into subarrays ending at index i, considering only the current subarray and previously computed states.

Formulate the transition relationship by updating the maximum sum of the current subarray based on the maximum values of the previous subarrays. This can be done by iterating through the array, considering each element as a potential start point for a new subarray, and calculating the maximum sum of the subarray ending at that index.

Apply memoization using a dictionary to store the dynamic programming states. This will help avoid recalculating the same states multiple times.

To improve the plan:

* Consider sorting the array in descending order before partitioning to focus on the most valuable elements first.
* Use a more efficient data structure, such as a binary search tree or a heap, to quickly find the maximum value in each subarray.
* Add edge cases to handle arrays with lengths less than k, and arrays where every element is equal.

The plan does not include edge cases for empty arrays, arrays with only one element, or arrays where k is greater than the length of the array. These should be added to ensure the solution handles all possible inputs correctly.
