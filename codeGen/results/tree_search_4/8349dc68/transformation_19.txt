===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the maximum value of each subarray as a state, and use memoization to store the maximum sum for each prefix. Then, dynamically calculate the maximum sum for each subarray by considering the maximum value of the previous subarray.

let state(i, j) be the maximum sum of arr[i-j:i], where i is the end index and j is the length of a subarray. base case: state(i, 0) = 0; state(0, k) = -âˆž

Consider state as (i, j) where i is the end index of the current subarray and j is its length. Define a function f(i, j) that returns the maximum sum for arr[i-j:i]. The transition relationship would be: f(i, j) = max(arr[i-j:i]) + f(i - 1, min(j, k))

Memoize the state(i, j) as described in your steps using a dictionary, where the key is (i, j) and the value is the maximum sum for arr[i-j:i]. Initialize the memoization dictionary with base cases.
