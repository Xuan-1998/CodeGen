===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has an optimal substructure property and can be solved by dynamic programming. Since we need to find the largest sum after partitioning, it's not directly related to the maximum value of each subarray.

Consider using a prefix sum array to calculate the cumulative sum of the array. Then, for each possible partition point i, calculate the maximum sum that can be achieved by considering the subarray from 0 to i and then recursively calculating the maximum sum for the remaining subarray.

The state is the prefix sum up to the current position, and the transition relationship is that it increases by the value of the current element when moving to the next position. This allows us to calculate the maximum sum for each partition point in O(n) time complexity.

Using memoization with a recursive function that calculates the maximum sum for each subarray, and storing the results in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.
