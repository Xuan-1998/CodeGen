===BEGIN PLAN===
Let's break down the problem into smaller subproblems and use dynamic programming to solve it.

1. Define the state transition function:
    dp[i][k] represents the maximum sum that can be achieved by partitioning the array from index 0 to i+k.
    The function should consider two possibilities:
        - Include the current element in the partition (dp[i-1][k-1] + arr[i-1])
        - Do not include the current element in the partition (dp[i-1][k])

2. Base case: When k = 0, the maximum sum is simply the maximum value of the array up to that point.
    dp[0][0] = max(arr)

3. Fill up the table in a bottom-up manner:
    For each i and k, calculate the maximum sum by considering both possibilities (include or exclude the current element) and choose the maximum.

4. Initialize the base case values:
    dp[i][0] = max(arr[:i+1]) for all i

5. The final answer is the maximum value in the last row of the table.
    max(dp[n-1])
