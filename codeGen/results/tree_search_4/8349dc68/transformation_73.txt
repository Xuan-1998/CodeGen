===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has a greedy property. If so, consider using a greedy algorithm with dynamic programming to solve the problem. In this case, we can partition the array into subarrays based on their maximum values and recursively calculate the maximum sum of each subarray.

To consider the maximum sum of all possible partitions of the array into k contiguous subarrays as the state, with base case being when k is 1. The dynamic programming table dp[i][j] will store the maximum sum for the first i elements and j partitions.

Consider using a loop instead of recursion to improve efficiency, especially for large arrays. This can be achieved by iterating over the array and partitioning it into subarrays based on their maximum values.

Utilize memoization by storing the maximum sum of each subarray in a dictionary. This will help avoid redundant calculations and improve the overall efficiency of the algorithm.

For edge cases, consider handling scenarios where k is greater than or equal to n (the length of the array). In this case, the maximum sum would simply be the sum of all elements in the array.
