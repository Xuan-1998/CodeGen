===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has an optimal substructure property. The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems and solved recursively.

The state for this dynamic programming problem is dp[i][j], which represents the maximum sum that can be obtained by partitioning the array from index 0 to i, with a maximum length of k in each subarray ending at index j.

Consider the transition relationship: if we choose the current element as the end of the last subarray, then the maximum sum is the current element itself. Otherwise, it's the maximum value that can be obtained by partitioning the array from the beginning to i-1 with a maximum length of k in each subarray ending at j-1.

Use a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (k+1) to store the maximum sums. Initialize all values to negative infinity, and then update them accordingly.

To solve the problem, iterate over the array and fill up the dp table row by row. For each cell dp[i][j], calculate the maximum sum that can be obtained by partitioning the array from index 0 to i, with a maximum length of k in each subarray ending at j.

Finally, return dp[n][k] as the maximum sum that can be obtained by partitioning the entire array.
