===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the maximum value of each subarray as a state, and use memoization to store the maximum sum for each prefix. Then, dynamically calculate the maximum sum for each subarray by considering the maximum value of the previous subarray.

let dp(i) be the maximum sum of arr[:i]. Define base case: dp(0) = 0
Define transition relationship: dp(i) = max(arr[i-k:i]) + max(dp(i-k), 0)
Design a recursive function with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
Let state(i, prev_max) where i is the end index of the current subarray and prev_max is the maximum value of the previous subarray. Define f(i, prev_max) that returns the maximum sum for arr[:i]. The transition relationship would be: f(i, prev_max) = max(arr[i-k:i]) + f(i-k, prev_max)
