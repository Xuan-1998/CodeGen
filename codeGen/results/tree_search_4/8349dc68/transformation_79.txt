===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has a greedy property. If so, consider using a greedy algorithm with dynamic programming to solve the problem.

To determine the maximum sum of all possible partitions of the array into k contiguous subarrays as the state, use a bottom-up approach by initializing an array dp of size n+1 and filling it up based on the following transition relation:

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], arr[i-1] + max(0, dp[j]-arr[j-1])) for j=k to i-k+1

where dp[0] is initialized as 0.

The base case is when k is 1. In this case, the maximum sum of each subarray can be calculated by recursively calling the function on each subarray and adding the maximum value of that subarray.

To consider the effect of changing the values of each subarray to become the maximum value of that subarray, update dp[i] accordingly based on the transition relation.

Use a hybrid approach that combines bottom-up and top-down methods to achieve better performance. Start by filling up the dp array in a bottom-up manner and then use this information to calculate the maximum sum of all possible partitions in a top-down manner.
