===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the maximum value of each subarray as a state, and use memoization to store the maximum sum for each prefix. Then, dynamically calculate the maximum sum for each subarray by considering the maximum value of the previous subarray.

dp[i] represents the maximum sum of arr[:i], where i is the length of a subarray.
DP state: dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], arr[i]) + dp[i-k] if i >= k
dp[0] = 0, since there's no previous subarray

Let's break down the plan step by step:
1. Initialize dp array with all zeros: dp = [0]*n
2. For each subarray of length up to k:
    a. Calculate the maximum value in this subarray (max subarray): max_subarray = max(arr[i:i+k])
    b. Add the maximum value to the sum of the previous subarrays: dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], max_subarray) + dp[i-k]
3. Return the maximum sum from the dp array: return max(dp)

This plan seems correct, but it's missing edge cases:
* If k is 0 or less, we need to handle this case separately.
* When i is less than k, we need to handle the initial subarrays.

We can improve the plan by adding these edge cases and handling them correctly. For example, when i is less than k, we can simply take the maximum value of that subarray as the sum for that subarray.
