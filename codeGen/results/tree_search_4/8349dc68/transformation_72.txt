===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has a greedy property. If so, consider using a greedy algorithm with dynamic programming to solve the problem.

Consider the following:

* Initialize a dynamic programming table dp of size n x k + 1, where n is the length of the array and k is the partition limit.
* For each subarray of length up to k:
	+ Calculate the maximum value in the subarray
	+ Store this value in the dp table for future reference
* Initialize a variable max_sum to store the maximum sum found so far.
* Iterate over the dp table from left to right, considering each possible partition of the array into k contiguous subarrays.
	+ For each partition:
		- Calculate the sum of the values in this partition
		- Update max_sum if the sum is greater than what was previously recorded.
* Return the maximum sum found.

Consider using a loop instead of recursion to improve efficiency, especially for large arrays. This can be achieved by iterating over the dp table and updating the values accordingly.

Use a dynamic programming table to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

Edge cases:
	+ If k is greater than the length of the array, return 0 as there are no partitions.
	+ If k is equal to the length of the array, return the sum of all elements in the array.
