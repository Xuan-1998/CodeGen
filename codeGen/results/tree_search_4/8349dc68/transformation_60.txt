===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem has an optimal substructure property. If so, consider using dynamic programming to solve the problem.

Consider the maximum sum of all possible partitions of the array into k contiguous subarrays as the state. The base case would be when k is 1, since for k = 1, the maximum sum of a single-element subarray is simply the value of that element.

Use dynamic programming to store intermediate results in an array dp, where dp[i] represents the maximum sum of all possible partitions of the array into i contiguous subarrays. The recurrence relation would be:

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], arr[j] + dp[i-2])

where j is the last element of the i-th subarray.

To fill in the dp array, start with dp[0] = 0 and for each i from 1 to k, calculate dp[i] based on the previous values of dp. Finally, return dp[k].
