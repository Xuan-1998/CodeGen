===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, where each subproblem has a distinct optimal solution.
Define the state expression as dp[i], where dp[i-1] is the previous longest subarray and dp[i] is the maximum length of subarray containing only 1's ending at index i, and the base case as dp[0] = 0.
Let dp[i][j] be the maximum length of subarray containing only 1's with an extra '1' at position j; then 
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1][k], k+1 for k in range(len(nums)) if nums[k] == 1)
If all elements are 0, dp[i] would be 0.
