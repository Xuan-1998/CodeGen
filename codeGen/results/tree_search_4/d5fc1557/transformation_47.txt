===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize the maximum length of 1's found in previous subarrays using a dictionary to store the results, where keys are indices and values are the corresponding maximum lengths.

State: dp[i] = maximum length of 1's found in nums[:i+1]
Transition:
    - If nums[i] == 0:
        dp[i+1] = 0
    - Else (nums[i] == 1):
        dp[i+1] = dp[i] + 1

To avoid unnecessary computation, update the maximum length only when a 1 is encountered.

===END PLAN===
