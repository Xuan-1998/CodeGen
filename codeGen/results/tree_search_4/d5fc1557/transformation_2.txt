===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, where each subproblem has a distinct optimal solution.

Define the state expression as dp[i], representing the maximum length of subarray containing only 1's ending at index i, and the base case as dp[0] = 1 if nums[0] == 1, otherwise dp[0] = 0.

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] + (nums[i] == 1), 1) if i > 0
else dp[0]
