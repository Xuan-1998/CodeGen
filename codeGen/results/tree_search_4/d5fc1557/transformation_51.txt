===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize the maximum length of 1's found in previous subarrays to avoid redundant computation.

State: (i, j) represents the start and end indices of the current subarray.

Transition:
    - If nums[i] == nums[j], then dp[i+1][j+1] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j]) + 2
    - Else, dp[i+1][j+1] = 0

Use a dictionary to store the maximum length of 1's found in previous subarrays. Initialize dp with zeros.

Iterate through the array from left to right, and for each index i:
    - For j from i to n-1:
        - Update dp[i][j] based on the transition rule
        - If dp[i][j] > 0, then update the maximum length of 1's found so far

Return the maximum length of 1's found as the answer.
