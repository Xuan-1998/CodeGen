===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, where each subproblem has a distinct optimal solution.

Define the state expression as dp[i], where:

- dp[0] is the previous longest subarray and represents the maximum length of subarray containing only 1's ending at index i.
- The base case is dp[0] = 0.

The dynamic programming recurrence relation is:

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], 1) if nums[i] == 1 else 0

This plan correctly captures the essence of the problem. It recognizes that the maximum length of a subarray containing only 1's ending at index i depends on whether the current element (nums[i]) is a 1 or a 0.

The dynamic programming approach accurately reflects the problem's structure and allows for efficient computation of the optimal solution.
