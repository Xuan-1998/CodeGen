===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize the maximum length of 1's found in previous subarrays by storing the maximum length and its corresponding ending index.
Maintain two variables: max_len and end_idx, where max_len is the maximum length of 1's seen so far and end_idx is the last index at which this maximum length was achieved.
Initialize max_len to 0 and end_idx to -1.
Iterate through the array from left to right:
    If the current element is 1, update max_len and end_idx accordingly.
    Else (current element is 0), consider two possibilities:
        If the subarray ending at end_idx has more than one 1's, increment max_len by 1 and update end_idx to be the current index.
        Else (subarray ending at end_idx contains only one 1), reset max_len to 1 and set end_idx to be the current index.
    Finally, return max_len as the answer.
