===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, where each subproblem has a distinct optimal solution.

Define the state expression as dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], 0) if nums[i] == 0 else dp[i-1] + (nums[i] == 1).
dp[0] = 0 is the base case.

Use memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant computations.

As we iterate over the array, for each 1, we can update our maximum length of consecutive ones seen so far. If we encounter a 0, we reset this count.
We also keep track of whether the previous element was 0 or 1. This allows us to handle edge cases where there are no more consecutive ones.

This plan correctly captures the essence of the problem and avoids redundant computations using memoization.
