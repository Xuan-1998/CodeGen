===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, where each subproblem has a distinct optimal solution.

Define the state expression as dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], (nums[i] == 1) ? dp[i-1] + 1 : 0) and the base case as dp[0] = 0.

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], (nums[i] == 1) ? dp[i-1] + 1 : 0);
Apply memoization by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when possible.
For edge cases, consider handling arrays with only one element or zero elements separately. In this case, return 0 if the array contains all zeros or has only one element.
