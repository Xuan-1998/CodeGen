===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, where each subproblem has a distinct optimal solution.
Define the state expression as dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], (nums[i] == 1)) and the base case as dp[0] = 0.
We need to maintain a variable for the maximum length of the subarray seen so far. Let's call it max_length.
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], (nums[i] == 1) ? (max_length + 1) : 0)
If nums[i] is 1, then we update max_length and consider this index as a start of the subarray.
In the base case dp[0] = 0, we initialize max_length to 0. 
Employ a dictionary to store the memoized values and perform lookups as needed.
