===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize the maximum length of 1's found in previous subarrays to avoid redundant computation.
The state is a pair (i, j) representing the start and end indices of the current subarray.
State: dp[i][j] represents the maximum length of 1's ending at index j
Transition: 
    if nums[j] == 1:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], 1 + (dp[i][j-2] if i > 0 else 0))
    else:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]
Memoize the state and transition functions to avoid redundant computation by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.
When deleting an element, update the maximum length accordingly
Return max(dp[-1][-1]) as the result
