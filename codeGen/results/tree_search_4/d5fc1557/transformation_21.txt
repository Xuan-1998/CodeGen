===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, where each subproblem has a distinct optimal solution.

Define the state expression as dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], (nums[i] == 1) ? dp[i-1] + 1 : 0) and the base case as dp[0] = 0.

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], (nums[i] == 1) ? dp[i-1] + 1 : 0); 
Consider using dynamic programming by defining a bottom-up approach with a state variable and base cases, where we keep track of the maximum length of the subarray containing only ones.
