===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize the maximum length of 1's found in previous subarrays to avoid redundant computation.
The state is just the index i, as we only care about the number of 1's after this point.
Consider the current index i as state, with transition being the maximum length of 1's seen at previous indices j such that nums[j] == 1
Create a table with dimensions (n, 2) where the value at row i and column j represents the maximum length of 1's seen up to this point.

===END PLAN===
