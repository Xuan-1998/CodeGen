===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the dynamic programming table row by row, where each cell represents the longest subarray with only 1's up to that point.

The base case is when i == 0, then dp[i] should be 0 because there are no 1's to consider. 

State relationship: dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], (dp[i-1] if nums[i] == 1 else 0)) 
This ensures that we consider the current element and its previous ones.

Use memoization by creating a dictionary and initializing it with default value 0, then update the values iteratively. 

For edge cases: If the input array is empty or contains only zeros, return 0.
