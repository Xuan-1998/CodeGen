===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, where each subproblem has a distinct optimal solution.

Define the state expression as dp[i], where dp[i-1] is the previous longest subarray and dp[i] is the maximum length of subarray containing only 1's ending at index i, and the base case as dp[0] = 0.

dp[i] is the maximum of:

* dp[i-1] + (nums[i] == 1) if nums[i] is 1
* 0 otherwise

This ensures that we consider the previous longest subarray and update it accordingly based on the current element.

Use a dynamic programming table to store the state values, initialized with all values set to 0. This allows us to efficiently compute dp[i] for each i in O(n).

To find the length of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's after deleting one element, we can iterate through the dp array and return the maximum value that is greater than 0.

If no such subarray exists, return 0.

This plan handles edge cases by considering all possible subarrays and updating the state values accordingly.
