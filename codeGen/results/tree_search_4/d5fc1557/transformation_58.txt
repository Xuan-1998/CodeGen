===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the dynamic programming table row by row, where each cell represents the longest subarray with only 1's up to that point.

Let dp[i] represent the length of the longest subarray containing only 1's in the first i elements of nums.

Consider dp[i] as the maximum number of consecutive 1s ending at index i, considering previous deletions and current array.

DP with iteration from left to right and a separate variable for the length of the current subarray:

    1. Initialize dp[0] = 1 (since the longest subarray containing only 1's in the first element is 1)
    2. For each index i from 1 to n-1:
        - If nums[i] == 1 and nums[i-1] == 1, then dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1 (extend the current subarray)
        - Else if nums[i] == 0 or nums[i-1] == 0, then dp[i] = 1 (reset the current subarray to length 1)
    3. Return max(1, dp[n-2]) as the length of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's
