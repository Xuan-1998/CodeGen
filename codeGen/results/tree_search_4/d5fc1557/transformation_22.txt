===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, where each subproblem has a distinct optimal solution.

Define the state expression as dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] + (nums[i] == 1), nums.count(1)) and the base case as dp[0] = 0.

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] + (nums[i] == 1), 0)

Determine the optimal substructure by considering the current element and the maximum length of the previous subarray.
If the current element is 1, then we can extend the previous subarray with more 1's. If it's 0, then the previous subarray must have ended.

The base case ensures that the maximum length of an empty subarray is 0.
