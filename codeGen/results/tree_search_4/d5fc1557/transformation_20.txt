===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, where each subproblem has a distinct optimal solution.

Define the state expression as dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] + (nums[i] == 1), nums.count(1) - i + 1)

and the base case as dp[0] = 0. This is because if we encounter a 0, there can't be any consecutive 1's after that.

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] + (nums[i] == 1), nums.count(1) - i + 1)
    if nums[i] == 1 and dp[i-1] > nums.count(1) - i, 
    else dp[i-1];

Dynamically generate the state transitions in a bottom-up manner, using the base case as a starting point.

If we encounter a 0, reset our maximum length to the current position minus the count of 1's seen so far.
Otherwise, increment the maximum length if it's still possible.

This plan handles edge cases correctly and captures the optimal substructure of the problem. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the input array. This can be further optimized to O(1) by maintaining a variable for the current count of consecutive 1's.
