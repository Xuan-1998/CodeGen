Memoize the maximum length of 1's found in previous subarrays to avoid redundant computation.

# Initialize memo dictionary with default value as 0 (for index 0)
memo = {0: 0}

# Define state transition function
def transition(i, memo):
    # If this is the first 1 encountered after a sequence of 0's, reset the count
    if i > 0 and nums[i] == 1:
        return 1
    # Otherwise, consider the maximum length of 1's seen at previous indices j such that nums[j] == 1
    else:
        for j in range(i):
            if memo.get(j, 0) == 1:  # Check if memoized value is 1
                return memo[j] + 1

# Initialize maximum length of 1's to 0
max_length = 0

# Iterate over the array and update maximum length
for i in range(len(nums)):
    max_length = max(max_length, transition(i, memo))
    # Update memo dictionary with new state value
    memo[i] = max_length

# Return the maximum length of 1's found in the entire array (or 0 if no 1's were found)
