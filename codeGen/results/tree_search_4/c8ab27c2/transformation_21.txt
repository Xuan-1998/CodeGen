===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming for a bottom-up approach by iterating over the characters in both strings, updating the DP table accordingly
Define dp[i][j] as the length of the shortest subsequence in S[:i] that is not a subsequence in T[:j]
Update dp[i][0] as 1 + dp[i-1][0] if the current character of S is not equal to the first character of T, otherwise update it as max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i][j])
Update dp[0][j] as 1 + dp[0][j-1] if the first character of S is not equal to the current character of T, otherwise update it as max(dp[0][j], dp[i][j])
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D DP table with dimensions (len(S) + 1) x (len(T) + 1), and iteratively update the values based on the previous ones
Return dp[len(S)][len(T)] as the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence
