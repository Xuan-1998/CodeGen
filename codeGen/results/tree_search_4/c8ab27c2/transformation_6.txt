===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming for a bottom-up approach by iterating over the characters in both strings, updating the DP table accordingly

Consider dp[i][j] as the length of the shortest subsequence ending at index i in string S and j in string T.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1 if S[i] != T[j]
      else dp[i-1][j-1]

Use a dictionary to store the indices of characters in string T as keys and their corresponding values in the form of lists of indices where they appear in S.

For each character in S, iterate over the dictionary to find its last occurrence in S. If it's found before reaching the end of S, update dp[i][j] accordingly.

Store the minimum value of dp[i][j] for all i and j as the result.
