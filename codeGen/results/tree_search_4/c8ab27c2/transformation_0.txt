===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming for a bottom-up approach by iterating over the characters in both strings, updating the DP table accordingly
Consider dp[i][j] as the length of the shortest subsequence ending at index i in string S and j in string T.
dp[i][j] = 1 if S[i] != T[j], else min(dp[i-1][j-1], max(1, dp[i-1][j]))
Iterate over the characters in both strings
Update dp table accordingly based on the characters
For each character in S, find its longest uncommon subsequence (LCS) with T
If no such subsequence is found, return -1
Calculate the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence by iterating over the characters in S and checking if it's not a LCS with any character in T
Update the result accordingly
