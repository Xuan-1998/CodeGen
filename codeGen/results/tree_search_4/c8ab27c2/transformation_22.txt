===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming for a bottom-up approach by iterating over the characters in both strings, updating the DP table accordingly
Define dp[i][j] as the length of the shortest subsequence in S[:i] that is not a subsequence in T[:j]
Update dp[i][j] as the minimum value between the previous dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], and 1 + dp[i-1][j-1] if the current character of S is not equal to the current character of T
Implement memoization using a dictionary to store the computed values, which can be used to avoid redundant computations during the dynamic programming process
If at any point dp[i][j] is greater than the length of the shorter string, return -1 as it means there's no such subsequence possible
Return dp[m-1][n-1] as the result, where m and n are the lengths of S and T respectively
