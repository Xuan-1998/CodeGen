===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming for a bottom-up approach by iterating over the characters in both strings, updating the DP table accordingly
Think of dp[i][j] as the minimum length of a subsequence that ends with character S[i-1] and T[j-1].
Define base cases as: 
  - dp[0][j] = j (since empty subsequence in S has length j)
  - dp[i][0] = i (since empty subsequence in T has length i)
Consider using memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant computations.
Iterate over the characters in both strings, comparing character S[i-1] with T[j-1].
If they are equal, update dp[i][j] as dp[i-1][j-1], since we can extend the current subsequence by one more character.
If they are not equal, consider two cases:
  - If this is the first occurrence of character S[i-1] in S and it's present in T, then our minimum length would be dp[i][j-1] + 1 (extend the subsequence in T)
  - Otherwise, we can't extend the current subsequence, so update dp[i][j] as dp[i-1][j]
Finally, return dp[m][n]-1 where m and n are the lengths of strings S and T respectively.
This value represents the minimum length of a subsequence that ends with character S[m-1] and T[n-1].
