===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming for a bottom-up approach by iterating over the characters in both strings, updating the DP table accordingly.

Define dp[i][j] as the length of the shortest subsequence in S[:i] that is not a subsequence in T[:j].

Update dp[i][0] and dp[0][j] as 1 if the current character of S is not equal to the current character of T, and similarly for dp[i-1][0] and dp[0][j-1]. This ensures we consider subsequences that start with different characters.

Initialize dp[0][j] to j and dp[i][0] to i for all i and j. This represents the case where S and T have no common prefix, so the shortest uncommon subsequence is just the remaining part of either string.

Update dp[i][j] as the minimum value between the previous dp[i-1][j-1] and 1 + min(dp[i-1][0], dp[0][j-1]) if the current characters of S and T match, and similarly for dp[i][j-1]. This handles the case where the shortest uncommon subsequence is a single character that appears in both strings.

Return dp[m][n] as the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence, where m and n are the lengths of S and T respectively. If no such subsequence exists, return -1.
