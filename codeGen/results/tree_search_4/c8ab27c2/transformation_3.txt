===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming for a bottom-up approach by iterating over the characters in both strings, updating the DP table accordingly
Consider dp[i][j] as the length of the shortest subsequence ending at index i in string S and j in string T.

For each character pair (s, t) where s is from S and t is from T:
    If s is not equal to t, then consider two cases:
        1. If the remaining part of S is a subsequence of the remaining part of T, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
        2. Otherwise, dp[i][j] = i+1
    Else if s is equal to t, then consider two cases:
        1. If both characters are from the end of their respective strings, then dp[i][j] = i+1
        2. Otherwise, dp[i-1][j-1]
Store the dynamic programming table values in a dictionary and look up previously computed values before computing new ones.

To find the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence, iterate over the DP table and find the minimum value where S[:i+1] is not a subsequence in T. If no such value is found, return -1.
