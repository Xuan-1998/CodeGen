===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming for a bottom-up approach by iterating over the characters in both strings S and T, updating the DP table accordingly.

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum length of a subsequence that ends with character S[i-1] and T[j-1].
Consider transition relationships:
    - If characters match (S[i-1] == T[j-1]), then dp[i][j] is equal to min(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1, max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]))
    - Else, if characters do not match, then dp[i][j] is equal to max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

Use dynamic programming by creating a table and updating it in a bottom-up manner using the relationship between the current character and previous characters.

Initialize the DP table with zeros for all i and j.
Iterate over the strings S and T simultaneously, starting from the first characters:
    - If characters match, update dp[i][j] accordingly.
    - Else, update dp[i][j] to be the maximum of its neighbors in the table.
Finally, return the minimum value in the last row of the DP table as the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence.

If no such subsequence is possible (i.e., all values in the last row are equal), return -1.
