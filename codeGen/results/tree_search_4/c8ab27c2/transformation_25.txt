===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming for a bottom-up approach by iterating over the characters in both strings, updating the DP table accordingly.

Define dp[i][j] as the length of the shortest subsequence in S[:i] that is not a subsequence in T[:j].
Initialize dp[0][0] to 0. For each character in S and T respectively, check if they match or not.
If the characters match, update dp[i][j] to dp[i-1][j-1] + 1.
Else, consider two cases:
    1) If dp[i-1][j] is greater than 0, it means we can extend the shortest subsequence in S[:i] that is not a subsequence in T[:j].
       So, update dp[i][j] to dp[i-1][j].
    2) Else, it means there's no such subsequence.
       So, update dp[i][j] to dp[i][j-1].

Finally, the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence is stored in dp[m][n], where m and n are the lengths of strings S and T respectively.
