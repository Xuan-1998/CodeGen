===BEGIN PLAN===
DP_state = (subsets, sums), where subsets is a set of all possible subsets and sums is a set of all possible sums
Base case: DP_state({set()}, {0})
DP_state = (current_subset, subsets_sum), where current_subset is the current subset being processed and subsets_sum is the set of sums generated from the subsets so far

Memoization using recursive function with base case: DP_state({set()}, {0})

1. Initialize a dictionary memo to store the results of subproblems
2. Define a recursive function dp that takes two parameters: current_subset and subsets_sum
3. If current_subset is empty, return {0} (base case)
4. For each element in current_subset:
    - Calculate the sum with this element added (sum + ai)
    - Check if this sum already exists in memo; if it does, skip it
    - Recursively call dp with the subset of elements excluding ai and the new sum; append this result to subsets_sum
    - Add this new sum to subsets_sum
5. Return subsets_sum

The plan is correct, but it can be improved by using a more efficient memoization technique, such as dynamic programming arrays instead of dictionary.
