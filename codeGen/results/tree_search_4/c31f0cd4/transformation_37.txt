===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the solution to the current problem depends on the solutions to the subproblems of smaller sizes.

State: View the problem as generating all subsets of the given set and compute their sums. For each possible sum, we can determine if it is distinct by checking its presence in a set or array.

State: dp[i][sum] represents the number of ways to generate the sum 'sum' from the first 'i' elements.
Transition relationship: dp[i][sum] is the sum of dp[j][sum-k] for all 0 <= k <= sum and 1 <= j < i. This can be implemented using a prefix sum array, which allows us to calculate the cumulative sum in O(1) time.

Create a two-dimensional array to store the dynamic programming table, where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to generate sum 'j' from the first 'i' elements.
Update the transition relationship by considering the current element ai. If ai is included in the subset, it contributes to some sums that were previously generated without ai. Conversely, if ai is not included, it will contribute to new sums that were not previously generated.

Edge cases:
- Handle N=0 or N=1 separately as there are no subsets and no distinct sums can be generated.
- Handle sum = 0, as there is always one way to generate this sum (the empty subset).
