DP_state = (i, j), where i is the current subset and j is the current sum
memo = {}
base case: DP_state(0, 0) returns a list with just one element: 0
for each integer in the input:
    for each possible sum from previous subsets:
        add the current integer to the sum if it's within the range (0 <= sum <= total_sum)
        update memo[DP_state] = result
    if the new subset is empty, set DP_state(0, 0) as the base case
return a sorted list of unique sums from memo
