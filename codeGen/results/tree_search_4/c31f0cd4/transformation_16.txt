===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of finding all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of a subset of the given set, which is similar to the subset sum problem.

The state expression could be a memoization dictionary where keys are tuples representing subsets and values are lists of achievable sums. The dictionary would store the intermediate results for each subset.

A dynamic programming table with rows for subsets and columns for sums, where each cell stores a list of achievable sums from the corresponding subset.

Use memoization by creating a dictionary where keys are tuples representing subsets and values are lists of achievable sums, and update the dictionary accordingly during the computation process. The initial state would be an empty list of achievable sums.

To generate the dynamic programming table:

* Initialize the table with an empty list for each subset.
* Iterate over each element in the given set:
	+ For each subset that contains the current element:
		- Update the corresponding cell in the dynamic programming table by adding the current element to the existing lists of achievable sums from the previous subsets.
		- Add the sum of the current element and all previously generated sums to the list of achievable sums for the updated subset.

The final result would be the list of achievable sums from the entire set.

To generate the output:

* Initialize an empty set to store the distinct sums.
* Iterate over each cell in the dynamic programming table:
	+ Add the sum from each cell that contains a non-empty list of achievable sums to the set of distinct sums.
* Sort the set of distinct sums and return the result.
