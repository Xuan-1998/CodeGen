===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the solution to the current problem depends on the solutions to the subproblems of smaller sizes.

State: View the problem as generating all subsets of the given set and compute their sums. For each possible sum, we can determine if it is distinct by checking its presence in a set or array.

State: dp[i][j] represents the subset sums from 0 to j using only numbers from 1 to i. Transition relationship: dp[i][j] is the sum of all possible subsets from 1 to i that have a sum equal to j.

Use a dictionary dp where dp[j] stores the subset sums equal to j, then iterate over all elements and update dp[j] if it doesn't exist or add 1 to its value if it does. To improve this plan, consider using a more efficient data structure like a Trie or an array instead of a dictionary.
