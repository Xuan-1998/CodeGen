===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of finding all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of a subset of the given set, which is similar to the subset sum problem.

dp[j][t] = the number of ways to generate sum t using elements up to aj
dp[j][i] = the number of subsets that sum up to i considering the first j elements;

The plan is correct in recognizing the need for dynamic programming. However, there are some potential issues:

* The state expression dp[j][t] might not be accurate because it assumes that all sums less than or equal to t can be generated using elements up to aj, which might not be true.
* The problem statement asks for distinct sums, but the current plan does not account for this.

To improve the plan, we can consider the following:

* Use a more accurate state expression. For example, dp[j][i] could represent the number of subsets that sum up to i considering the first j elements.
* Account for distinct sums by keeping track of the seen sums and only outputting new ones.
* Initialize the memoization table with base cases (e.g., dp[0][i] = 1 if i == 0, otherwise dp[0][i] = 0).

Here's an updated version of the plan:
