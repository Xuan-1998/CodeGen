===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the solution to the current problem depends on the solutions to the subproblems of smaller sizes.

State: Think about the dynamic programming table dp[i][j] where i ranges from 1 to N and j ranges from 0 to sum all elements. The value at dp[i][j] represents whether there exists a subset that sums up to j using the first i elements.
dp[i][j] = True if there exists a subset of the first i numbers that sums up to j, False otherwise.

Create a 2D array dp with dimensions N+1 by sum+1 and initialize all values to False. Initialize the first column as follows: dp[i][0] = True for i ranging from 0 to N (since any subset always sums up to 0), and dp[0][j] = False for j ranging from 1 to sum (since no subset of empty set can sum up to any value except 0).

Fill in the rest of the table by iterating over each element in the input set, updating the dp table accordingly. For each element i, iterate from sum down to the current maximum possible sum value (i.e., j = i), and update dp[i][j] based on whether including or excluding the current element i would lead to a valid subset that sums up to j.

Finally, after filling in the entire dp table, print out all distinct values of j for which dp[N][j] is True.
