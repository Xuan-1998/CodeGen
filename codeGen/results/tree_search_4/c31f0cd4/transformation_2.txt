===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of finding all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of a subset of the given set, which is similar to the subset sum problem.

The state expression could be dp[i][s] = whether s can be generated from subsets of {a1, a2, ..., ai}
dp[i][s] = whether there exists a subset of {a1, a2, ..., ai} whose sum is equal to s, with dp[j][t] being the base case for all j < i and t

The plan can be further improved by initializing dp[s] as false for all s in [0, sum(ai)].

Tabulation with iterative approach where dp[s] represents whether there exists a subset of the given set whose sum is equal to s.
For each ai from 1 to N:
    For each s from 0 to sum(ai):
        if ai <= s:
            dp[s] = or (dp[s-ai], True)
    For each i from 2 to N:
        for each s from 0 to sum(ai):
            if dp[s - ai]:
                dp[s] = or (dp[s], True)

This plan considers all possible subsets of the given set and checks whether there exists a subset whose sum is equal to s. This ensures that all distinct sums are found.

The plan also handles edge cases by considering all possible values of s in [0, sum(ai)].
