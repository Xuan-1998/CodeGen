===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of finding all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of a subset of the given set.

State expression: dp[j][t] = the number of ways to generate sum t using elements up to aj
dp[i][j] = the number of ways to generate sum i using elements from 1 to j;

The state transitions are:
- If ai > t, then there's no way to include ai in the subset that sums up to t. So, dp[j][t] will remain the same as dp[j-1][t]
- If ai <= t, then we can either include ai or not include it. So, dp[j][t] = dp[j-1][t] + dp[j-1][t-ai]

Implement memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary as you solve them.

For edge cases:
- If t is less than any element in the set, then there's no way to generate sum t. So, dp[j][t] will be 0 for such t.
- If t is equal to the sum of all elements in the set, then it can only be generated by including all elements.
