===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of finding all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of a subset of the given set, which is similar to the subset sum problem.

Create a memoization dictionary dp where keys are sums and values are lists of sets, representing the subsets of integers that can generate each distinct sum. Initialize dp with empty lists for sums from 0 to the maximum possible sum.

Iterate over all integers in the given set. For each integer, iterate over the current state of dp to find all sums that the current integer can add or subtract from to achieve a new sum. If the new sum is not greater than the maximum possible sum and the list for the new sum is empty, update dp with the new sum and the corresponding set containing the current integer.

Determine the subsets of integers that can generate each distinct sum by iterating over all possible subsets and checking if they achieve the corresponding sum. For each subset, calculate the sum of its elements and check if it exists in dp. If it does, add the subset to the list for that sum; otherwise, skip it.

Return the values of dp as a space-separated list of integers, representing the distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of the given set, in increasing order.
