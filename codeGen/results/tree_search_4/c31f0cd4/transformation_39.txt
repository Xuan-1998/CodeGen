The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the solution to the current problem depends on the solutions to the subproblems of smaller sizes.

State: View the problem as generating all subsets of the given set and compute their sums. For each possible sum, we can determine if it is distinct by checking its presence in a set or array.

State: dp[i][sum] represents the number of ways to generate the sum 'sum' from the first 'i' elements.

Transition relationship: dp[i][sum] is the sum of dp[j][sum-k] for all 0 <= k <= sum and 1 <= j < i, but with a twist. We only need to consider subsets that include the current element 'a_i'. This can be achieved by considering all possible sums that can be generated from the first 'i-1' elements and subtracting each of them by 'a_i'.

Implement memoization by storing the intermediate results in a dictionary, where the key is the current state (i, sum) and the value is the corresponding solution.

State: A set 'distinct_sums' stores all distinct sums generated from the subsets. For each possible sum 'sum', check if it's already present in 'distinct_sums'. If not, add it to 'distinct_sums'.

Edge cases: The problem statement guarantees that 1 <= N <= 100 and 1 <= ai <= 100. This ensures that our solution will work correctly for all inputs within the given constraints.
