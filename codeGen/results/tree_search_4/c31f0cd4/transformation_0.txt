Task: Given a set of integers, find all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of the given set.

===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of finding all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of a subset of the given set.
The state expression could be dp[i][s] = whether s can be generated from subsets of {a1, a2, ..., ai}
dp[i][s] = whether there exists a subset of {a1, a2, ..., ai} whose sum is equal to s, with dp[j][t] being the base case for all j < i and t
Dynamic Programming using a 2D DP table where dp[i][s] represents whether there exists a subset of {a1, a2, ..., ai} whose sum is equal to s.
For each state, consider including or excluding the current element (ai) in the subset. This would lead to two recursive cases: 
dp[i-1][s-ai] and dp[i-1][s]
The base case for this DP problem would be when i = 0 or s = 0, as there are no more elements to include in the subset or no more sums to consider.
Finally, iterate over the DP table from (0,0) to (N,sum) and print out the distinct sums that have been marked as true in the DP table.
