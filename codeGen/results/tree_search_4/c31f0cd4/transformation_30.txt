===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the solution to the current problem depends on the solutions to the subproblems of smaller sizes.

State: Think about the dynamic programming table dp[i][j] where i ranges from 1 to N and j ranges from 0 to sum all elements. The value at dp[i][j] represents whether there exists a subset that sums up to j using the first i elements.
dp[i][j] = True if there exists a subset of the first i numbers that sums up to j, False otherwise.

Initialize dp[0][0] to True, as an empty set can always sum up to 0. Then for each i from 1 to N and each j from 0 to sum all elements:
    If the current number is less than or equal to j, update dp[i][j] based on whether there exists a subset that sums up to j-i using the first i-1 numbers.
    Use a set called 'seen' to keep track of previously computed sums and avoid redundant calculations.

Fill in the remaining cells from right to left. Start with the largest possible sum (i.e., the sum of all elements) and fill in dp[N][j] for each j.
When you reach the cell dp[i][j], if there exists a subset that sums up to j using the first i numbers, update 'seen' with this new sum.

Finally, iterate over 'seen' to generate the list of distinct sums. This should include all possible subsets and their corresponding sums.
