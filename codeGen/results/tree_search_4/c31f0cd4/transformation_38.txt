===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the solution to the current problem depends on the solutions to the subproblems of smaller sizes.

State: View the problem as generating all subsets of the given set and compute their sums. For each possible sum, we can determine if it is distinct by checking its presence in a set or array.
State: Let dp[i][sum] represents the number of ways to generate the sum 'sum' from the first 'i' elements. Transition relationship: dp[i][sum] is the sum of dp[j][sum-k] for all 0 <= k <= sum and 1 <= j < i.

Sort the input array a in ascending order.
For each sum from 1 to total_sum (the sum of all elements in the given set):
    Initialize dp[0][sum] = 0
    For i from 1 to N:
        For k from sum down to 0:
            If k <= a_i:
                dp[i][k] += dp[i-1][k-a_i]
    Update uniqueSums with sums not yet seen.
For each sum in the dynamic programming table:
    If sum is not present in uniqueSums:
        Add sum to the output list.
