===BEGIN PLAN===
DP_state = (i, j), where i is the current subset and j is the current sum
Initialize DP_state with base case being DP_state(0, 0) returning a list containing 0 as there's no subsets to generate sums for
Define function dp(i, j):
    if i == N: return [j]
    result = []
    for k in range(a[i], j+1):
        if not any(k in subset for subset in DP_state): # Check if k is not already included in previous subsets' sums
            result.extend(dp(i+1, k) + dp(i+1, j-k))
    return [j] + sorted(list(set(result)))
DP_state = dp(0, sum(a))
Return the list of distinct sums from DP_state
