===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of finding all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of a subset of the given set, which is similar to the subset sum problem.

The state expression could be dp[i][s] = whether s can be generated from subsets of {a1, a2, ..., ai}
dp[i][s] = whether there exists a subset of {a1, a2, ..., ai} whose sum is equal to s

Memoization using a dictionary where the key is the state and the value is the result. 

For each number in the set, iterate through all possible subsets of previous numbers and calculate their sums.
If the calculated sum equals the target sum or is already present in the memoized dictionary, add it to the result.

Finally, return the set of unique sums found.
