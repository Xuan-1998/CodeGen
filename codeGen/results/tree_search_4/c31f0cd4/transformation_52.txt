DP_state = (i, s), where i is the current integer and s is the current sum, with base case being DP_state(N+1, s) returning an empty list for any sum beyond N integers
    * Initialize a dictionary to store results of subproblems: memo = {}
DP_state = (i, s, sums), where i is the current integer, s is the current sum, and sums is a list of all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of given set
    * Base case: DP_state(N+1, s) returns an empty list for any sum beyond N integers
    * Recursive case:
        + If i > 0, consider including the current integer ai in the subset and add ai to the current sum
            * Check if the result is already stored in memo, if so return the stored value
            * Otherwise, recursively call DP_state(i-1, s+ai) and store the result in memo
        + If i > 0, consider excluding the current integer ai from the subset and keep the current sum unchanged
            * Check if the result is already stored in memo, if so return the stored value
            * Otherwise, recursively call DP_state(i-1, s) and store the result in memo
    * Combine all possible sums generated by including or excluding each integer in the set
    * Return a sorted list of distinct sums
