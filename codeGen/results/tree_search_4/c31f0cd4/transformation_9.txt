===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of finding all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of a subset of the given set.

Let's define dp[i][t] as the number of ways to generate sum t using elements up to ai. We initialize dp[0][0] = 1, since there is exactly one way to generate sum 0 (by not including any elements).

For each element ai and each possible sum t:
- If ai > t, we don't need to consider this element for the current sum, so we have the same number of ways as before: dp[i][t] = dp[i - 1][t].
- If ai <= t, we can include or not include this element. If we include it, we get a new sum of t - ai, and if we don't include it, we keep the original sum t. We add these two cases to get: dp[i][t] = dp[i - 1][t - ai] + dp[i - 1][t].

Finally, we iterate over all possible sums from 0 to the maximum possible sum and print out those that are present in our dynamic programming array.
