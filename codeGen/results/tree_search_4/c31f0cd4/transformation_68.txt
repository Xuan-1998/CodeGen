===BEGIN PLAN===
DP_state = (subsets, sums), where subsets is a set of all possible subsets and sums is a set of all possible sums, with base case being DP_state({set()}, {0})
Store the current state of subsets and sums as a dictionary where keys are subset indices.
Initialize an empty set to store unique sums
For each integer ai in the input set:
    For each subset_index from 1 to N (inclusive):
        Calculate the sum of elements in the current subset
        If the calculated sum is not already in the DP_state, add it to the DP_state
    Initialize sums as an empty set
    Add all distinct sums from the DP_state into the sets
Return a space-separated list of integers representing the unique sums in increasing order.
