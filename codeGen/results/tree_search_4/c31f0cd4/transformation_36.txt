===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the solution to the current problem depends on the solutions to the subproblems of smaller sizes.

State: View the problem as generating all subsets of the given set and compute their sums. For each possible sum, we can determine if it is distinct by checking its presence in a set or array.
State: dp[i][j] represents the subset sums from 0 to j using only numbers from 1 to i. Transition relationship: dp[i][j] is the sum of all possible subsets from 1 to i that have a sum equal to j.

Implement memoization by defining a function get_sum(i, j) that returns the number of subsets with sum j using numbers from 1 to i. Initialize an empty dictionary dp to store the dynamic programming table values.
Fill up the dp table by iterating through all possible sums and subsets: for each j, compute the number of subsets with sum j using numbers from 1 to i.
