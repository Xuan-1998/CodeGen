===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of finding all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of a subset of the given set, which is similar to the subset sum problem.

The state expression could be:
dp[i][j] = 1 if ai is included in the subset (add 1 if ai <= j), and
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] otherwise

This means that for each element ai, we have two options: either include it in the subset or not. If we include it and ai <= j, then we add 1 to the number of ways to generate sum j using elements up to ai-1. Otherwise, we simply consider the subsets of ai-1.

Dynamic programming approach by building a 2D table where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to generate sum j using elements up to ai:

    Initialize dp[0][i] = 1 for all i (base case: empty set generates only one subset, which is the empty set itself)
    For each element ai:
        For each possible sum j from 0 to sum of all elements:
            If ai <= j, then add 1 to dp[i-1][j-ai] (include ai in the subset and subtract its value from j)
            Otherwise, just copy the result from dp[i-1][j]
    Print out all distinct sums that can be generated using the subsets of the given set
