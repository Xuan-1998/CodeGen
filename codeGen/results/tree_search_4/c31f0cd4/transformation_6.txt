===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of finding all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of a subset of the given set.

Let dp[i][j] represent the number of ways to generate sum i using elements from 1 to j. The state transition equation could be:
dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] (no change)
          + dp[i-a[j]][j-1] for all a[j] in the set
This is because either you include aj in the subset and add its value to i, or you don't include it.

The base case would be when i = 0, which means we are generating the sum 0. In this case, dp[0][j] would always be 1, since there is only one way to generate a sum of 0 (by not including any elements).

The problem can also be solved by using a hash map to store the distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of the given set.

Let's use a set to store the distinct sums. For each number in the input array, we add it to all previous numbers and calculate their sum. If this sum is not in the set, we add it.

At the end, we convert the set back into an array and sort it to get the final answer.
