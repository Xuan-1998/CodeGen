DP_state = (subsets, sums), where subsets is a set of all possible subsets and sums is a set of all possible sums, with base case being DP_state({set()}, {0})
DP_state = (subset_index, subset_sum), where subset_index is the index of the current subset in the original set and subset_sum is the sum of elements in the subset.
Memoize dynamic programming states by storing subsets and sums as (subsets, sums) tuples.

Initialize a dictionary dp to store memoized DP_states.
For each number ai in the input set:
  For i = 0 to N-1:
    Generate all possible subsets of {a0, a1, ..., ai} and calculate their sums.
    Store these subsets and sums in dp as (subsets, sums) tuples.

To generate the distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of the given set:
  Initialize an empty list result to store the unique sums.
  For each DP_state (subset_index, subset_sum) in dp:
    If subset_sum is not already in result:
      Add subset_sum to result.
  Sort result in ascending order.

Return result as the output.
