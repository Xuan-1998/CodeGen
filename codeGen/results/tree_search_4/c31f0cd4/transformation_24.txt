===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the solution to the current problem depends on the solutions to the subproblems of smaller sizes.

State: Consider the subset sums for each subset size from 0 to N, where N is the total number of elements in the set. The state would be a tuple (subset_size, current_sum).

Transition function: dp[j] represents the subset sums for each subset size j, where 0 <= j <= N and N is the total number of elements in the set. The transition function would be:

- Initialize dp[0] with {0} (the sum for an empty set is 0)
- For each element i in the set:
    - Iterate over all possible subset sizes k from 1 to N
    - Calculate the new sum by adding the current element i to the sums in dp[k-1]
    - Add this new sum to the corresponding entry in dp[k] if it's not already there
- Return the union of all entries in dp from 0 to N

Memoization: Use a dictionary memo = {i: set() for i in range(N+1)} to store the subset sums for each subset size, and update it accordingly during the transition function.
