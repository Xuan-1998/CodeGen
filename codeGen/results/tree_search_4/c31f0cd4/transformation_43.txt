===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization can be used by storing the results of subproblems as they are computed and checking if the result for a subproblem already exists before computing it.

DP_state = (i, s), where i is the current subset and s is the current sum, with base case being DP_state(N, 0) returning a list of sums for the complete set

dp(i, j) function that calculates all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of ai, ..., aj:
    1. Initialize an empty set dp_set to store unique sums
    2. Iterate over the given integers from ai to aj
        a. For each integer, calculate the new sums by adding this integer to existing sums in dp_set
        b. Add these new sums to dp_set and remove duplicates
    3. Return dp_set as the result
