===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization can be used by storing the results of subproblems as they are computed and checking if the result for a subproblem already exists before computing it.

DP_state = (subsets, sums), where subsets is a set of all possible subsets and sums is a set of all possible sums.
The base case would be DP_state({set()}, {0}), since we start with an empty subset and a sum of 0. The goal is to find the distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets.

DP_state = (current_subset, current_sum), where current_subset is the current subset being processed and current_sum is the sum of elements in the current subset.
We use a 2D array dp to store the state of the dynamic programming, where each cell represents the sum generated by a subset of the given set. The rows represent different subsets, and the columns represent different sums.

For each subset, we iterate through all possible sums (from 0 to the sum of elements in the subset). If the sum is already present in the dp array, skip it; otherwise, add it to the list of distinct sums.
Finally, return the set of distinct sums.
