===BEGIN PLAN===
DP_state = (dp_subsets, dp_sums)
where dp_subsets is a dictionary mapping subsets to their corresponding sums and
      dp_sums is a set of all possible distinct sums
with base case being DP_state({set()}, {0})
iterate over the given set of integers:
    for each integer ai in the set:
        for every subset subset in dp_subsets:
            add ai to subset and update dp_subsets
            calculate the sum of ai and all elements in subset
            if this new sum is not in dp_sums, add it to dp_sums
    calculate the total sum of the given set
    return a sorted list of unique sums in dp_sums
