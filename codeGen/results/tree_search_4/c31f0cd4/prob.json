"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given a set of integers, find all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of the given set.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of a single line containing an integer N, followed by N integers a1, a2, ..., aN, representing the set of integers. It is guaranteed that 1 <= N <= 100 and 1 <= ai <= 100.\\n\\nOutput: Output a single line containing a space-separated list of integers, representing the distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of the given set, in increasing order.\\n\\nConstraints: The time complexity of the solution should be O(n * sum), where sum is the sum of all elements of the given set. The space complexity of the solution should be O(n * sum).\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Dynamic programming']\", \"difficulties\": \"MEDIUM\", \"source\": \"geeksforgeeks\", \"url\": \"https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-all-distinct-subset-or-subsequence-sums4424/1\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"nums = {1,2}\", \"output\": \"{0,1,2,3}\"}, {\"input\": \"nums = {1,2,3}\", \"output\": \"{0,1,2,3,4,5,6}\"}]}"
