===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the solution to the current problem depends on the solutions to the subproblems of smaller sizes.

State: Consider the subset sums for each subset size from 0 to N, where N is the total number of elements in the set. The state would be a tuple (subset_size, current_sum).

State: dp[i][j][k] represents whether the sum k can be generated by a subset of size j using the first i elements. We can use a dictionary memo as a cache to store the results of subproblems.

For each state (i, j, k), check if it's already in the memo before calculating the value. If not, calculate the value based on the recurrence relation:

dp[i][j][k] = dp[i-1][j-1][k-a_i] OR dp[i-1][j][k]

This is because a subset of size j can either include or exclude the current element (a_i). The base case would be when i, j, and k are all 0.

To generate the distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of the given set, we can iterate through the memo array and print out the keys that have a value of True. We need to ensure that the order is increasing based on the sum values.

Finally, we return the list of distinct sums.
