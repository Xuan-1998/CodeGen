===BEGIN PLAN===
DP_state = (subset, sum), where subset is the current subset and sum is the current sum, with base case being DP_state({}, 0) returning a list of sums for the empty subset
Memoize using a dictionary with DP_state as key and sets of distinct sums as value
Initialize memoization dictionary dp = {}
For each integer i in the input set:
    For each possible subset s of integers less than or equal to i:
        Calculate sum = sum of all integers in subset s
        If sum not in dp, add it with an empty set as its value
        For each possible sum j greater than sum:
            Add j to the set of sums for sum if it is not already there
    Return a list of distinct sums from memoization dictionary dp
