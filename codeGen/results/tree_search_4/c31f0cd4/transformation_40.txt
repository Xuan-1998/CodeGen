===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the solution to the current problem depends on the solutions to the subproblems of smaller sizes.

State: View the problem as generating all subsets of the given set and compute their sums. For each possible sum, we can determine if it is distinct by checking its presence in a set or array.

State: dp[i][j] represents the subsets that have a sum equal to 'j' using only numbers from 1 to 'i'. Transition relationship: dp[i][j] is updated based on whether or not an element is included in the subset. Note that we don't need k, as each sum corresponds to at least one subset.

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the subsets that have a sum equal to 'j' using only numbers from 1 to 'i'. Initialize all elements of the 2D array with False, and then iterate over the given set. For each element, update the corresponding elements in the 2D array based on whether or not it is included in the subset.

To generate the distinct sums, iterate over the 2D array and check for True values. These represent the distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of the given set.
