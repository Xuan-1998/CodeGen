===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the solution to the current problem depends on the solutions to the subproblems of smaller sizes.

State: View the problem as generating all subsets of the given set and compute their sums. For each possible sum, we can determine if it is distinct by checking its presence in a dictionary. The dictionary will be used to keep track of the encountered sums.

State: dp[i][j] represents the sum 'j' generated using only numbers from 1 to 'i'. Transition relationship: dp[i][j] is updated based on whether or not an element is included in the subset.

Use a dictionary dp where keys are sums and values are booleans indicating whether the sum has been encountered before. Initialize all elements of the dictionary with False, and then iterate over the given set. For each element 'k', update the corresponding elements in the dictionary based on whether or not 'k' is included in the subset.

Use a sorted list to store the distinct sums and then print it out.
