===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the solution to the current problem depends on the solutions to the subproblems of smaller sizes.

State: Consider the subset sums for each subset size from 0 to N, where N is the total number of elements in the set. The state would be a tuple (subset_size, current_sum).

Transition: dp[i][j] represents the distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of size j using the first i elements.

Base case: dp[0][j] = {0} for 0 <= j <= N

Memoization: Implement memoization by defining a dictionary to store the results of subproblems as they are computed. This would allow us to avoid redundant computation and reduce the time complexity of our solution.

State transition function: For each i and j, calculate dp[i][j] = (union of dp[i-1][k] for k in range(0, j+1)) âˆª {dp[i-1][j-1] + a[i]} where a[i] is the ith element in the set.

Edge cases: Ensure that we handle edge cases correctly by considering subsets of size 0 and N. This would involve updating our base case and transition function accordingly.

State space complexity: The state space complexity is O(N * sum), where sum is the sum of all elements in the given set, as each entry in the dp array represents a distinct subset sum.

Time complexity: The time complexity is also O(N * sum) as we are essentially computing the distinct subset sums for each possible subset size and element.
