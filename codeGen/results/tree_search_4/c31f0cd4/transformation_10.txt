===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of finding all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of a subset of the given set, which is similar to the subset sum problem.

Let's define dp[i][t] = 1 if there exists a subset with elements up to ai such that the sum of its elements equals t, and 0 otherwise. We'll use this definition to build our state expression.

To solve this problem efficiently, we can implement memoization by creating a dictionary mem, where mem[t] stores the minimum number of subsets required to generate a subset sum equal to t.

Here's the updated plan:
