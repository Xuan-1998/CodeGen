===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of finding all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of a subset of the given set, which is similar to the subset sum problem.

The state expression could be memoization dictionary where keys are sums and values are boolean indicating if the sum is achievable

A dynamic programming table with rows for subsets (represented as binary numbers) and columns for sums, where each cell stores a boolean indicating if the sum is achievable from the corresponding subset.

Create a dynamic programming table dp of size (2^n x sum), where n is the number of elements in the given set. Initialize all cells to False

Iterate over the subsets:

    Convert the subset into binary representation and iterate over its bits:
    
        For each bit, calculate the current sum by adding the corresponding element from the original set to the previous sum (if any)
        
        Check if the calculated sum is achievable in the dp table
        If yes, mark it as True in the dp table

Output all sums that are achievable and their values in the dp table
