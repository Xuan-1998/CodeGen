===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of finding all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of a subset of the given set, which is similar to the subset sum problem.

Create a memoization dictionary dp with keys as integers representing possible sums and values as lists of sets. Each set in the list represents a subset of integers that generates the corresponding sum.

1. Initialize dp with all possible sums.
2. Iterate over each number in the given set.
   - For each number, iterate over the current dp state (all possible sums).
     - If the sum plus the current number is within the bounds of the problem and it's not already present in the dp state, add it to the dp state with a new set that includes the current number.
3. The final result will be all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of the given set.
