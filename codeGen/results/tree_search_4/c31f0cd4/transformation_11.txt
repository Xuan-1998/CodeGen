===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of finding all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of a subset of the given set, which is similar to the subset sum problem.

Let dp[i][t] represent the number of ways to generate sum t using elements up to ai. We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.

The state transition equation could be:

dp[i][t] = dp[i-1][t] + (1 if aj <= t else 0)

This is because we either include or exclude aj in the subset, and update the sum accordingly.

To make sure that all distinct sums are generated, we need to include a dictionary memo to store the intermediate results. The state expression could be:

dp = {}
for i in range(1, N+1):
    for t in range(sum + 1):
        dp[i][t] = dp[i-1].get(t, 0) + (1 if ai <= t else 0)

Finally, we can generate the distinct sums by iterating over the dictionary and printing out the keys.
