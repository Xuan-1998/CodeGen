===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of finding all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of a subset of the given set, which is similar to the subset sum problem.

The state expression could be memoization dictionary where keys are sums and values are boolean indicating if the sum is achievable

A dynamic programming table with rows for subsets (represented by binary numbers) and columns for sums, where each cell stores a boolean indicating if the sum is achievable from the corresponding subset. The DP table can be initialized as follows:
    - All cells in the first row (representing the empty subset) are set to False, except for the cell representing the sum of 0, which is set to True
    - All cells in the first column (representing sums from 0) are set to True

Implement a recursive function that uses memoization to store the results of subproblems. The function takes three parameters: the current subset represented as a binary number, the current sum, and the memoization dictionary.

Use this function to compute all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of the given set by:
    - Iterating through the DP table row by row
    - For each cell, if the value is True, it means the sum is achievable, so add it to the result list
    - If the current subset has more elements than the previous subset, generate all possible binary numbers representing subsets of the new subset and recursively call the function
