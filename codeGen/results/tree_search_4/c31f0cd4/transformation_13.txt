===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of finding all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of a subset of the given set, which is similar to the subset sum problem.

Create a memoization dictionary dp with sums as keys and sets as values, where each set represents the subset of integers that can generate the corresponding sum. Initialize dp with zeros for all sums and an empty set for each sum.

Create a dynamic programming table achievable with boolean values indicating if each sum is achievable.

Initialize the base case by setting dp[0] to {[]} (the empty set) since the sum 0 can always be achieved by not including any elements from the given set.

For each integer ai in the given set, iterate through all sums in dp and for each sum:
    If the current sum is achievable (i.e., the corresponding value in achievable is True), add ai to each set that generates this sum.
    Update the sets in dp with the new subsets that include ai.
    For each subset s in dp, update the corresponding value in achievable if the sum of the elements in s plus ai is also achievable.

Finally, construct the subsets for all sums in dp and return them as the result. This can be done by iterating through the sorted sums and for each sum:
    If the set that generates this sum is not empty, add it to the result.
    Otherwise, there are no subsets that generate this sum, so skip it.
