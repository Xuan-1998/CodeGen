===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the solution to the current problem depends on the solutions to the subproblems of smaller sizes.

State: dp[i][j][k] represents whether the sum k can be generated by a subset of size j using the first i elements. The state would be a 3D array where dp[i][j][k] is either True or False. Initialize all values in the 3D array to False.

For each element ai from left to right:
    For each possible sum k from 0 to sum:
        If k == 0, set dp[i][0][k] to True
        For j from 1 to i:
            If dp[i-1][j-1][k-a_i] is True, set dp[i][j][k] to True

Return all possible sums that are marked as True in the 3D array.
