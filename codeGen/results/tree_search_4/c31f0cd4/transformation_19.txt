===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of finding all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of a subset of the given set, which is similar to the subset sum problem.

The state expression could be a dictionary where keys are tuples representing a sum and an index in the input array, and values are boolean indicating if the sum is achievable at that point. This would allow us to memoize the results for faster lookups.

A hash map with sums as keys and lists of subsets as values, where each list contains the subsets that can generate the corresponding sum.

Use a dictionary to store the memoized results for faster lookups.
For each number in the input array:
  Initialize an empty set to store the unique sums
  For each subset of the remaining numbers (recursively):
    Calculate the sum of the current subset
    If this sum is not yet stored in the result set, add it and update the memoized dictionary accordingly
  Sort the resulting set of unique sums and return them
