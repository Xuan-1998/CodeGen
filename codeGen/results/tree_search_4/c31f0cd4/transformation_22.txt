===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the solution to the current problem depends on the solutions to the subproblems of smaller sizes.

State: Consider the subset sums for each subset size from 0 to N, where N is the total number of elements in the set. The state would be a tuple (subset_size, current_sum).
dp = [[set() for _ in range(N+1)] for _ in range(N+1)];

Function: dp[i][j] represents the distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of size i and sum j.
1. Initialize dp[0][0] to {0} (base case)
2. For each subset_size i from 1 to N:
   a. For each current_sum j in range(subset_size, subset_size + 100):
      i. If j is not already in dp[i-1][j], add it
3. Flatten the dp array into a single list and sort it.
