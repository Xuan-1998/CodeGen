===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: Compare all possible substrings of str1 and str2, considering their lengths from 1 to N. Optimal substructure: Find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings by recursively combining smaller substrings.

The state could be defined as dp[i][k] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position i in str1 and length k.

For each substring of length k from 1 to N:
    Initialize a dictionary dp[k] with values from 0 to N.
    Iterate through str1 and str2, considering all substrings of length k that end at the current position.
        Update dp[k] to be the maximum value between its previous value and the count of matching substrings ending at this position.
Return dp[N]
