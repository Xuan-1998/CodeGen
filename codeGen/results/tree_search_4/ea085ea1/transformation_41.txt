===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is characterized by finding the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between two strings. This problem can be solved using memoization in a top-down approach, as it has overlapping subproblems.

To improve this plan, we can start by creating a 2D array dp of size N x N to store the dynamic programming state. Initialize all values to -1, where N is the length of each input string.

The transition relationship can be formulated as: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 if str1[i-1] == str2[j-1] else 0, dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

For each pair of characters at positions i and j, check if they are equal. If yes, update dp[i][j] as max(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1, dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]), otherwise set it to max(0, dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]).

To find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1 and str2, we can start from the top-right corner of the dp array and move downwards. The maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings is stored in the bottom-left corner of the dp array.

Finally, iterate through the dp array to count the number of cells that store a value greater than 0. This represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1 and str2.
