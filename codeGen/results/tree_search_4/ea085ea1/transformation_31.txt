===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: Compare all possible substrings of str1 and str2, considering their lengths from 1 to N.
Optimal substructure: Find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings by recursively combining smaller substrings.
The state could be defined as dp[i][k] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position i in str1 and length k, and similarly for str2 as dp[j][k].
max_num = max(dp[N-1][i] for i in range(len(str2)))
Implement dynamic programming using a bottom-up approach, starting from the base case where k = 1.
Initialize a table with dimensions N x (N+1), then recursively fill the table by considering all possible substrings of str1 and str2.
For each cell dp[i][k], consider all possible substrings of length k ending at position i in either str1 or str2, and update the value accordingly.
Edge cases: Handle the case where k = 0 (i.e., empty substring) by considering it a special case that always contributes to the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings.
