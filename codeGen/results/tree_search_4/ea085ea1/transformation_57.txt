===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify state variables: Let dp[i][j] be the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i and j in str1 and str2 respectively. The base case is when i or j is 0.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) if i > 0 and j > 0, 0 if i == 0 or j == 0

Let a dictionary store the dynamic programming values for memoization
Create an empty dictionary, say memo, to store the computed dp[i][j] values

Initialize dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] as 0 for all i in range(N) and j in range(N)

For each pair (i, j), compute dp[i][j]

If str1[i-1] is equal to str2[j-1], update dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1

else, update dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

Return the maximum value in the last row of the dp table (i.e., dp[N-1][j]) as the result
