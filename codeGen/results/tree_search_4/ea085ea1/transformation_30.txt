===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: Compare all possible substrings of str1 and str2, considering their lengths from 1 to N. 
Optimal substructure: Find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings by recursively combining smaller substrings.

The state could be defined as dp[i][j] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position i in str1 and j in str2.
max_num = max(dp[N-1][i] for i in range(len(str2)))
dp[0][0] = 0

For each substring length k from 1 to N:
    For each substring start index i in str1 from 0 to N-k:
        For each substring start index j in str2 from 0 to N-k:
            dp[i][j] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position i in str1 and j in str2
            if the current k-length substring is present in both str1 and str2: 
                add 1 to the count of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position i in str1 and j in str2

Use memoization to store the results of subproblems in a dictionary, mapping (i, j) tuples to the corresponding dp values. This way, you can avoid redundant computations and speed up your solution.
