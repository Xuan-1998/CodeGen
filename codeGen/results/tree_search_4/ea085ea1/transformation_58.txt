===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify state variables: Let dp[i][j] be the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i and j in str1 and str2 respectively. The base case is when i or j is 0.

dp[0][j] = 0 for all j
dp[i][0] = 0 for all i

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) if str1[i-1] == str2[j-1]
dp[i][j] = 0 if str1[i-1] != str2[j-1]

Dynamically create a table with the same dimensions as the input strings
fill the table row by row, starting from the top and moving right
for each cell, check if the current characters in both strings are equal. If they are, 
update the cell's value to be one plus the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at the previous position.
if the current characters are not equal, update the cell's value to be the maximum of the values for the cell above and to its left
