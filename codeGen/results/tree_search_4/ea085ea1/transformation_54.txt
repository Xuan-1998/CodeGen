===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify state variables: Let dp[i][j] be the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i and j in str1 and str2 respectively. The base case is when i or j is 0.
dp[i][j] = 1 if str1[i-1] == str2[j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]; else, max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
Use memoization by creating a dictionary to store the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at each pair of indices in str1 and str2.
