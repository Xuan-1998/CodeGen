===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is characterized by finding the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between two strings. This problem can be solved using memoization in a top-down approach, as it has overlapping subproblems.

The longest common prefix of two substrings from str1 and str2 that end at positions i and j, respectively.

Initialize a 3D DP table dp[i][j][k] to represent the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at positions i and j in str1, and k characters being matched so far between str1 and str2.

Memoize dp[i][j][k] values for each position (i,j) in the strings and each number of matching characters k. For a given pair of positions (i, j), check if the substrings ending at i and j are common and non-overlapping. If they are, update the dp value.

To determine if two substrings are common and non-overlapping, compare the substrings ending at i and j in str1 with those ending at i-1 and j-1 (if i>0 and j>0) or i+1 and j+1 (if i<N-1 and j<N-1). If they match and do not overlap, increment the dp value.

For edge cases, consider strings of length 1. In this case, there are no non-overlapping substrings as there is only one character. For strings of length 0, return 0 as there are no characters to compare.
