===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is characterized by finding the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between two strings. This problem can be solved using memoization in a top-down approach, as it has overlapping subproblems.

1. Initialize a 3D DP table dp[i][j][k] to represent the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at positions i and j in str1, and k characters being matched so far between str1 and str2.
   For each character in the strings, we can calculate the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings that end at this position.

2. Create a 3D DP table where dp[i][j][k] stores the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at positions i and j in str1 and k matching characters between str1 and str2
