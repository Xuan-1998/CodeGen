===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is characterized by finding the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between two strings. This problem can be solved using memoization in a top-down approach, as it has overlapping subproblems.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider not only the longest common prefix but also whether there are any common substrings that do not share their last characters.
Formulate the state and transition relationships using a 3D DP table where dp[i][j][k] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at positions i in str1, j in str2, and k (the length of the current substring) is bounded by [0, min(i+1, j+1)].
Use memoization by storing the intermediate results of dynamic programming in a dictionary where the key is the current state and the value is the computed result.

For each position i in str1 and j in str2, we need to consider all possible lengths of substrings ending at these positions. For each length k, check if there are common non-overlapping substrings that end at positions i and j with the same substring length k.
If so, update dp[i][j][k] accordingly.
Finally, return dp[0][0][-1], which represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1 and str2.
