===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i][j] be the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i and j in str1 and str2 respectively.

Initialize memo with zeros: Create a 2D array memo of size N*N, where memo[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i and j in str1 and str2 respectively. Initialize all elements to 0.

Base case: When i or j is 0, there are no substrings.
dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 0

Transition rule: 
- If str1[0..i] matches with str2[0..j], then consider the substring ending at indices i and j. Add this to the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i-1 and j-1.
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + (str1[0..i] == str2[0..j])

Iterate over all pairs of indices: Fill up memo array using the transition rule. The maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i and j is stored in memo[i][j].

Return the value at the last cell: Return dp[N-1][N-1], which represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1 and str2.
