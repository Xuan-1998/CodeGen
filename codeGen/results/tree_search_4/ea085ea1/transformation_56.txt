===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i][j] be the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i and j in str1 and str2 respectively.

The base case is when i or j is 0, set dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 0 for all i and j

For i > 0 and j > 0:
    If str1[i-1] != str2[j-1], update dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

Else, update dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1

Use a 2D array to store the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at each position in str1 and str2

Let max_count be 0
For i from 1 to N:
    For j from 1 to N:
        Update max_count = max(max_count, dp[i][j])

Return max_count
