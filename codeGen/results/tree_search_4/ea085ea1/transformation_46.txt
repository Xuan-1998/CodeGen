===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify state variables: Let dp[i][j] be the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i and j in str1 and str2 respectively. The base case is when i or j is 0.

dp[0][0] = 0
For each pair (i, j), calculate dp[i][j] as:
dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1] if str1[i] == str2[j]
else, let the maximum length of common prefix be k, then:
dp[i][j] = dp[k][k]

Implement dynamic programming using recursive function calls with memoization.
The final answer is dp[N-1][N-1], where N is the length of each string.
