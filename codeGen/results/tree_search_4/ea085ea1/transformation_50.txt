===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify state variables: Let dp[i][j] be the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i and j in str1 and str2 respectively.

dp[0][0] = 0
for i from 1 to N:
    for j from 1 to N:
        if str1[i-1] == str2[j-1]:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
        else:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

Create a variable max_count to keep track of the maximum count of common non-overlapping substrings found so far.
max_count = 0
for i from 1 to N:
    for j from 1 to N:
        if dp[i][j] > max_count:
            max_count = dp[i][j]

Return the value of max_count as the result.
