===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify state variables: Let dp[i][j] be the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i and j in str1 and str2 respectively. The base case is when i or j is 0.
dp[0][0] = 1 if str1[0] == str2[0], 0 otherwise
For i > 0, dp[i][0] = 0 and similarly for j > 0, dp[0][j] = 0
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 if str1[i] == str2[j]
Initialize a table with zeros, then fill it up based on the problem's constraints.
For i from N-1 down to 1 and j from N-1 down to 1:
    If str1[i] == str2[j]:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
    Else:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
Return dp[N-1][N-1]
