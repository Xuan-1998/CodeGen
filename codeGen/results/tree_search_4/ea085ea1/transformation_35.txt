===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is characterized by finding the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between two strings. This problem can be solved using dynamic programming in a bottom-up approach.

Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j].
The transition relationship can be formulated as:

* If str1[:i] and str2[:j] have a common prefix, then dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]
* Otherwise, dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], and 0

Use a 2D array to store the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between two strings and fill it up using the transition relationship.

Initialize dp[0][0] = 0.
Iterate over i from 1 to N:
    Iterate over j from 1 to N:
        If str1[i-1] == str2[j-1], then update dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]
        Otherwise, update dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], 0)

Return dp[N][N]
