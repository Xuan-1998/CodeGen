===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify state variables: Let dp[i][j] be the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i and j in str1 and str2 respectively. The base case is when i or j is 0.

dp[0][0] = 0
for i from 1 to N:
    for j from 1 to N:
        if str1[i-1] == str2[j-1]:
            dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]
        else:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
