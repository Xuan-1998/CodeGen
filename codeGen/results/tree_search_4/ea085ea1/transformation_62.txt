===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify state variables: Let dp[i][j] be the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i and j in str1 and str2 respectively. The base case is when i or j is 0.

dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 0
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] if str1[i] == str2[j]
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1] - dp[i-1][j-1] if str1[i] != str2[j]

Use a dictionary to store previously computed values and look them up when needed.
