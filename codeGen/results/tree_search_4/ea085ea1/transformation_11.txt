===BEGIN PLAN===
Create a 2D array dp of size (N+1) x (N+1) and fill it with zeros to store the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings.

Initialize dp[0][k] = 0 for all k in range(N+1), since there are no substrings ending at position 0.

For each i in range(1, N+1):
    For each k in range(min(i, N)):
        If str1[i-k:i+1] == str2[i-k:i+1]:
            dp[i][k] = max(dp[i][k], dp[i-k][k-1] + 1)

Return the maximum value in the last column of the dp array, which represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings.
