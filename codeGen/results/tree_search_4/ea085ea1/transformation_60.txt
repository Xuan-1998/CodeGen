===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify state variables: Let dp[i][j] be the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i and j in str1 and str2 respectively. The base case is when i or j is 0.

dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 0 for all i, j
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) if i > 0 and j > 0

Use a dictionary to store the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for each pair of strings as keys and their corresponding values.

Update dp[i][j] accordingly:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) if str1[i] == str2[j]
dp[i][j] = 0 if i > 0 and j == 0 or i == 0 and j > 0

Fill up the table in a bottom-up manner, starting from dp[0][0].
