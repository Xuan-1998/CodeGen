===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: Compare all possible substrings of str1 and str2, considering their lengths from 1 to N. Optimal substructure: Find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings by recursively combining smaller substrings.

The state could be defined as dp[i][k] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position i in str1 and length k.
dp[i][k] = max(dp[i-1][k-1] + 1 if str1[i-k:i+1] exists in str2, 0) 
dp = [[0]*(N+1) for _ in range(N+1)],

Initialize dp[0][0] to 0.
For each character i in str1 (from left to right), update dp[i][k] by iterating through lengths k from N down to 1:
    If the current substring str1[i-k:i+1] exists in str2, update dp[i][k] as the maximum of its current value and dp[i-1][k-1] + 1.
    Else, keep dp[i][k] unchanged.

The maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings is stored in dp[N][N].
