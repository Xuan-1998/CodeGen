===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: Compare all possible substrings of str1 and str2, considering their lengths from 1 to N. Optimal substructure: Find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings by recursively combining smaller substrings.

The state could be defined as dp[i][j] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j].

dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. If str1[i-1] == str2[j-1], then dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]; else, dp[i][j] is the maximum of the following: 0 (no common substring), or max(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j]), or dp[i][j-1].

Implement tabulation by initializing a 2D array dp of size N x N and filling it up based on the recurrence relation. Before returning the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings, we need to consider edge cases such as when str1 is a substring of str2 or vice versa.
