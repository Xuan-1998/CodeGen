===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: Compare all possible substrings of str1 and str2, considering their lengths from 1 to N. Optimal substructure: Find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings by recursively combining smaller substrings.

The state could be defined as dp[i][j] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position i in str1 and position j in str2.
dp[i][k] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:k].

Implement memoization using a dictionary where the key is a tuple (i, k) representing the state and the value is the calculated result.

Iterate through str1 and str2 to fill in dp values. For each pair (i, j), check if there's a common substring of length 1 between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. If found, update dp[i][k].

To avoid recalculating the same subproblem multiple times, use memoization to store previously computed results.

For edge cases, handle the case when i or j is 0 (initial states) by setting dp[0][k] = dp[k][0] = 0 for all k.
