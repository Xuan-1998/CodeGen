===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: Compare all possible substrings of str1 and str2, considering their lengths from 1 to N. Optimal substructure: Find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings by recursively combining smaller substrings.

The state could be defined as dp[j][k] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position j in str2 and length k.
dp[i][j] = 
    max(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(j)) if str1[i-1] != str2[j-1],
    dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 if str1[i-1] == str2[j-1].

Use a dictionary to memoize the values computed during the dynamic programming process, where the keys are tuples representing the current position in str2 and its length, and the values are the corresponding maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings.

Initialize dp with zeros for all positions j and lengths k.
For i from 1 to N:
    For j from 1 to N:
        If str1[i-1] == str2[j-1]:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
        Else:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(j))
Return the value at dp[N][N] as the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings.
