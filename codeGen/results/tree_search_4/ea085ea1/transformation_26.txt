===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: Compare all possible substrings of str1 and str2, considering their lengths from 1 to N. Optimal substructure: Find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings by recursively combining smaller substrings.

The state could be defined as dp[j][k] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position j in str2 and length k.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(j)) if str1[i-1] != str2[j-1], dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 if str1[i-1] == str2[j-1].

Create a 2D table with dimensions N x (N+1) to store the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at each position in str2 and for each length from 0 to N.

Initialize dp[0][k] = 0 for all k, since there are no substrings of length 0.

Fill up the dp table by iterating over i from 1 to N and j from 0 to N. For each pair (i, j), compute dp[i][j] based on the values in the previous rows and columns.

Finally, return the maximum value in the last column of the dp table, which represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1 and str2.
