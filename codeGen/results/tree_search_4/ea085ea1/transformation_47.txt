Identify state variables: Let dp[i][j] be the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i and j in str1 and str2 respectively. The base case is when i or j is 0.

dp[0][0] = 0
dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] if str1[i] == str2[0]
dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] if str2[j] == str2[0]

for i from 1 to N:
    for j from 1 to N:
        if str1[i] == str2[j]:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
        else:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

Return dp[N-1][N-1]
