The optimal substructure is characterized by finding the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between two strings. This problem can be solved using memoization in a top-down approach, as it has overlapping subproblems.

The longest common prefix of two substrings from str1 and str2 that end at positions i and j, respectively.

Formulate the state and transition relationships using a 3D DP table where dp[i][j][k] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at positions i in str1, j in str2, and k is the length of the current common substring. This is because we need to consider the different lengths of the common substrings.

Create a 3D DP table to store the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for each prefix of str1 and str2.

The base case would be when i or j is less than 0, in which case dp[i][j][k] = 0. This is because there are no substrings ending at positions i in str1 and j in str2.

For the transition relationship, we need to consider all possible lengths of common substrings that end at positions i in str1 and j in str2. We can do this by iterating over k from 1 to min(i+1, j+1) (since the maximum length of a substring ending at position i in str1 or j in str2 is i+1 or j+1 respectively).

For each value of k, we need to check if the current characters at positions i-k+1 in str1 and j-k+1 in str2 are equal. If they are, then we can consider this common substring of length k.

The maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at positions i in str1 and j in str2 would be the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at positions i-1 in str1 and j-1 in str2 plus 1 if the current characters match, otherwise it's the same as the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at positions i-1 in str1 and j-1 in str2.

The final answer would be dp[0][0][0], which represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for the entire strings str1 and str2.
