===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: Compare all possible substrings of str1 and str2, considering their lengths from 1 to N. Optimal substructure: Find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings by recursively combining smaller substrings.

The state could be defined as dp[i][j] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j].
dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. 
If str1[i-1] == str2[j-1], then dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]; else, dp[i][j] is the minimum of the following: N (all strings are common), or min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j]), or dp[i][j-1].

Create a 2D array to store the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. Initialize dp[0][0] = 0, and fill the rest of the array using the given recurrence relation.
If the strings are shorter than N, adjust the recurrence relation accordingly.

Fill in the bottom row first (dp[N-1][j]) for j = 0 to N-1. Then fill in each subsequent row.
The final answer is dp[N-1][N-1].
