===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: Compare all possible substrings of str1 and str2, considering their lengths from 1 to N. Optimal substructure: Find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings by recursively combining smaller substrings.

The state could be defined as dp[i][j] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position i in str1 and j in str2.
dp[0][k] or dp[i][0] is 0 for all i, k because there are no substrings of length 0.

For 1 ≤ i ≤ N and 1 ≤ j ≤ M, dp[i][j] = 1 if str1[i-1] equals str2[j-1], otherwise it's the maximum of:
    - dp[i-1][k] for k in range(j) (the number of common substrings ending at i-1 in str1 and up to j-1 in str2)
    - 0 if there are no matching characters
dp[N][M] is the result, the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings.

Use memoization with a dictionary to store previously computed values.
Store the results in dp[i][j] based on the comparison of str1[i-1] and str2[j-1].
