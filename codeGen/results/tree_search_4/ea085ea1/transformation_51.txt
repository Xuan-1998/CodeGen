===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify state variables: Let dp[i][j] be the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i and j in str1 and str2 respectively. The base case is when i or j is 0.

dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + (str2[j-1] == str1[0]) for all j > 0
dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + (str1[i-1] == str2[0]) for all i > 0

For i, j > 0:
    If str1[i] == str2[j], then there are two possibilities: 
        1. The current substrings are the same and we can extend them.
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + (str1[i] == str2[j])
        2. The current substrings are different, so we start a new substring.
            dp[i][j] = 1
    Else, the current characters don't match and we can't extend the previous substrings.
        dp[i][j] = 0

Use a dictionary memo to store the results of subproblems, where memo[(i, j)] = dp[i][j].
