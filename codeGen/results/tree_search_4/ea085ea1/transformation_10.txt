===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: Compare all possible substrings of str1 and str2, considering their lengths from 1 to N. Optimal substructure: Find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings by recursively combining smaller substrings.

The state could be defined as dp[i][k] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position i in str1 and length k.
dp[i][k] = 0 if s1[i-k+1..i] doesn't exist in s2 or vice versa; else, 
    dp[i][k] = max(dp[j][l]) + 1 where j < i and l <= k
Use a dictionary to memoize the dp[i][k] values for repeated calculations.

Let's sort the substrings of str1 and str2 by their lengths. Then, iterate over the sorted substrings from shortest to longest. For each substring, 
    find all occurrences in both strings, and update the dp[i][k] accordingly.
Finally, return the maximum value in the dp table.
