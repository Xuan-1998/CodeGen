===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: Compare all possible substrings of str1 and str2, considering their lengths from 1 to N. Optimal substructure: Find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings by recursively combining smaller substrings.
The state could be defined as dp[i][j] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j].
dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. If str1[:i] is a prefix of str2[:j], then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]; else, dp[i][j] is the minimum of the following: 
dp[i][j-1] for i < j (extend current common substring), or 
min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) for i > 0 and j > 0 (find new common substring from left or right) or 
0 if no common substring (no overlapping subproblem)
Create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j].
Fill dp table in top-down manner. 
Finally, return dp[N-1][N-1] as the answer.
