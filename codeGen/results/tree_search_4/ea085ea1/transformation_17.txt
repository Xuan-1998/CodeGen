===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: Compare all possible substrings of str1 and str2, considering their lengths from 1 to N. Optimal substructure: Find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings by recursively combining smaller substrings.

The state could be defined as dp[j][k] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position j in str2 and length k.
dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j].

Use a 3D array dp[N+1][N+1][N+1] where dp[i][j][k] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings of length k between str1[:i] and str2[:j].
Initialize all values in dp to 0.
Iterate over each possible substring of str1 and str2, considering lengths from 1 to N. For each pair of substrings, check if they are equal.
If the substrings are equal, update dp[i][j][k] = max(dp[i-1][j-1][k-1], dp[i-1][j][k]) + 1 for all k <= length of substring.
Return dp[N][N][N]
