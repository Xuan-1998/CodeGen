===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: Compare all possible substrings of str1 and str2, considering their lengths from 1 to N. Optimal substructure: Find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings by recursively combining smaller substrings.

Create a 2D array dp with dimensions (N+1) x (N+1), where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position i in str1 and j in str2, considering lengths from 0 to N.

Initialize all values in dp as -1. For the base case, set dp[0][j] = dp[j][0] = 0 for all j, since there are no common non-overlapping substrings when either string is empty.

For each position i and j, if str1[i-1] == str2[j-1], then consider the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position i-1 in str1 and j-1 in str2 (dp[i-1][j-1]), and add 1 to it.

Otherwise, consider the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for all possible lengths k from 0 to N (max(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(N+1))), and return the maximum value.

Return dp[N][N] as the result, which represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1 and str2.
