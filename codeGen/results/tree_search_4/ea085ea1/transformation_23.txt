===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: Compare all possible substrings of str1 and str2, considering their lengths from 1 to N. Optimal substructure: Find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings by recursively combining smaller substrings.

The state could be defined as dp[i][j] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position i in str1 and j in str2.
dp[i][0] = 0 for all i, since there's no way to get a substring of length 0
dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since the first character can't be part of any substring

For dp[i][j], if str1[i-1] is equal to str2[j-1], then we have two options: either consider this character as part of a new common substring or not. If we do, then the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position i in str1 and j in str2 would be dp[i-1][k] + 1 for some k in range(j). If we don't, then it's the same as considering the character not part of any substring, which is dp[i-1][j].

dp[N-1][N-1] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position N-1 in str1 and N-1 in str2
Return dp[N-1][N-1]

Create a 2D table to store the dynamic programming state with size (N+1) x (N+1)
