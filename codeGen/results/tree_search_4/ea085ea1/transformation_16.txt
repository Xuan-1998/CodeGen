===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: Compare all possible substrings of str1 and str2, considering their lengths from 1 to N.
Optimal substructure: Find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings by recursively combining smaller substrings.

The state could be defined as dp[i][k] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position i in str1 and length k.

dp[i][k] = 
    if exists a substring in str2 with the same content as str1[i-k:i+1]:
        dp[i-1][k-1] + 1;
    else:
        dp[i-1][k];

for i in range(N+1):
    dp[i][0] = 0; // base case: no substrings of length 0
for k in range(1, N+1):
    for i in range(k, N+1):
        if str1[i-k:i+1] in str2:
            dp[i][k] = dp[i-1][k-1] + 1;
        else:
            dp[i][k] = dp[i-1][k];

max_common_substrings = max(dp[N][i] for i in range(N+1));
