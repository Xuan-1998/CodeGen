===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: Compare all possible substrings of str1 and str2, considering their lengths from 1 to N. Optimal substructure: Find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings by recursively combining smaller substrings.

The state could be defined as dp[i][j] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position i in str1 and j in str2.
dp[i][j] = 0 if i == j, otherwise 
    sum(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(j)) + 1 
    if str1[i-1] is equal to str2[j-1], 
    and dp[i-1][j-1] is the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position i-1 in str1 and j-1 in str2.

Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at position i in str1 and j in str2.
Fill in dp[0][j] for all j with 0, since there are no substrings of length 0.
For each i from 1 to N:
    For each j from i to N:
        If str1[i-1] is equal to str2[j-1], 
            then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
        else dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(j))
Return dp[N][N]
