===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is characterized by finding the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between two strings. This problem can be solved using memoization in a top-down approach, as it has overlapping subproblems.

The transition relationship can be formulated as: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 if str1[i-1] == str2[j-1] else 0, dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

You can use a list of lists to store the dynamic programming state. Initialize dp with zeros.

For each pair of characters at positions i and j:

    * If they are equal, update dp[i][j] as max(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1, dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
    * Otherwise, set it to max(0, dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

To get the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1 and str2, return the maximum value in the last row or column of dp.
