===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify state variables: Let dp[i][j] be the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i and j in str1 and str2 respectively. The base case is when i or j is 0.

dp[i][j] = 1 if str1[0..i-1] == str2[0..j-1]
max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) if str1[i] != str2[j]

Implement both tabulation and memoization by creating a 2D table for storing the dynamic programming state and updating it accordingly.

for i from 1 to N:
    for j from 1 to N:
        if str1[0..i-1] == str2[0..j-1]:
            dp[i][j] = 1
        else:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

Return dp[N][N]
