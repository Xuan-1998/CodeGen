===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is characterized by finding the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between two strings. This problem can be solved using memoization in a top-down approach, as it has overlapping subproblems.

To solve this problem, we'll use dynamic programming with memoization to keep track of the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at each position i and j in str1 and str2, respectively.

The transition relationship can be formulated as:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 if str1[i-1] == str2[j-1] else 0, dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

Implement dynamic programming by defining a function for each position in the string and calculate the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between two strings.

To improve this plan, we can add checks to handle edge cases such as:

* If i or j is 0, return 0
* If str1[i-1] != str2[j-1], reset dp[i][j]

This will ensure the algorithm works correctly for all possible inputs.

The updated version of the plan is shown above. It includes checks to handle edge cases and uses dynamic programming with memoization to find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between two strings.
