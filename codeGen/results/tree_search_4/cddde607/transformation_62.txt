===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 3D table dp[][][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

dp[i][j][k] = (arr[i][j] <= k) ? 
    (dp[i+1][j][k-arr[i][j]] + dp[i][j+1][k-arr[i][j]]) : 0

Choose the correct formulation of state and transition relationships as:
If the current cell has coins, then we can either move down or right. If not, then there's no way to collect more coins.

Tabulate the dynamic programming table in a bottom-up manner, filling up the table using base cases and recursive relationships:

1. Base case: dp[0][0][k] = (arr[0][0] <= k) ? 1 : 0
2. Recursive relation:
   - If the current cell has coins, then we can either move down or right.
   - If not, then there's no way to collect more coins.

Edge cases: 
- For K == 0, return 1 (only one path possible)
- For N <= K, return 0 (no paths possible)
