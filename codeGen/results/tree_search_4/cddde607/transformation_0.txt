===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 3D table dp[][][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

dp[i][j][k] = total number of paths collecting exactly k coins ending at cell (i, j),

Consider the state as dp[i][j][k]: number of ways to reach cell (i, j) with k coins collected so far. 

Dynamic Programming with Tabulation: Fill up a 3D table dp[][][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

Let's iterate over each cell (i, j) from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.
For each cell, we consider all possible ways of reaching that cell with exactly k coins collected so far. 
We do this by looking at the cells above it (if i > 0), the cells to its left (if j > 0), and then add the number of paths collecting exactly k-coins ending at those cells.
If we reach a cell where i == N - 1 or j == N - 1, it means we have reached the bottom right corner. 
We update dp[i][j][k] with the total number of ways to collect exactly k coins.

Finally, return dp[0][0][K], which represents the total number of paths collecting exactly K coins starting from the top left corner.
