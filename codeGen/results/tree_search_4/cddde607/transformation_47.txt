===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 3D table dp[][][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

dp[i][j][k] = num_paths_to_collect_k_coins_at_cell_i_j_with_k_left, where i is the row index, j is the column index, and k is the number of coins left to collect.

dp[i][j][k] = 
    dp[i-1][j][min(k, arr[i][j])] + 
    dp[i][j-1][max(0, k-arr[i][j])]
if i > 0 and j > 0 else 0

Use dictionary memoization to store intermediate results. Initialize the base case for the top left corner (i.e., dp[0][0][k]) and propagate the values to other cells.

Base case: dp[0][0][k] = 1 if k == arr[0][0], else 0

The plan correctly identifies dynamic programming with memoization as a viable approach, considering subproblems and storing intermediate results. It also correctly identifies the recursive relation between dp[i][j][k] and its subproblems.

To improve the plan, consider using more descriptive variable names and providing additional comments to explain the logic behind the code. The edge cases are not explicitly mentioned in the plan but can be handled by initializing the base case for the top left corner as described above.
