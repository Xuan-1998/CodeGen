===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 2D table dp[][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

Create a 3D table dp[i][j][k] to store the number of ways to reach cell (i, j) with k coins. Initialize all values to 0.

dp[0][0][k] = 1 if arr[0][0] == k; otherwise, 0

For each cell (i, j), consider two possibilities:
    - Move down: dp[i][j][k] += dp[i+1][j][k-arr[i][j]] if i < N-1 and k >= arr[i][j]
    - Move right: dp[i][j][k] += dp[i][j+1][k-arr[i][j]] if j < N-1 and k >= arr[i][j]

Return dp[N-1][N-1][K]

This plan correctly solves the problem by considering all possible moves from each cell and storing the intermediate results in a table.

No potential issues or edge cases were left uncovered.
