===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 2D table dp[][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1] if arr[i][j] <= K, else 0,
State: dp[i][j] represents the number of paths that collect exactly K coins from the top left corner to (i, j). The state is determined by the position (i, j) and the total number of coins collected so far.
To fill a 2D table dp[][] with size N x N, where each cell dp[i][j] represents the number of paths that collect exactly K coins from the top left corner to (i, j).
If arr[i][j] == K, then consider two cases:
    1. If i == N-1 and j == N-1, then there is only one path.
    2. Else, consider all possible paths and add them up.
