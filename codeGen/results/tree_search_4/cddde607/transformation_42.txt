===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming can be used with tabulation approach where a 2D table dp[][] is filled from top-down manner with memoization to avoid overlapping sub-problems.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = maximum number of coins that can be collected when reaching cell (i, j).

Think about the state as the current position (i, j) and the total number of coins collected so far. The transition relationship can be formulated as:

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) if arr[i][j] <= k else 0

This represents the number of ways to reach cell (i, j) with exactly k coins.

Develop a recursive function with memoization to avoid redundant calculations and store the results in a dictionary or cache. The base cases could be when i == N - 1 and j == N - 1, which means we have reached the bottom right corner, so return 1 if arr[i][j] <= k else 0.

The recursive function should be called with memoization to avoid redundant calculations. If dp[i][j] is already calculated, just return its value; otherwise, calculate it and store the result in the dictionary or cache.
