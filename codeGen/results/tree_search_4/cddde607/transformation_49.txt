===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 3D table dp[][][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

dp[i][j][k] = num_paths_to_collect_k_coins_at_cell_i_j_with_k_left,
where i is the row index, j is the column index, and k is the number of coins left to collect.

Initially, set dp[0][0][K-arr[0][0]] = 1 (base case for top-left corner)

For each cell arr[i][j]:
  For each path that collects K coins:
    If there's a way to collect K-coins without going through this cell,
      then the number of paths at this cell is the sum of the number
      of paths from cells above and left, minus the number of paths
      that go through this cell.
    Else, set dp[i][j][K-arr[i][j]] = 1 (new path starts here)

Finally, return dp[N-1][N-1][0] as the total number of possible paths
