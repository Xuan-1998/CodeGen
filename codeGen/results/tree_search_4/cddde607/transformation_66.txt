===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 3D table dp[][][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

dp[i][j][k] = (arr[i][j] <= k) ? 
    ((i == N-1 && j == N-1) || 
     (dp[i+1][j][k-arr[i][j]] + dp[i][j+1][k-arr[i][j]]) > 0) 
    : 0

State transition is:
for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N):
        if arr[i][j] <= k:
            dp[i][j][k] = (i == N-1 && j == N-1) || 
                (dp[i+1][j][k-arr[i][j]] + dp[i][j+1][k-arr[i][j]]) > 0
        else:
            dp[i][j][k] = 0

Using a 3D table dp[][][] with the same size as the input matrix, where each cell contains the number of paths that collect exactly k coins ending at that cell.
