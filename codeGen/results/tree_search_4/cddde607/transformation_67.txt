===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 3D table dp[][][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

dp[i][j][k] = (arr[i][j] <= k) ? 
    (
        sum(dp[i+1][j][k-arr[i][j]] for i in range(N)) + 
        sum(dp[i][j+1][k-arr[i][j]] for j in range(N))
    ) : 0

dp[][][] will be initialized with all values being 0.
The state transition is correct. The recurrence relation correctly captures the idea that you can move either down or right from a cell.

To improve this plan, consider sorting the cells based on their coin counts before filling up the dp[][][]. This way, you'll avoid unnecessary computations as you fill up the table.

As for edge cases, make sure to handle them correctly. For example, if K is 0, there are no possible paths that collect exactly K coins, so return 0 in this case.
