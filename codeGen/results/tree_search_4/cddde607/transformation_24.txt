===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming can be used with tabulation approach where a 2D table dp[][] is filled from top-down manner with memoization to avoid overlapping sub-problems.

The state expression could be:
dp[i][j] = number of ways to reach cell (i, j) collecting exactly K coins.
dp[i][j] = the number of ways to reach cell (i, j) such that the path taken collects k-coins so far

Here's how it can be improved:

- Initialize dp[][] with zeros.
- Fill dp[][] in a bottom-up manner. For each cell (i, j), consider all possible moves from cells above and to the left.
- If the current cell has coins, update dp[i][j] by adding the number of ways to reach the previous cell collecting k-coins minus the number of ways to reach the previous cell with zero coins.
- If the current cell does not have coins, simply copy the value from the top or left cell.
- Finally, return dp[N-1][N-1], which represents the total number of paths that collect exactly K coins.

Potential issues with the plan:
- Edge cases: Make sure to handle edge cases like K = 0, N = 1, etc.
- Base case: Ensure that there is a base case for when i or j reaches the end of the matrix.
- Memoization: Use memoization to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.
