===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 3D table dp[][][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

dp[i][j][k] = 
    if i == N-1 && j == N-1: 
        return k == 0 ? 1 : 0 
    else:
        sum of 
            dp[i+1][j][k-arr[i][j]] 
            and 
            dp[i][j+1][k-arr[i][j]]

Using a 3D table with nested loops to store intermediate results and fill up the table in bottom-up manner.
