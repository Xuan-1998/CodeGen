===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 3D table dp[][][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

dp[i][j][k] = 
    sum(
        dp[i+1][j][k-arr[i][j]] if k >= arr[i][j]
        + dp[i][j+1][k-arr[i][j]] if k >= arr[i][j],
    ) for i, j, k: 0 <= i < N, 0 <= j < N, and 0 <= k < K
base case:
when i == N-1 or j == N-1, then return 
    1 if k == 0 else 
    0

dp[i][j][k] = sum of 
    dp[i+1][j][k-arr[i][j]] + 
    dp[i][j+1][k-arr[i][j]]
Using a recursive function with memoization to store intermediate results and optimize computation.
