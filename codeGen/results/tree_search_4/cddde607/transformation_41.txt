===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming can also be used with tabulation approach where a 2D table dp[][] is filled from top-down manner with memoization to avoid overlapping sub-problems.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = maximum number of coins that can be collected when reaching cell (i, j).

Think about the state as the current position (i, j) and the total number of coins collected so far. The transition relationship can be formulated as:

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1] if arr[i][j] <= k else 0

This represents the number of ways to reach cell (i, j) with exactly k coins.

Consider using memoization to store the intermediate results for overlapping sub-problems, so that they are not recomputed again when needed.

To handle edge cases:
- If N or K is less than 1, return 0 as there's no valid path.
- Initialize dp[][] with zeros.
- Fill dp[][] from top-down manner according to the transition relationship.
- Return dp[N-1][N-1] as it represents the number of ways to reach the bottom-right corner.
