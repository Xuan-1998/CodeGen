===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming can also be used with tabulation approach where a 2D table dp[][] is filled from top-down manner with memoization to avoid overlapping sub-problems.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = number of ways to reach cell (i, j) collecting exactly K coins.
dp[i][j] = the number of ways to reach cell (i, j) such that the path taken collects k-coins so far

Implement a top-down approach by using memoization and filling up the dp[][] table from top-left to bottom-right.

Initially fill up the first row and first column with base cases:
dp[0][j] = 1 if arr[0][j] <= K else 0 (for j in range(N))
dp[i][0] = 1 if arr[i][0] <= K else 0 (for i in range(N))

For the rest of the cells, calculate dp[i][j] based on the values of top-left, top-right, and left-top cells.

if arr[i][j] <= K then
    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
else
    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

Finally, return dp[N-1][N-1]
