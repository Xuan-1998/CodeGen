===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 3D table dp[][][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

dp[i][j][k] = 
    if (i == N-1 and j == N-1) then
        if k == 0 then return 1 else return 0
    elif i == N-1 or j == N-1 then
        if k == 0 then return 1 else return 0
    else 
        if k < arr[i][j] then
            return dp[i+1][j][k] + dp[i][j+1][k]
        elif k >= arr[i][j] then
            return dp[i+1][j][k-arr[i][j]] + dp[i][j+1][k-arr[i][j]]

Use a 3D table dp[][][] to store the intermediate results of subproblems, where dp[i][j][k] represents the number of paths from the top left corner to cell (i, j) that collect exactly k coins.
