===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results in a 2D table dp[][].

dp[i][j] = number of paths that collect exactly k coins from cell (i, j) to the bottom right corner if i < N-1 or j < N-1 and arr[i][j] <= k
dp[i][j] = 0 otherwise

The base case is when we are at the bottom right corner (i.e., i == N-1), in which case dp[i][j] = 1 if the number of coins in cell (i, j) is equal to K, and 0 otherwise.

To fill up the table dp[][] in a bottom-up manner, consider subproblems and store intermediate results. For each cell (i, j), calculate the number of paths that collect exactly k coins from cell (i-1, j) or (i, j-1) to the bottom right corner if arr[i][j] <= k.

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1] if i < N-1 and j < N-1 and arr[i][j] <= k

The function should return dp[0][0], which represents the number of paths that collect exactly K coins from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.
