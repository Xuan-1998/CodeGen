===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 3D table dp[][][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

dp[i][j][k] = num_paths_to_collect_k_coins_at_cell_i_j_with_k_left, 
where i is the row index, j is the column index, and k is the number of coins left to collect.

1. Initialize dp[0][0][0] to 1 (base case: there's only one way to reach the top-left cell), set all other cells in dp[][][] to -1 (unknown).

2. For each cell (i, j) and remaining coins k:
    a. If i < N-1 or j < N-1, consider two possible paths from this cell: 
       i. Down: dp[i+1][j][k-arr[i][j]]
       ii. Right: dp[i][j+1][k-arr[i][j]]

    b. Calculate the total number of paths by summing up these two possibilities: 
       dp[i][j][k] = dp[i+1][j][k-arr[i][j]] + dp[i][j+1][k-arr[i][j]]

3. The final answer is stored in dp[N-1][N-1][K], which represents the number of paths that collect exactly K coins.
