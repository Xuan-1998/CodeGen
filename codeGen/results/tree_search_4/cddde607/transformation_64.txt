===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 3D table dp[][][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

dp[i][j][k] = (i==N-1 && j == N-1) ? 1 : 
    ((arr[i][j] <= k) ? 
        (dp[i+1][j][k-arr[i][j]] + dp[i][j+1][k-arr[i][j]]) : 
        0
    )
