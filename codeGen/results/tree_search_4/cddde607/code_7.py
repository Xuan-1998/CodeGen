===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 2D table dp[][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.
dp[i][j] = total number of paths collecting exactly k coins ending at cell (i, j),
To avoid redundant calculations and optimize the solution, consider these base cases:
- When i == N - 1 and j == N - 1, dp[N - 1][N - 1] is the total number of paths that collect exactly K coins.
dp[i][j] is the sum of two possibilities: either collect one more coin from cell (i, j) and move down or right, or skip this cell and move to the next one. To decide which option to choose, compare arr[i][j] with k:
- If arr[i][j] < k, then you have to visit this cell to collect the required number of coins, so dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j] + dp[i][j + 1].
- If arr[i][j] >= k, then you can either skip this cell or add its coin count to your total. In the latter case, you have to visit this cell and move diagonally down-right. So, dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j + 1].
Implement memoization using a dictionary where keys are tuples representing cell coordinates and values are the total number of paths collecting exactly k coins ending at that cell.
