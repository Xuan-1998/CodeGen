===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming can be used with a tabulation approach where a 2D table dp[][] is filled from top-down manner with memoization to avoid overlapping sub-problems.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = number of ways to reach cell (i, j) collecting exactly K coins.
dp[i][j] = 
    if arr[i][j] is included in the path and k >= arr[i][j]:
        dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
    else:
        0

Memoization by storing intermediate results in a dictionary and checking if the result is already computed before computing it.
Fill up the table row by row from top to bottom.
For each cell, check if the current coin is included in the path or not.
If included, calculate the number of ways to include this coin by adding dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1].
If not included, set it to 0.

Return dp[N-1][N-1], which represents the number of possible paths that collect exactly K coins.
