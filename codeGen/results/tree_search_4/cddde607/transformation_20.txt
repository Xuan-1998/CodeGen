===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 2D table dp[][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j+1] if i < N-1 or j < N-1 and arr[i][j] <= k
dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j-1] if i > 0 and j > 0

We need to add a base case for the top-left corner, where we start collecting coins. We can do this by initializing dp[0][0] as 1 (since there's only one way to reach the top-left cell) or 0 (depending on whether we consider collecting exactly K coins in this cell).

dp[i][j] = 1 if i == 0 and j == 0 and arr[i][j] <= k
dp[0][0] = 1

Fill up the table in bottom-up manner, starting from the top-left corner.
