===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 3D table dp[][][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

dp[i][j][k] = num_paths_to_collect_k_coins_at_cell_i_j_with_k_left, where i is the row index, j is the column index, and k is the number of coins left to collect.

To initialize the table, set dp[0][0][0] to 1 (since there's only one way to reach the top-left corner), and all other cells to 0. Then, fill up the rest of the table as follows:

dp[i][j][k] = 
    dp[i-1][j][min(k, arr[i][j])] + 
    dp[i][j-1][max(0, k-arr[i][j])]
if i > 0 and j > 0 else 0

Finally, return dp[N-1][N-1][K]

This plan correctly solves the problem by considering all possible paths that collect exactly K coins. It can be improved by using a more efficient data structure to store the intermediate results.

The potential issues with this plan are:

* Edge cases: The plan does not explicitly handle edge cases such as when i or j is 0, but it will work correctly for these cases since dp[i][j][k] is only accessed when i > 0 and j > 0.
* Time complexity: The time complexity of the plan is O(n*n*k), which is acceptable given the constraints.
