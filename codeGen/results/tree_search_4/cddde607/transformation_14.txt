===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 2D table dp[][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j+1] if arr[i][j] == k - 1 and i > 0, j < N-1
else 0,

State: dp[i][j] represents the number of paths that collect exactly K coins from the top left corner to (i, j). The state is determined by the position (i, j) and the total number of coins collected so far.

To create a 2D table dp[][] with size N x K+1, where each cell dp[i][j] represents the number of paths that collect exactly j coins from the top left corner to (i, N-1).
