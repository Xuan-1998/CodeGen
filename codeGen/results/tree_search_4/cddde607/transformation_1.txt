===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] = total number of paths collecting exactly k coins ending at cell (i, j),
Consider the state as dp[i][j][k]: number of ways to reach cell (i, j) with k coins collected so far,
Memoization using Dictionary: Use dictionary to store the solutions of subproblems and look them up when needed.
For each cell (i, j), calculate the total number of paths that collect exactly k coins by considering all possible paths from top-left to this cell:
    1. If i == N - 1 and j == N - 1, then there is only one path ending at the bottom-right corner which collects k coins.
    2. Else if i < N - 1 or j < N - 1, consider two possibilities: either come from top cell (i+1, j) or from left cell (i, j+1).
        a. If coming from top cell, then subtract the number of coins in that cell and add the current count.
        b. If coming from left cell, then subtract the number of coins in that cell and add the current count.
    3. Store the intermediate result in dp[i][j] for memoization.
