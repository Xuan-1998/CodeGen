===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization and tabulation in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

dp[i][j][k] = sum_of(dp[i+1][j][k-arr[i][j]] + dp[i][j+1][k-arr[i][j]]) 
for base case: when i == N-1 or j == N-1, then return 1 if k == 0 else return 0.

dp[i][j][k] = if i == N-1 or j == N-1 then return 1 if k == 0 else return the minimum of dp[i+1][j][k-arr[i][j]] and dp[i][j+1][k-arr[i][j]]

Tabulation using Iterative Approach: Implement tabulation by filling up a 3D table row-wise or column-wise, considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.
For each cell in the table, calculate dp[i][j][k] as follows:
- Base case: If i == N-1 or j == N-1, then return 1 if k == 0 else return 0.
- Otherwise, calculate dp[i][j][k] as the sum of dp[i+1][j][k-arr[i][j]] and dp[i][j+1][k-arr[i][j]]

The final answer is stored in dp[0][0][K], which represents the number of paths that collect exactly K coins.
