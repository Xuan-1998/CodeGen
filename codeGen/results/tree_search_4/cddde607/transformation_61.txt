===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 3D table dp[][][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

dp[i][j][k] = (arr[i][j] <= k) ? 
  (dp[i+1][j][k-arr[i][j]] + dp[i][j+1][k-arr[i][j]]) : 0

Choose the correct formulation of state and transition relationships as:
Let's use a recursive approach with memoization to avoid redundant computations.

Create a 3D table, dp[][][], where dp[i][j][k] represents the number of paths from cell (i, j) that collect exactly k coins.
Use base cases: if i == N-1 and j == N-1, return 1 if arr[i][j] <= k; otherwise, return 0.

Transition relationships:
If arr[i][j] <= k, then the number of paths from cell (i, j) that collect exactly k coins is the sum of the number of paths from cells (i+1, j) and (i, j+1) that collect exactly k-arr[i][j] coins.
Otherwise, there are no such paths.

Use memoization to store intermediate results: dp[i][j][k] = (arr[i][j] <= k) ? 
  (dp[i+1][j][k-arr[i][j]] + dp[i][j+1][k-arr[i][j]]) : 0

Return the value of dp[0][0][K].
