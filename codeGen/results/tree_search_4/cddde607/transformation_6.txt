===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization.

Let's define dp[][] as follows:

dp[i][j] = total number of paths collecting exactly k coins ending at cell (i, j),

where 0 <= i < N and 0 <= j < N. The base case is dp[0][0] = 1.

Fill up the table from top to bottom and left to right as follows:

- If arr[i][j] + dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j+1] == k, then set dp[i][j] = 1.
- Otherwise, set dp[i][j] = 0.

Finally, return dp[N-1][N-1].
