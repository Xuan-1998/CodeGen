===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 3D table dp[][][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

dp[i][j][k] = sum_of(dp[i+1][j][k-arr[i][j]] and dp[i][j+1][k-arr[i][j]]) for base case: when i == N-1 or j == N-1, then return 1 if k == 0 else return 0.

dp[i][j][k] = if k > 0 then 
    max_of(dp[i+1][j][k-arr[i][j]] and dp[i][j+1][k-arr[i][j]])
else
    1

Implement memoization by using a dictionary to store the intermediate results and retrieve them when needed, avoiding redundant computation.

dp[][][] = [[[[0 for k in range(k_max)] for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]] where k_max is K and n is N

Fill up dp[][][] table in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results. 

For each cell dp[i][j][k], calculate the value as described above.

Return dp[0][0][K]
