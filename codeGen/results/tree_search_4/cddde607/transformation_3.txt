===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization. The idea is to fill up a 2D table dp[][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

Let's define dp[i][j] as the total number of paths collecting exactly k coins ending at cell (i, j).

To initialize the dp table, set dp[0][0] = 1 because there is one path that collects exactly k coins starting from the top left corner. For all other cells, set dp[i][j] = 0 initially.

Now, fill up the dp table row by row:

For each cell (i, j):
    If i == N - 1 and j == N - 1, it means we have reached the bottom right corner.
        dp[i][j] = 1 if arr[i][j] == k else 0. This is because there is exactly one path that collects k coins ending at cell (i, j) when we are already at the last row and column.

    Else:
        If i < N - 1 or j < N - 1, it means we can still move down or right.
            dp[i][j] = sum of all possible paths to reach this cell. This is because for each path that collects k coins ending at (i, j), there are two possibilities: either the last coin was collected from cell (i, j) itself, or it was collected from a previous cell in the same row or column.
                dp[i][j] = sum of all paths collecting k - arr[i][j] coins and ending at cells (i + 1, j) and (i, j + 1).
