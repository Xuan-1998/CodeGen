===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where you fill up a 3D table dp[][][] in bottom-up manner by considering subproblems and storing intermediate results.

Create an additional 2D array dp[][] to store the number of paths for each cell (i, j).

State transition: 
dp[i][j] = (arr[i][j] <= k) ? 
    (dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j+1]) : 
    (k == arr[i][j]) ? 1 : 0

For the base case:
dp[0][0] = (arr[0][0] <= K) ? 1 : 0

State transition for other cells:
dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]
dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1]

Final answer: 
return dp[N-1][N-1]
