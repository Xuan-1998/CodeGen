===BEGIN PLAN===
Create a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1) and initialize it with zeros. The dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of integer-sided squares that tile the rectangle of size i x j.

Iterate through the dp array from top-left to bottom-right, updating the values based on the previously computed ones.

For each cell dp[i][j], calculate the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j. This can be done by considering all possible squares that can fit in the rectangle:

* If j is less than or equal to sqrt(i), consider a square of side length min(j, sqrt(i)) and recursively call dp[i-min(side_length)^2][j-side_length] (if i >= side_length^2) or dp[i][j] (otherwise).
* Otherwise, don't need any squares.

The base case is when i or j is 0, in which case we don't need any squares. Set dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] to 0 for all i, j.

Fill in the rest of the dp array using the above logic.
Return dp[n][m] as the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile the given rectangle.
