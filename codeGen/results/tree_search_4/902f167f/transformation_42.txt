===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Create two 2D arrays: one for storing the minimum number of squares (dp) and another for storing the sizes of the squares used to tile each rectangle (size_dp).
Let the state be dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j, with 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= m.
Let the state be size_dp[i][j] storing the sizes of the squares used to tile each rectangle.

For each cell in the table, consider all possible square sizes that can fit within the rectangle (i.e., 1 <= s <= min(i, j)). For each such size s, calculate the number of remaining cells after placing a square of size s. Update dp[i][j] and size_dp[i][j] accordingly.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
size_dp[i][j] = min(size_dp[i-1][j], size_dp[i][j-1])

Since the problem only requires integer-sided squares, ensure that all square sizes used to tile each rectangle are indeed integers.

Finally, return the value of dp[n][m].
