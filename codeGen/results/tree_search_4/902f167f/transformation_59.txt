===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Create a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1) to store the minimum number of squares for each possible rectangle size, and fill it in iteratively.

The state is dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j. The base case is when i = 0 or j = 0, in which case we only need zero squares (since an empty rectangle can be tiled with zero squares).

For each cell dp[i][j], consider all possible square sizes k such that 1 <= k <= min(i, j). The transition relationship is:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[k-1][j-1] + i*k for k)

This equation calculates the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j by considering all possible square sizes and their corresponding tiling configurations.

Consider using dynamic programming with two nested loops to fill in the dp array, where the inner loop iterates over all possible square sizes and the outer loop iterates over all possible rectangle sizes.

Finally, return dp[n][m] as the minimum number of squares required to tile the original rectangle of size n x m.
