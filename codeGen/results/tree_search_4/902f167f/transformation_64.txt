===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation and memoization. Create a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1) to store the minimum number of squares for each possible rectangle size, and fill it in iteratively.

The state could be dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j. The base case is when i = 0 or j = 0, in which case we need no squares. For all other cells, consider all possible square sizes k such that 1 <= k <= min(i, j), and transition relationships:
dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-k][j] + dp[k-1][k-1] for k)
Apply memoization by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when possible.

Edge cases: 
- For i = 0 or j = 0, return 0.
- For i > n or j > m, return -1 (or handle it as desired).
