===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, you can use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming and memoization. Define a function that takes the dimensions of the rectangle as input, and fill up a 2D array dp in a bottom-up manner.

State: dp[i][j] is the minimum value among all possible ways to place a square in the remaining area.
dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares required to cover the top-left i x j rectangle, for 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m.

Fill up the dp array as follows:

- For the base case (i == 0 or j == 0), set dp[i][j] to 1 because a single square is enough to cover the area.
- For other cases:
    - If i >= k and j >= k, where k is the side length of the largest possible square that can fit in the remaining area (i.e., min(i, j)), calculate dp[i][j] as the minimum value among:
        + Place a square of size k x k at the top-left corner (dp[i-k][j-k]+1) and recursively fill up the remaining area.
        + Do not place a square at the top-left corner (dp[i][j]) and recursively fill up the remaining area.
    - Otherwise, set dp[i][j] to 1 because a single square is enough to cover the area.

The final answer will be stored in dp[n-1][m-1].
