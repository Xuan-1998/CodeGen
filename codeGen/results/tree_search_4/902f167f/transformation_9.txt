===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach, where you calculate the minimum number of squares for sub-rectangles and store them in a 2D array to avoid redundant calculations.

The base case could be dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] being 0 for all i, j because an empty rectangle or a rectangle with one side can't be tiled by any squares.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares required to tile the sub-rectangle from (0, 0) to (i, j).

Use a nested loop to iterate over the sub-rectangles and calculate the minimum number of squares required to tile each one.

For each cell dp[i][j], consider all possible square sizes that can fit in the sub-rectangle. The size of the square must be less than or equal to min(i, j). For each possible square size, if the remainder of i divided by the square size is 0 and the remainder of j divided by the square size is 0, then you found a suitable square that can cover the current sub-rectangle. In this case, the minimum number of squares required for the current sub-rectangle is dp[i - square_size][j - square_size] + 1.

If no such square exists, the minimum number of squares required for the current sub-rectangle is simply the sum of the minimum number of squares required to tile the top and left rectangles (dp[i][j - 1] and dp[i - 1][j]) plus 1.

Finally, return dp[n][m] as the result.
