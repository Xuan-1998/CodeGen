===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Create a 2D array to store the minimum number of squares for each possible rectangle size, and fill it in iteratively.

The state could be dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j, with 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= m. The base case is when i = 1 or j = 1, in which case we only need one square.

Create a 2D array dp of size n x m, where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j.

For each cell dp[i][j], consider all possible square sizes k such that 1 <= k <= min(i, j). Then, transition relationships:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[k-1][j-1] + (i-k+1)*(j-k+1) / k^2 for k)

To avoid overcounting, we can optimize the transition by only considering squares that completely fit in the current cell.

Edge cases to consider: dp[0][j] and dp[i][0], which represent rectangles of width 0 or height 0. In these cases, the minimum number of squares is 0, since the rectangle is empty.
