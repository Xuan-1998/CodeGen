===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Create a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1) to store the minimum number of squares for each possible rectangle size, and fill it in iteratively.

The base case is when i or j is 0, in which case we don't need any squares: dp[0][j] = 0, dp[i][0] = 0. This is because a rectangle with zero rows or columns doesn't require any squares to tile it.

For the general case (1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= m), consider the following possibilities:

* If the current cell's size is less than or equal to the smallest square side, we can use that many squares of that size.
* If the current cell's size is greater than the smallest square side, we need to tile the remaining area with smaller squares.

Fill in the dp array iteratively using these possibilities:
1. For each i and j, calculate the minimum number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size (i-1) x (j-1).
2. If the current cell's size is less than or equal to the smallest square side, add 1 to the result from step 1.
3. Otherwise, add the result from step 1 to the minimum number of squares required to tile the remaining area.

The final answer is stored in dp[n][m].
