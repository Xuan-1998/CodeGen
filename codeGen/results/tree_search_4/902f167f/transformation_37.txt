===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Create a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1) to store the minimum number of squares for each possible rectangle size, and fill it in iteratively.

Let the state be dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j, with 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= m. Initialize the base cases: dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since an empty rectangle requires no squares; dp[i][0] = 0 for all i, since a vertical rectangle (of height i) can be tiled with zero squares.

The recurrence relation is: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + dp[k][j-1]) for k in range(1, min(i, j)+1). This means that the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j is the minimum of the following two cases:

* Place a square of side length k at the top-right corner of the rectangle (i.e., dp[i-1][k] for some 1 <= k <= min(i, j)), and recursively tile the remaining rectangle of size (i-k) x (j-k).
* Place a square of side length k at the bottom-left corner of the rectangle (i.e., dp[k][j-1] for some 1 <= k <= min(i, j)), and recursively tile the remaining rectangle of size (i-k) x (j-k).

Create a 2D array to store the minimum number of squares for each possible rectangle size, and fill it in iteratively using nested loops. Return dp[n][m] as the final answer.
