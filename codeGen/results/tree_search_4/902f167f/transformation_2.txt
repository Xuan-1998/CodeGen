===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach, where you calculate the minimum number of squares for sub-rectangles and store them in a 2D array to avoid redundant calculations.

The state expression could be defined as dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j.
dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares required to tile a sub-rectangle of size i x j, and the transition relationship could be:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-k][j-l] + 1) for all k <= i and l <= j

Design a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations by storing the results of sub-problems.

In addition, initialize the dp array with base cases, where dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] represent the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size 0 x j or i x 0 respectively. These base cases can be set to 0 as no squares are needed for an empty rectangle.

Also, consider handling edge cases such as when n or m is less than or equal to 1.
