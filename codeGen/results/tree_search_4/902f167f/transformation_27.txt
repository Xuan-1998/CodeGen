===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, you can use a dynamic programming approach with memoization. Define a function that takes the dimensions of the rectangle as input, and use memoization to store the results of subproblems so they can be reused.

State: dp[i][j] is 1 if the rectangle can be tiled with a single square, and 0 otherwise.
Define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of squares needed to tile a rectangle of size i x j, where dp[i][0] = 1 and dp[0][j] = 1.

Memoize the function using a dictionary. For each subproblem, check if it has been solved before (i.e., if its result is already in the memoized dictionary). If so, return the stored result; otherwise, solve the problem recursively and store the result in the dictionary for future use.

To improve the plan, you can consider optimizing the memoization step by storing only the minimum number of squares needed to tile a rectangle, rather than storing whether the rectangle can be tiled with a single square.

The potential issues with this plan are that it does not explicitly handle edge cases (e.g., what if n or m is 0?) and that it does not provide any guarantees about the efficiency of the solution. 

To make the plan more robust, you could add explicit checks for these edge cases and optimize the memoization step as described above.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
