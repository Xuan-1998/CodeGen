===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, you can use a top-down approach with memoization. Define a function that takes the dimensions of the rectangle as input, and use memoization to store the results of subproblems so they can be reused.

State: dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j.

dp[i][j] is the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j, considering all possible placements of a square of side length k (where 1 <= k <= min(i, j)), and choosing the one that minimizes dp[i-k][j-kl].

Use memoization by implementing a recursive function with a cache to store the results of subproblems.

Edge cases: For rectangles with dimensions 0 x n or m x 0, return 0 because no squares are needed.
For rectangles with dimensions 1 x 1, return 1 because one square is needed.
