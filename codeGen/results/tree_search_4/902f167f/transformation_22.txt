===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, you can use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming and memoization. Define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j.

State: The state is represented by the dimensions of the rectangle (i, j).

Transition function: For each cell dp[i][j], consider all possible square sizes k such that 1 <= k <= min(i, j). For each k, calculate the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i-k x j and add 1 (since we need an extra square to cover the top-left corner).

Base case: dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 0 for all i and j, since a rectangle with zero width or height cannot be tiled.

Initialization: Initialize the entire dp array with zeros before starting the iteration.

Iterative process:
    For each k from 1 to min(n, m), do the following:
        For each i from k to n, do the following:
            For each j from k to m, update dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-k][j], dp[i][j-k])

Return: The minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size n x m is stored in dp[n][m].
