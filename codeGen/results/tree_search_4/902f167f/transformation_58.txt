===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation and memoization. Create a 2D dictionary dp to store the minimum number of squares for each possible rectangle size, and fill it in iteratively.

The state could be dp[(i, j)] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j, where 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= m. The base case is when i = 1 or j = 1, in which case we only need one square.

dp[(i, j)] represents the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j. For each cell dp[(i, j)], consider all possible square sizes k such that 1 <= k <= min(i, j). The transition relationship is: dp[(i, j)] = min((i-k)*(j-k) / k^2 + dp.get(((i-k), (j-k)), float('inf')) for k in range(1, min(i, j)+1)).

Memoization is achieved using the get method to store and retrieve values from the dictionary. This avoids redundant computations by reusing previously computed values.
