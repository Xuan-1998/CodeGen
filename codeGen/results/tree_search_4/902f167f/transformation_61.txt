===BEGIN PLAN===
Create a 2D array dp with dimensions n+1 by m+1, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j. The base case is when i = 1 or j = 1, in which case we only need one square.
For all rectangles of size i x j, consider all possible square sizes k such that 1 <= k <= min(i, j). Then, dp[i][j] = min(dp[k-1][j-k+1] + (i-k+1)*(j-k+1) / k^2 for k).
To avoid calculating the same subproblem multiple times, use memoization to store the results of subproblems as they are solved and look up their solutions when needed in subsequent calculations.
For edge cases, handle rectangles with dimensions 0 x j or i x 0 separately, as these do not need any squares. Set dp[0][j] = 1 for all j and dp[i][0] = 1 for all i.
