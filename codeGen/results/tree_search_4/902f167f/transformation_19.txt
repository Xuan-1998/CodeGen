===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, you can use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming and memoization.

State: dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j.

Base case: dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 1 for any i or j (since the empty rectangle can be tiled with one square)

Induction step:
- If i <= k and j <= k, then dp[i][j] is 1 if i == k and j == k, otherwise it's the minimum of:
    - The minimum number of squares required to tile the top-right subrectangle of size (i-k) x (j-k), plus one
    - The minimum number of squares required to tile the bottom-left subrectangle of size (i) x (j-k), plus one

Memoization: Use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems so they can be reused.

Edge cases:
- If n or m is less than 1, return an error message
- If n == 0 and m == 0, return 1
