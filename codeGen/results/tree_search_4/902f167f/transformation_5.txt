===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach, where you calculate the minimum number of squares for sub-rectangles and store them in a 2D array to avoid redundant calculations.

The state expression could be defined as dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j.
dp[i][j] = min(dp[max(0, i-k)][j] + dp[i][max(0, j-l)]) + 1
where k and l are the side lengths of the smallest square that can be placed in the top-left corner of the sub-rectangle.

Design a recursive function that utilizes memoization through the use of a lookup dictionary.
The base cases for the recursion could be when i or j is less than or equal to 0, which means there's no more rectangle left to tile and we return 0 as the minimum number of squares required.

The plan should also include checks for edge cases such as when n or m is 1, in which case the answer would be 1.
The function could take two parameters, i and j, representing the current dimensions of the sub-rectangle.
The lookup dictionary could store the results for each sub-rectangle calculated during the recursion to avoid redundant calculations.
