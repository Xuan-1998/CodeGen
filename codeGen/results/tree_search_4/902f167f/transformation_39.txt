===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Create a 2D array to store the minimum number of squares for each possible rectangle size, and fill it in iteratively.

Let the state be dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j, with 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= m.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + dp[k][j-1]) for k in range(1, min(i, j)+1) or dp[i][j] = min(min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]), ceil(sqrt(i * j)))

Use memoization with dynamic programming by defining a function that recursively calculates the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle.
