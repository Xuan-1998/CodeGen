===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation and memoization.

Create a 3D array dp[n+1][m+1][max_size] where max_size is the maximum possible side length of squares. Initialize all values to infinity, except for base cases:
- When i or j is 0, set dp[i][j][0] = 0 (no squares needed)
- For smaller square sizes, calculate the minimum number of squares needed by considering all possible larger square sizes and their positions within the rectangle.

Fill in the dp array iteratively, using memoization to store and reuse previously computed values. This is done to avoid redundant calculations.

For each cell dp[i][j][k], consider all possible positions of a k*k square within the rectangle:
- If there's no room for a k*k square, set dp[i][j][k] = dp[i][j][k-1] (no change)
- Otherwise, calculate the minimum number of squares needed by considering two options: 
  - Place the k*k square at the top-left corner
  - Place the k*k square elsewhere

Return dp[n][m][max_size] as the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile the given rectangle.
