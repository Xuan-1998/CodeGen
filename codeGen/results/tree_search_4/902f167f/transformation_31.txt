===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, you can use a top-down approach with memoization and dynamic programming.

State: dp[i][j] is the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile the remaining area of size i x j.

Function: dp(i, j) = 1 + min(dp(min(i, j-1)), dp(min(i-1, j))) where gcd(i, j) is the side length of the square that can be placed in the remaining area i - 1, j - 1.

Memoization: Use a dictionary dp to store the results of subproblems as keys and their corresponding values as values. Initialize dp with default value infinity for all possible inputs.

Base case: dp(0, 0) = 0, since no squares are needed to tile an empty rectangle.

Step-by-step approach:

1. Calculate the side length gcd(i, j) that can be placed in the remaining area i - 1, j - 1.
2. Calculate min(dp(min(i-1, j)), dp(min(i, j-1))) as the minimum number of squares needed to tile the remaining areas.
3. Return 1 + the calculated value as the minimum number of squares required to tile the original rectangle.

Edge cases: Handle inputs where i or j is 0 separately, since these are base cases that do not require any square placement.
