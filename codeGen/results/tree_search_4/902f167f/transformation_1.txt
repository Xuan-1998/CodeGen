===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach, where you calculate the minimum number of squares for sub-rectangles and store them in a 2D array to avoid redundant calculations.

The state expression could be defined as dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares required to tile a sub-rectangle of size i x j, and the transition relationship could be: dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j] + 1) for k in range(i+1), where k is the side length of the square.

Create a dictionary-based memoization system where you store the calculated values of dp[i][j] for future references.

In addition, consider initializing the base cases as follows: dp[0][j] = j and dp[i][0] = i, which represent the minimum number of squares required to tile rectangles with zero width or height.

This is because in these cases, you can simply fill the rectangle with horizontal or vertical strips of squares, respectively.

To further improve the plan, consider using a top-down dynamic programming approach where you first calculate the minimum number of squares for smaller sub-rectangles and then use those values to compute the minimum number of squares for larger sub-rectangles.

This can help reduce the time complexity of the algorithm by avoiding redundant calculations.

The plan does not explicitly include edge cases, but it takes into account the base cases where one or both dimensions are zero. It also does not consider the possibility of having multiple solutions with different numbers of squares, but this could be handled by keeping track of the minimum number of squares found so far and updating it accordingly.
