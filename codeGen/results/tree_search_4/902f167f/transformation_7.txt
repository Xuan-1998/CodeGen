===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach, where you calculate the minimum number of squares for sub-rectangles and store them in a 2D array to avoid redundant calculations.

The state expression could be defined as dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j.
dp[i][j] is 1 if i or j is 0, otherwise it's the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j.

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with memoization, where you iteratively calculate the minimum number of squares for sub-rectangles and store the results in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.
The transition relationship could be: dp[i][j] = min(dp[max(0, i-k)][k] + 1) for all k <= j

Edge cases should include calculating the base cases where i or j is 0.
