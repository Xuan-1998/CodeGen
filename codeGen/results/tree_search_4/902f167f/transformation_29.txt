===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, you can use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming.

State: dp[i][j] is the minimum number of integer-sided squares that tile the top-left i x j rectangle, for 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m.

Let's break down the plan step by step:

1. Create a 2D array dp of size n+1 x m+1 to store the results of subproblems.
2. Initialize dp[0][j] = j and dp[i][0] = i for all i, j because you can tile the area with squares of side length 1 in these cases.
3. For each cell (i, j) in the array, consider the minimum number of squares that can fit in this area:
    a. If the remaining area is too small to fit any square, just add 1 to the result for the top-left (i-1) x (j-1) rectangle.
    b. Otherwise, try fitting all possible squares of side length k = 1 to min(n, m), and choose the one that gives the minimum number of squares required to tile the remaining area.
4. The final answer is stored in dp[n][m].
