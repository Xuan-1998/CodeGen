===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, you can use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming. Define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j.

The base case is when i or j is less than or equal to 0, in which case dp[i][j] is set to 0 because no squares are needed.

For larger values of i and j, calculate dp[i][j] as the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile a rectangle of size (i-k) x (j-k), where k is the side length of the largest square that can fit in the top-right corner. This is because the remaining area after placing such a square is smaller and has been solved before.

Use a list comprehension with a dictionary to store the results as you go along, rather than storing all possible subproblems at once.
