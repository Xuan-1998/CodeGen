===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach, where you calculate the minimum number of squares for sub-rectangles and store them in a 2D array to avoid redundant calculations.

The state expression could be defined as dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][l] + 1) for all k <= i and l <= j, where the minimum is taken over all possible integer-sided square sizes that can fit in the sub-rectangle of size (i-k) x (j-l).

Use a nested loop to fill up the dp array in bottom-up manner, starting from small sub-rectangles and gradually moving towards larger ones.

For the base case, initialize dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, as no squares are needed to tile an empty rectangle. Similarly, initialize dp[i][0] = 0 for all i, as no squares are needed to tile a vertical line.

The final answer is simply the value of dp[n-1][m-1].
