===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach, where you calculate the minimum number of squares for sub-rectangles and store them in a 2D array to avoid redundant calculations.

Let dp[i][j] represent the minimum number of squares required to tile the sub-rectangle from (0, 0) to (i, j).

The base case could be dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] being 0 for all i, j because an empty rectangle or a rectangle with one side can't be tiled by any squares.

Then, iterate over the sub-rectangles from top-left to bottom-right, updating dp[i][j] based on the minimum number of squares required to tile the sub-rectangle from (0, 0) to (i-1, j-1), and the remaining area of size (i, j) - (i-1, j-1).

For each cell in the dynamic programming table, you can calculate the minimum number of squares required by considering three cases:
- If i is less than or equal to j, consider placing a square with side length min(i, j) in the top-left corner.
- If j is less than or equal to i, consider placing a square with side length min(j, i) in the left-top corner.
- Otherwise, consider not placing any squares and recursively calculating the minimum number of squares required for the sub-rectangle.

Finally, return dp[n][m] as the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile the given rectangle.
