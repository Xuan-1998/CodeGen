===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation and memoization. Create a 2D dictionary to store the minimum number of squares for each possible rectangle size.

Let the state be dp[(n, m)] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size n x m, where 1 <= n <= 13 and 1 <= m <= 13.

dp[(i, j)] = min(dp[(k, k)] + (i-k*k)*(j-k*k)) for k in range(min(i, j)**0.5+1)

To improve the plan, consider using a more efficient way to calculate the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j.

One potential issue with the plan is that it does not handle edge cases properly. For example, what if n or m is 1? In this case, we can simply return 0 because a single cell can be tiled by a square of side length 1.

To include edge cases in the plan, we can add additional conditions to handle these special cases.

Another potential issue with the plan is that it assumes that all squares are used completely. However, what if there are remaining cells after tiling the rectangle? We should consider this case and adjust our calculation accordingly.

Here is the updated version of the plan:
