===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Create a 2D array to store the minimum number of squares for each possible rectangle size, and fill it in iteratively.

Let the state be dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j, with 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= m.
dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 0 for all i, j

For 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= m, use the following recurrence relation:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1 (if i and j are both even or both odd)

Create a 2D table with n+1 rows and m+1 columns, where the cell at row i and column j represents the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j.

Fill in the base cases: dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 0 for all i, j

Iterate through the table from top-down or bottom-up (bottom-up is recommended for tabulation):
For i = 1 to n and j = 1 to m:
    If i and j are both even or both odd, update dp[i][j] using the recurrence relation
    Otherwise, leave dp[i][j] unchanged

The final answer will be stored in dp[n][m]
