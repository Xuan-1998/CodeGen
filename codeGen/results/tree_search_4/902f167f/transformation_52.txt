===BEGIN PLAN===
Create a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1), where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j. Initialize all values in dp to be infinity, except for the base cases when either i or j is equal to 1, in which case we only need one square.
Fill in the array iteratively by considering all possible ways to tile each rectangle with smaller rectangles. For each rectangle of size i x j:
    If j >= k and i >= l, then consider tiling the top-left part (i-l) x (j-k) with a square of side length min(l,k), and recursively calculate the minimum number of squares required for the remaining rectangle of size (i-l) x (j-k). Add 1 to this result if it's smaller than the current value in dp[i][j], because we're adding one more square.
    If j >= k, then consider tiling the top part i x (j-k) with a square of side length k, and recursively calculate the minimum number of squares required for the remaining rectangle of size i x (j-k). Add 1 to this result if it's smaller than the current value in dp[i][j], because we're adding one more square.
    If i >= l, then consider tiling the left part (i-l) x j with a square of side length l, and recursively calculate the minimum number of squares required for the remaining rectangle of size (i-l) x j. Add 1 to this result if it's smaller than the current value in dp[i][j], because we're adding one more square.
Return dp[n][m] as the minimum number of squares required to tile the original rectangle.
