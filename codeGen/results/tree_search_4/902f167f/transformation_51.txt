===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Create a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1) to store the minimum number of squares for each possible rectangle size, and fill it in iteratively.

Let the state be dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j, with 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= m. The base case is when either i or j is equal to 1, in which case we only need one square.

For larger rectangles (i > 1 and j > 1), consider all possible ways to tile the rectangle by placing a square of size k x k at the top-left corner, where k is an integer that divides both i and j. This can be done by iterating over all possible values of k from 1 to min(i, j).

For each value of k, calculate the remaining area that needs to be tiled: (i-k) x (j-k). If this remaining area can be tiled using a square of size p x p where p is an integer that divides both (i-k) and (j-k), then update dp[i][j] with the minimum number of squares required to tile the remaining area plus 1.

Repeat this process for all possible values of k, and keep track of the minimum number of squares required to tile the rectangle. This can be achieved by using a temporary variable temp to store the minimum value found so far, and updating dp[i][j] with temp when a new minimum is found.

Finally, return dp[n][m] as the result, which represents the minimum number of integer-sided squares that tile the given rectangle.
