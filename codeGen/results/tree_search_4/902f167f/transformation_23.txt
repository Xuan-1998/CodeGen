===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, you can use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming. Define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j.

1. Initialize the base cases: 
   - For all i and j, if i or j is less than 1, set dp[i][j] to 0, because you can't fit any squares into a rectangle with zero area.
   
2. Fill in the dp array using a bottom-up approach:
   - Iterate through each possible square side length k from 1 to min(i, j).
   - For each k, calculate the remaining width and height of the rectangle: w = i - k and h = j - k.
   - If the remaining rectangle has an area greater than 0, recursively call dp[w][h] to get the minimum number of squares needed for that rectangle, and add 1 to account for the current square.
   
3. Return the value in the bottom-right corner of the dp array as the final answer.
