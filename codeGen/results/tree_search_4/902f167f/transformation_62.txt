===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Create a 2D array to store the minimum number of squares for each possible rectangle size, and fill it in iteratively.

The state could be dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j, with 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= m. The base case is when i = 1 or j = 1, in which case we only need one square.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j. Consider all possible square sizes k such that 1 <= k <= min(i, j), and transition relationships: dp[i][j] = min(dp[k-1][j-k+1] + (i-k+1) for k in range(min(i, j)+1)).

Implement a recursive function with memoization to solve the problem, taking advantage of overlapping subproblems. Use memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computation.

Fill the dp array row by row or column by column, depending on the problem constraints. Start from the base cases (i = 1 or j = 1) and fill in the dp array iteratively.

After filling the dp array, return dp[n][m] as the minimum number of squares required to tile the given rectangle.
