===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Create a 2D array dp to store the minimum number of squares for each possible rectangle size, and fill it in iteratively.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j, with 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= m.
The base case is when either i or j is equal to 1, in which case we only need one square.

Fill in the dp array using two nested loops that iterate over i and j from 2 to n and m respectively. For each cell dp[i][j], consider all possible squares that can be placed at the top-left corner of the rectangle of size i x j. The minimum number of squares required is the minimum of:
- The minimum number of squares required for a smaller rectangle of size (i-k) x j, plus one square of size k x k.
- The minimum number of squares required for a smaller rectangle of size i x (j-l), plus one square of size l x l.

This process continues until the entire dp array is filled. The final value in the bottom-right corner of the dp array represents the minimum number of squares required to tile the original rectangle.
