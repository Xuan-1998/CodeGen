===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, you can use a top-down approach with memoization and dynamic programming.

State: dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j.

dp[i][j] is calculated by considering all possible placements of a square of side length k (where 1 <= k <= min(i, j)), and choosing the one that minimizes dp[i-k][j-((i-k)%k)] (to handle cases where the remaining area is not fully tiled). This calculation handles both horizontal and vertical tile placements.

Use a dictionary to store the memoized values, where the key is a tuple of (i, j) and the value is the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j. Initialize dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] to 0 for all i, as these represent the base cases (tiling a row or column with no remainder).

Edge cases: The plan already handles edge cases where one dimension is zero.

The plan has potential issues with handling cases where i or j is less than 1, but this can be handled by adding an additional check in the calculation of dp[i][j].
