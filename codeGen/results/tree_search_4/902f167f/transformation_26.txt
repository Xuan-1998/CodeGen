===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, you can use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming. Define a function that takes the dimensions of the rectangle as input, and use dynamic programming to fill up a 2D array.

State: dp[i][j] is the minimum number of squares needed to tile a rectangle of size i x j.
Define dp[0][j] = 1 for all j, because an empty rectangle can be tiled with zero squares. Define dp[i][0] = 1 for all i, because a rectangle with no columns can be tiled with one square.

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of squares needed to tile a rectangle of size i x j.
For each cell dp[i][j], consider two possibilities: 
- The last square used has side length j. In this case, you need at least one more square with side length 1 to fill up the remaining part (i-j). So, dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[j-1][k] where k varies from 0 to i-j.
- The last square used has side length i. In this case, you don't need any more squares because the rectangle is fully tiled. So, dp[i][j] = 1.
Fill up the bottom row and rightmost column of dp with ones, because these cells represent rectangles that can be tiled with one square.

The minimum number of squares needed to tile a rectangle of size n x m is stored in cell dp[n][m].
