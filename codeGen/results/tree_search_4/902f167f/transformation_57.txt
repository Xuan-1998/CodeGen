===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Create a 2D array to store the minimum number of squares for each possible rectangle size, and fill it in iteratively.

The state could be dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j, with 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= m. The base case is when i = 1 or j = 1, in which case we only need one square.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j, with 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= m. For each cell dp[i][j], consider all possible square sizes k such that 1 <= k <= min(i, j). The transition relationship is: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-k][j-1] + 1 for k in range(1, min(i, j) + 1)).

Use a bottom-up approach with tabulation, filling in the 2D array dp to store the minimum number of squares required to tile each possible rectangle size. Start from the base case (i = 1 or j = 1), and then fill in the rest of the cells iteratively based on the transition relationship.
