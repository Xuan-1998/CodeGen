===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, you can use a dynamic programming approach with memoization.

State: dp[i][j] is the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile the remaining area (i - 1) x (j - 1).

For each cell dp[i][j], calculate the minimum value among all possible ways to place a square in the remaining area:

* Place a square with side length equal to gcd(i, j) in the remaining area i - 1, j - 1.
* Recursively solve the problem for the remaining areas (i - k) x (j - k), where k is the side length of the placed square.

The minimum value among all possible ways is the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile the remaining area.

Consider implementing a bottom-up approach by iterating over all possible subproblems in a systematic order. This can be done by initializing the dp table and then filling it up row by row or column by column.

Edge cases:
- Handle the base case where i = 1 or j = 1, as there is only one way to tile these areas (i.e., no squares are needed).
