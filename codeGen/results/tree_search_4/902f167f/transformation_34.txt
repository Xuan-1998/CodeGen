===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, you can use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming and memoization.

Define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile an i x j rectangle. The base case is when i or j is 1, in which case the answer is 0 because a single integer-sided square can cover an area of 1x1.

State: dp[i][j] is the minimum value among all possible ways to place a square in the remaining area.

Let's define a recursive function f(i, j) that returns the minimum number of squares required to tile an i x j rectangle. The base case is when i or j is 1, and the recursive case is:

f(i, j) = min(f((i-k))[j]) + 1, where k is a side length that divides both i and j.

Use a dictionary to store the memoized values and update it recursively.

The main function should initialize the dp array and fill it using the f function. Finally, return dp[n][m] as the answer.
