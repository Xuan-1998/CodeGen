===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach, where you calculate the minimum number of squares for sub-rectangles and store them in a 2D array to avoid redundant calculations.

The base case could be dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] being 0 for all i, j because an empty rectangle or a rectangle with one side can't be tiled by any squares.

Let's consider a possible transition: if we place a square of size k x k in the top-left corner of the sub-rectangle, it will leave a smaller rectangle of size i-k and j-k. We can then apply the same logic recursively for this smaller rectangle.

Create a 2D array dp with dimensions (n+1) x (m+1) to store the minimum number of squares required for each sub-rectangle.

Let's define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j. The transition function can be:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-k][j-k] + 1, where k is a possible square side) for all i, j

The plan includes edge cases: dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] are correctly set to 0.

Overall, the plan seems correct. However, it might be beneficial to add more detail on how to handle the base case and the transition function.
