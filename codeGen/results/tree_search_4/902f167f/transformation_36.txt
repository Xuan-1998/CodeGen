===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, you can use a top-down approach with memoization and dynamic programming. Define a function that takes the dimensions of the rectangle as input, and use memoization to store the results of subproblems so they can be reused.

State: dp[i][j] is the minimum value among all possible ways to place a square in the remaining area.
Let f[i][j] be the minimum number of squares required to cover the top-left i x j rectangle. Then, 
f[i][j] = min(f[(i-k) // sqrt(k)][(j-k) // sqrt(k)]) + 1, where k is a side length that divides both i and j.

Create a recursive function that fills up a 2D array in a bottom-up manner, using previously computed results. Start from the base cases: f[0][0] = 0 (no squares needed to cover an empty rectangle).

Use memoization to store the results of subproblems as you compute them. This will prevent redundant computations and speed up the solution.

Finally, return f[n][m], which represents the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile the given rectangle.
