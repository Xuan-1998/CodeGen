===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Create a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1) to store the minimum number of squares for each possible rectangle size, and fill it in iteratively.

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j. The base case is when either i or j is equal to 1, in which case we only need one square (dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 1 for all i and j).

Then dp[i][j] is the minimum between two cases:
- one plus the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size (i-1) x j
- one plus the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x (j-1)

Use memoization by defining a function minSquares(i, j) that returns the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j, and store the results in a dictionary dp_dict to avoid redundant calculations.

Fill in the 2D array dp iteratively using the above recurrence relation. The final answer is stored in dp[n][m].
