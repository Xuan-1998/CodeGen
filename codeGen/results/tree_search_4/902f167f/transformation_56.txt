===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Create a 2D array to store the minimum number of squares for each possible rectangle size, and fill it in iteratively.

Let dp[i][j] represent the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j, with 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= m. The base case is when either i or j is equal to 1, in which case we only need one square.

The recurrence relation is: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1

Dynamically generate the dp table by iterating over all possible rectangles sizes from top-left to bottom-right, using the previously calculated values to fill in the current cell, and return the value at the bottom-right corner as the minimum number of squares required to tile the original rectangle.

Let's initialize the base cases: for i = 1 or j = 1, dp[i][j] = 1

Then, iterate over all possible rectangles sizes from top-left to bottom-right:
for i in range(2, n+1):
    for j in range(2, m+1):
        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1

Finally, return the value at the bottom-right corner: dp[n][m]
