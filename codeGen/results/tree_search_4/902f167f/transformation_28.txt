===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, you can use a top-down approach with memoization and bottom-up dynamic programming.

State: dp[i][j] is the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile the top-left i x j rectangle, for 0 <= i <= n and 0 <= j <= m. The base case is when i = 1 or j = 1, in which case the minimum number of squares is 1.

Memoize the function call dp(i-1, j) if i > 1 to avoid redundant calculations.
Memoize the function call dp(i, j-1) if j > 1 to avoid redundant calculations.

For each cell dp[i][j], consider all possible ways to place a square in the remaining area. The minimum number of squares required is the one that uses the smallest number of additional squares to cover the entire area.
The final answer will be stored in dp[n-1][m-1].
