===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used to build up solutions to the problem from smaller problems.

DP states: Let dp[i] represent the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the first i elements of the sequence.

Initially, dp[0] = 0 because no elements have been deleted. Then for each element in the sequence:
    If this element is not equal to its previous and next elements (i.e., it's a standalone element), then delete this element along with all elements equal to it, which gives dp[i+1] = dp[i]-1.
    Otherwise, don't delete this element. The maximum number of points that can be earned so far remains the same.

Finally, return dp[n], which is the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the entire sequence.
