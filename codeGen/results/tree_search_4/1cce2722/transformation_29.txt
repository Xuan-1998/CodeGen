===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization can be used to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computation.

dp[i] = max(dp[k-1] + (k-i) for k in range(i))

Formulate a dynamic programming solution by defining a recursive function that calculates the maximum number of points earned for each subsequence, then use memoization to store the results. 

For each i from 0 to n-1:
    If i == 0 or dp[i] is not computed yet:
        Initialize dp[i] with the maximum value for i
        For k from i to n-1:
            Calculate the number of points earned by deleting elements up to index i and then all equal to a[k+1] and a[k-1]
            Update dp[i] with the maximum between its current value and dp[k] + (k-i)
    Return max(dp)

This plan correctly identifies memoization as the key to solving this problem. It also correctly defines the recursive function that calculates the maximum number of points earned for each subsequence.

The potential issue with the plan is that it does not handle edge cases properly. For example, what if a[k+1] or a[k-1] is out of bounds? The plan should be updated to handle these cases.

To improve the plan, we can add checks to ensure that k+1 and k-1 are within the bounds of the array before performing calculations. We can also initialize dp[i] with the maximum value for i instead of 0.
