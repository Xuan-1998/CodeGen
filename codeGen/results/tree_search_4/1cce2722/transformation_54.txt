===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used to build up solutions to the problem from smaller problems.

DP states: Define dp[i][j] as the maximum number of points that can be earned if we are currently at the i-th element and the last deleted elements were at indices j-1, j+1. The base case would be when i is 0 or n-1, where we start or end the sequence respectively.

To improve the plan, we need to specify how to fill up the dp table. One way to do this is by iterating over each element in the array and for each element, consider all possible choices of deleting elements and update the dp table accordingly.

The updated version of the plan would be:
