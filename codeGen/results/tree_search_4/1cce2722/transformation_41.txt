===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used to build up solutions to the problem from smaller problems.

DP states: Let dp[i] represent the maximum number of points that can be earned by the i-th element in the sequence.
Let dp[i] = max(dp[j] + (i - j) for j such that 1 <= j < i and a_j == a_i].
Initialize dp[0] to 0, and then fill up the table using the recurrence relation:
dp[i][j] = max(dp[k][j-1] + (i-k) for k such that 1 <= k < i and a_k == a_i].

However, there is an issue with this plan. The problem statement does not allow deleting elements along with all elements equal to ak + 1 and ak - 1. Instead, it only allows deleting the current element along with its adjacent elements (i.e., elements equal to ai + 1 and ai - 1).

To correct this, we need to update the recurrence relation as follows:

DP states: Let dp[i] represent the maximum number of points that can be earned by the i-th element in the sequence.
Let dp[i] = max(dp[j] + (i-j) for j such that 1 <= j < i and a_j == a_i - 1 or a_j == a_i + 1].
Initialize dp[0] to 0, and then fill up the table using the recurrence relation:
dp[i] = max(dp[j] + (i-j) for j such that 1 <= j < i and a_j == a_i - 1 or a_j == a_i + 1].

This corrected plan should correctly calculate the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the sequence.
