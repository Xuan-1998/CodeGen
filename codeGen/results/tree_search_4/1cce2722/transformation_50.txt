===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used to build up solutions to the problem from smaller problems.

DP states: Define dp[i][j] as the maximum number of points that can be earned if we are currently at the i-th element and the last deleted elements were at indices j-1, j+1. The base case would be when i is 0 or n-1, where we start or end the sequence respectively.

Define dp[i][j] as the maximum number of points that can be earned if we are currently at the i-th element and the last deleted elements were at indices j-1, j+1, considering only the elements before the i-th one.

Apply a bottom-up approach by filling up the dp table row by row:

    Initialize the first and last rows of the dp table to have all values equal to 0.
    For each row starting from the second row:
        Iterate through each column except the first and last columns.
        Calculate the maximum number of points that can be earned if we are currently at the i-th element and the last deleted elements were at indices j-1, j+1, considering only the elements before the i-th one.
        Update dp[i][j] with the calculated value.

The plan appears to be correct. However, it is important to consider edge cases such as when there are less than 3 elements in the sequence, and ensure that the base case handling is accurate.
