===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used to build up solutions to the problem from smaller problems.

DP states: Let dp[i][k] represent the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting the k-th element and all elements equal to it. Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum number of points that can be earned by considering the first i elements and making j moves so far, where a move is defined as either deleting an element or not.

Initialize the dp table with zeros: dp = [[0 for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]

Fill up the dp table row by row from bottom to top:

For i from 2 to n:
    For k from 1 to i:
        If a[i] == a[k-1], then consider deleting the k-th element and all elements equal to it. Calculate the maximum number of points that can be earned in this case: dp[i][k] = dp[k-1][0] + (i-k+1)
        Otherwise, do not delete the k-th element, so dp[i][k] = dp[i-1][k]
    Update memo with dp[i][0]

Finally, return the maximum number of points that can be earned by considering all elements: max(dp[n][j] for j in range(n+1))
