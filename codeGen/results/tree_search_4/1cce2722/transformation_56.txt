===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used to build up solutions to the problem from smaller problems.

DP states: Define dp[i][j] as the maximum number of points that can be earned if we are currently at the i-th element and the last deleted elements were at indices j-1, j+1. The base case would be when i is 0 or n-1, where we start or end the sequence respectively.

Define dp[i][j] as the maximum number of points that can be earned if we are currently at the i-th element and the last deleted elements were at indices j-1, j+1, considering all possible choices for deleting elements. 

Fill up the dp table using a nested loop, considering all possible choices for deleting elements and updating the maximum number of points accordingly.

Update: For each state dp[i][j], consider two possibilities:
    1. Delete element at index i
    2. Do not delete element at index i

If we choose to delete element at index i, then we will have to update the last deleted elements j-1 and j+1 accordingly.

Update base case: When i is 0 or n-1, the maximum number of points that can be earned is always 0.
