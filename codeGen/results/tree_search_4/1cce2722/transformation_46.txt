===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used to build up solutions to the problem from smaller problems.

DP states: Let dp[i] represent the maximum number of points that can be earned by the i-th element in the sequence.
Let dp[i] = max(dp[j] + 1 for j such that 1 <= j < i and |a_i - a_j| == 1].

The correct condition should be |a_i - a_j| in {k-1, k} instead of just 1.

Implement tabulation by initializing dp with all zeros and then iteratively update each dp[i] based on the values of dp[j] for j < i.
Finally, return dp[n] as the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the sequence.
