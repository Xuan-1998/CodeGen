dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) if i > 0 else 0
The state can represent the current position i in the sequence and the maximum number of points earned up to this point. The transition relationship captures the idea of deleting an element and all its neighbors, updating the maximum number of points accordingly.

Employ top-down memoization using recursion, storing the maximum points earned for each subsequence in a dictionary or cache.
Consider pruning branches that have already been computed to avoid redundant computation.
To handle edge cases, consider initializing dp[0] to 0 and handling the base case where i is 0.
