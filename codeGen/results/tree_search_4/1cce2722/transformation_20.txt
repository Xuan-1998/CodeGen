===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization can be used to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computation.

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], sum(a[:i]) - dp[i-1]) if i > 0 else 
        sum(a[:1])

The dynamic programming problem can be viewed as a longest increasing subsequence problem, where the goal is to find the maximum number of elements that can be removed while maintaining the property that no two adjacent elements are equal.

Implement a top-down dynamic programming approach where you recursively compute the maximum sum of points earned by deleting elements from the sequence, and memoize the results to avoid redundant computation. 

At each step, consider including or excluding the current element ak in the optimal subsequence.
If the current element is excluded, then the maximum number of points earned is the same as the maximum number of points earned for the remaining sequence a[i+1:].

If the current element is included, then it should be different from its neighbors. So, consider including or excluding the next two elements ak-1 and ak+1.
The base case is when i == 0, in which case dp[0] = sum(a[:1]) because we can't delete any elements.
