===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be divided into subproblems of smaller size, such as finding the maximum points for a sequence of length n-1 and n-2.

DP State: dp[i] = max number of points that can be earned from the first i elements
Initialize dp[0] = 0

For each element a[i]:
    If a[i] is not equal to any previous element:
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1 (since we can delete all previous elements)
    Else:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-k]) where k is the minimum index such that a[k] != a[i]
        (since we can't delete any elements equal to a[i])

Create a memoization function to store the intermediate results of subproblems and use it to optimize the computation.

For edge cases:
    n = 0: return 0
    n = 1: return 1
