===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used to build up solutions to the problem from smaller problems.

DP states: Let dp[i] represent the maximum number of points that can be earned by the i-th element in the sequence. Let dp[i] = max(dp[j] + (i - j) for j such that 1 <= j < i and a_j == a_k], where k is the index of the element to be deleted.

Create a 2D table dp[][] with dimensions n x n, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting the i-th element.

Update: The plan seems correct. However, it's necessary to consider edge cases such as when i = j or a_j != a_k. Also, it might be helpful to initialize dp[][] with values that represent the base case for the problem, which is deleting all elements or not deleting any elements at all.
