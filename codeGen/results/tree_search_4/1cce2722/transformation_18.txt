===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[n-i]) if i > 0 else 0
The key insight is that at each position i, we have two options: 
1. We can remove the element at i and all elements equal to it from both sides (i.e., a[k+1] for k >= i-1 and a[k-1] for k <= i+1), in which case our maximum score would be dp[i-1].
2. We can leave the element at i as is, in which case our maximum score would be dp[n-i], since we are essentially removing the elements from the other side.
Memoize the maximum sum of points earned by deleting elements up to the ith position and the maximum sum of points earned by deleting elements from the (n-1)th position onwards.
