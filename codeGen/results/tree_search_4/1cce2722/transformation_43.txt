===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used to build up solutions to the problem from smaller problems.

DP states: Let dp[i] represent the maximum number of points that can be earned by considering all elements in the sequence up to index i. Then:

dp[1] = 0
dp[i] = max(dp[j] + (i - j) for j such that 1 <= j < i and a_j == a_k] for k ranging from j-2 to j+2

Utilize memoization with a dictionary dp where dp[i] stores the result for subproblem i, and only computes each result once.
