===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used to build up solutions to the problem from smaller problems.
DP states: Let dp[i] represent the maximum number of points that can be earned by the i-th element in the sequence.
Let dp[i] = max(dp[j] + 1 for j such that 1 <= j < i and |a_i - a_j| == 1). This is because deleting an element along with its neighbors will earn you one point.
Memoize the function that calculates dp[i] as the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the sequence up to index i, considering only valid indices j such that 1 <= j < i and |a_i - a_j| == 1.
Finally, return dp[n] as the answer, which represents the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the entire sequence.
