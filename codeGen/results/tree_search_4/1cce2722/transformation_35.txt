===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization can be used to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computation.

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[k] + (k-i) + (n-k) - (a[i] - a[k]) for k in range(i) where k > 0 and k < i)

Apply memoization to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computation

Handle edge cases: For the first element, initialize dp[0] = 0. For the last element, consider the maximum points that can be earned by deleting elements equal to a[n-1] - 1 and a[n-1] + 1.
