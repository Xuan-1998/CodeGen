===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used to build up solutions to the problem from smaller problems.

DP states: Let dp[i][k] represent the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting the k-th element and all elements equal to it.

Consider dp[i][k] to be the maximum number of points that can be earned when k elements are deleted from the sequence's first i elements.

Using a 2D array where dp[i][k] represents the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting the k-th element and all elements equal to it. For each element ai, consider two options:
    1. Delete ai.
    2. Don't delete ai.

The dynamic programming approach will work as follows:

Let dp[i][k] represent the maximum number of points that can be earned when k elements are deleted from the sequence's first i elements.
For each element ai:
    1. If ai is not equal to any previously seen element, then consider two options: delete ai or don't delete ai.
    2. If ai is equal to some previously seen element, then it should be paired with that element and deleted.

To fill the dp array, for each i from 0 to n-1:
    For each k from 0 to i:
        Calculate the maximum number of points earned by deleting the k-th element and all elements equal to it.
        Update the dp[i][k] value accordingly.

Finally, return the maximum value in the dp array as the answer.
