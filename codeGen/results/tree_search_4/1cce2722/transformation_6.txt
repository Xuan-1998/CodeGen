===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be divided into subproblems of smaller size, such as finding the maximum points for a sequence of length n-1 and n-2.
DP State: The maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the sequence ending at index i
Use bottom-up dynamic programming to fill a 2D table with dimensions (n, max_value_in_sequence) based on previously computed values.

Let dp[i][k] be the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the sequence ending at index i and having the element ai equal to k.
For i = 1 to n-1:
    For k = 1 to max_value_in_sequence:
        If ak+1 exists in the sequence, then the player has two options: either delete the current element or delete the subsequent elements. 
        dp[i][k] is updated by choosing the maximum of these two options.
For i = n-1 to 0:
    For k = 1 to max_value_in_sequence:
        If ak+1 exists in the sequence, then the player has two options: either delete the current element or delete the preceding elements. 
        dp[i][k] is updated by choosing the maximum of these two options.
Finally, return the value at dp[0][1] as this represents the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the sequence.
