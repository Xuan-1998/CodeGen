===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization can be used to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computation.

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], sum(dp[k] + (k-i) + (n-k) - (a[i]-a[k])) for k in range(i))

To formulate the dynamic programming solution, consider the following options:
    Memoize the function that calculates dp[i], storing previously computed values.
    Use a two-pointer technique to efficiently iterate over the array and calculate the maximum points.

The updated plan considers edge cases by ensuring that the dynamic programming calculation handles all possible valid indices i in the range [1, n].
