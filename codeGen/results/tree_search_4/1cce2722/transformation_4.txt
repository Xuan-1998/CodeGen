===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be divided into subproblems of smaller size, such as finding the maximum points for a sequence of length n-1 and n-2.

DP State: Minimum index i such that a[i] is the first element in the sequence not equal to any previous element
DP State: Maximum number of points earned by deleting elements up to index i

To implement memoization, you can use a dictionary where the key is a tuple representing the current sequence and the value is the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from that sequence.

For each subproblem, you need to consider all possible deletion choices (deleting an element or not) and choose the one that maximizes the points. This can be done by iterating over the sequence and for each element, calculating the maximum points if it is deleted, and then choosing the maximum of these values.

To avoid recalculating the same subproblems multiple times, you can use memoization to store the results of previously solved subproblems.

The plan does not consider edge cases such as an empty input sequence. You should handle this case by returning 0 or a specific value indicating that no points can be earned.

The plan seems correct and provides a clear direction for solving the problem. To improve it, you could add more details about how to calculate the maximum number of points for each subproblem and how to handle edge cases.
