Memoization can be used to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computation.

Let dp[i] be the maximum number of points earned for the subsequence ending at index i.
For each i, consider all possible choices: deleting or not deleting ai.
For k in range(i), there are two cases:
- If we delete ai, then the maximum number of points earned is dp[k] + (k-i) + (n-k) - (ai - ak).
- If we don't delete ai, then the maximum number of points earned is dp[i-1].

The final answer will be dp[n-1].
