===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used to build up solutions to the problem from smaller problems.

DP states: Let dp[i][k] represent the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting the k-th element and all elements equal to it.
Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum number of points that can be earned by considering the first i elements and making j moves so far, where a move is defined as deleting an element along with all its left and right neighbors.

DP states:
    1. If k = 0 or k = i-1, then dp[i][k] = dp[i-1][k-1]
    2. Otherwise, consider the maximum number of points that can be earned by moving to either a[i-k-1] or a[i+k+1], whichever is higher.
DP states:
    1. Let p = max(p, dp[i-1][k-1])
    2. If a[i-k-1] > a[i+k+1], then return dp[i-1][k-1]
    3. Else, return dp[i-1][k+1]

DP states:
    1. Initialize dp[0][j] = 0 for all j
    2. For i from 1 to n, do the following:
        a. If j is even, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
        b. Else, calculate dp[i][j] using the above formula

Finally, return dp[n][0]
