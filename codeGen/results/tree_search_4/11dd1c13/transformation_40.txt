===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up the table in a bottom-up manner by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum.

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path that ends at cell (i, j). Initialize dp[0][j] for each column j as the value of grid[0][j], since there's no previous row to consider.

For each cell (i, j), calculate dp[i][j] as the minimum sum of a falling path that ends at cell (i, j) by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum. This can be done by iterating over all columns k in the previous row, calculating dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j], and taking the minimum.

Use a dictionary to memoize the results of subproblems and store them in a cache for efficient lookups.

Finally, return dp[n-1][0] as the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts that starts at the top-left corner and ends at the bottom-right corner.
