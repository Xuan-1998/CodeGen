===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up a 2D table in a bottom-up manner by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum.

Create a 2D table dp of size (n x n) where dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of falling paths for each cell (i, j) in the grid.

Transition relationship:
    - If i is the first row, set dp[0][j] = grid[0][j] for all j.
    - For all other rows i > 0 and columns j:
        + Initialize a variable min_sum to positive infinity.
        + Iterate over all columns k in the previous row (i-1).
            * If the column k in the previous row does not have a matching column in the current row, calculate dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][k], 0) and update min_sum if necessary.
        + Return dp[i][j] as the minimum sum of falling paths for cell (i, j).

Fill up the table by iterating over all cells in the grid. For each cell (i, j), use the transition relationship to calculate dp[i][j].

Return the minimum value in the last row of the table as the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts.
