===BEGIN PLAN===
From a given grid, identify a subproblem that can be solved by finding the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts for each row. Use this subproblem to build a table in a bottom-up manner.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = min(sum of falling path starting from cell (i, j)) for all 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for all 0 <= k < n

Implement memoization using a dictionary where the key is the state (i, j) and the value is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts starting from cell (i, j).

To improve this plan, consider initializing dp[i][j] to infinity if i == 0. This ensures that the base case for memoization is handled correctly.

Also, consider handling edge cases where grid[i][j] == 0. In this scenario, it's possible that a falling path with non-zero shifts might not be possible.

The plan does include edge cases such as initializing dp[i][j] to infinity if i == 0 and handling the case where grid[i][j] == 0.
