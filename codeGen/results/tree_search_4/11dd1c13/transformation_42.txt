===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up the table in a bottom-up manner by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(n)
    dp[i][0] is initialized as 0, since there's no choice when reaching the first column
    for each cell (i, j) where 0 < j < n:
        update dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(n)
        considering all possible paths that end at cell (i-1, k)

Using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing the first row of the table and then iterating from the second row to the last row, filling up the table as you go.
    initialize dp[0][j] = grid[0][j] for j in range(n)
    iterate from i=1 to m-1:
        for each cell (i, j):
            update dp[i][j] based on the minimum sum of paths ending at the previous row
        return dp[m-1][0]
