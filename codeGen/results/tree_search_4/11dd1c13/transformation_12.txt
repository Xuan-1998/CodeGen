===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be 'dp[i][j]' where 'i' is the current row and 'j' is the column index, representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the (i, j)th cell. The base case would be when i or j reaches the size of the grid.

The recurrence relation could be dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) where k ranges over all column indices such that |i - k| > 0.

Consider a bottom-up approach by iterating through each cell from the last row to the first and updating the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts as you go.

Use a 2D array 'dp' where dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the (i, j)th cell.
