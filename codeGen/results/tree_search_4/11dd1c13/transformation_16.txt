===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be 'dp[i][j]' where 'i' is the current row and 'j' is the column index, representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the (i, j)th cell. The base case would be when i or j reaches the size of the grid.
dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the ith cell in the current column.

dp[i][j] could represent the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts that ends at cell (i, j), considering all possible previous cells.
For each cell (i, j), calculate dp[i][j] as the minimum between:
    1. The sum of the current cell and the minimum sum of a falling path from the top cell to the cell above it in the same column
    2. The sum of the current cell and the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts that ends at the cell above it

Apply memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary called 'memo'.
