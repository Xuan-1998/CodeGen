===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be 'dp[i][j]' where 'i' is the current row and 'j' is the column index, representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the (i, j)th cell. The base case would be when i or j reaches the size of the grid.

For each cell in the grid, consider all possible previous columns that can lead to this cell without violating the condition that no two elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column. This means considering only columns with a non-zero shift from the current column.

dp[i][j] could be defined as min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for all k such that j - k > 0 and k >= 0 (to avoid out-of-bounds indices). The minimum sum is then taken over all possible previous columns.

Memoize the state expression using a dictionary to store the computed values, and use it to avoid redundant computation.

The plan can be improved by considering the property that dp[i][j] does not depend on the current column j, but only on the row i. This means we can iterate over the rows of the grid instead of the cells, which reduces the time complexity from O(m*n) to O(m).
