===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up the table in a top-down manner by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum.
Create a memoization table dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path ending at cell (i, j).
Transition relationship: dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][min(j, 2*n-j)] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(i-1), where min(j, 2*n-j) ensures that we don't consider columns that have a matching column in the current row.
Fill up the table by iterating from top to bottom and from left to right. For each cell (i, j), calculate dp[i][j] based on the minimum sum of falling paths ending at cells above it that do not share a column with the current cell.
Finally, return dp[n-1][0], which represents the minimum sum of a falling path starting from the top-left corner and ending at the bottom-right corner.
