===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be 'dp[i][j]' where 'i' is the current row and 'j' is the column index, representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the (i, j)th cell. The base case would be when i or j reaches the size of the grid.

The state transition equation could be:
dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0]
for i > 0

For all other cells:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k-1] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(1, j+1)

Use a dictionary to store the intermediate results and update the dp values based on the previous rows.

To improve this plan, we could sort the columns by their values before filling up the dp table. This would allow us to take advantage of non-zero shifts more effectively.

One potential issue with this plan is that it assumes that the minimum sum of a falling path can always be achieved by moving down or left. However, in some cases, moving diagonally might also be possible and could result in a smaller sum.

The plan does not include edge cases. We need to add checks for when i or j reaches the size of the grid.
