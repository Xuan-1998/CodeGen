===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up the table in a bottom-up manner by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum.
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k]) + grid[i][j] for k in range(n) if k != j
The state is the row and column indices, and the transition relationship is the choice of which cells to add to the path below it.

The base case is when we reach the first row (i.e., i == 0). In this case, dp[i][j] = grid[0][j].
We then fill up the table in a bottom-up manner by iterating over all rows and columns.
For each cell, consider all possible paths ending at that cell and choose the one with the minimum sum.

This approach is correct for solving the problem. To improve it, we can use memoization to store the values of dp[i][j] as they are computed, so that we don't have to recompute them multiple times.
We should also handle edge cases such as when the grid has only one row or column, in which case the minimum sum is simply the sum of all elements in the single row or column.
