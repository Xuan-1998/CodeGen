===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up the table in a bottom-up manner by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k]) + grid[i][j] for k in range(n) if k != j
The state is the row and column indices, and the transition relationship is the choice of which cells to add to the path below it. However, this plan doesn't take into account the constraint that no two elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column.

To fix this, we need to consider all possible paths with non-zero shifts. This can be done by introducing a new variable dp[i][j][k], where k is the shift value (0 or 1). This will allow us to keep track of the minimum sum of paths that have shifted up or down.

dp[i][j][0] = min(dp[i-1][k][0]) + grid[i][j] for k in range(n) if k != j and dp[i][j][1] = min(dp[i-1][k][1]) + grid[i][j] for k in range(n) if k != j

The base case would be when i is 0, where dp[0][j][0/1] = grid[0][j].

Then, we fill up the table by considering all possible paths with non-zero shifts and choosing the one with the minimum sum.

Finally, we return min(dp[n-1][k][0]) + grid[n-1][k] for k in range(n) if k != j as the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts.
