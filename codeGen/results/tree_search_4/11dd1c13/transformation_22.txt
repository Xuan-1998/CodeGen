The state expression could be 'dp[i][j]' where 'i' is the current row and 'j' is the column index, representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the (i, j)th cell. The base case would be when i or j reaches the size of the grid.
dp[i-1][0] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the ith row.

For each cell dp[i][j], consider all possible moves: moving down one cell and then shifting right, or moving diagonally down-right. The minimum sum is achieved when we choose the move that gives us the smallest sum.
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(j, -1, -1) if i > 0

Employ a top-down approach using recursion and memoization to fill up the dp table. For each cell, calculate its minimum sum by considering all possible moves.

To avoid redundant calculations, use memoization to store previously calculated values of 'dp[i][j]' in a separate table 'memo'. When calculating 'dp[i][j]', first check if it has been calculated before and return the stored value if so. This way, we ensure that each cell is only calculated once.
