===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up the table in a bottom-up manner by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum.

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum sum of a path ending at cell (i, j).
dp[0][j] = grid[0][j] for all j
Because there's no previous row to consider in the first row.

For i > 0 and j in range(n), formulate dp[i][j] as:
dp[i][j] = min([grid[i-1][k] + dp[i-1][k]] for k in range(n) if k != j)
This represents the minimum sum of a path ending at cell (i, j) by considering all possible paths from above rows that do not use the same column as the current cell.

The minimum sum is chosen by taking the smallest value from the list comprehension.

Finally, return dp[-1][-1] as it will hold the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts.
