===BEGIN PLAN===
From a given grid, identify a subproblem that can be solved by finding the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts for each column. 
Use this subproblem to build a table in a bottom-up manner.

The state expression could be dp[j][i] = min(sum of falling path ending at cell (j, i)) for all 0 <= j < m and 0 <= i < n.
dp[j][i] = min(dp[j-1][k] + grid[j][i]) for k in range(m)

Create a list comprehension to calculate the minimum sum at each position based on the previous row's values.
