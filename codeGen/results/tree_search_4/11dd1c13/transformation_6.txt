===BEGIN PLAN===
From a given grid, identify a subproblem that can be solved by finding the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts for each row. Use this subproblem to build a table in a bottom-up manner.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = min(sum of falling path starting from cell (i, j)) for all 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m.

For each cell dp[i][j], consider the possible non-zero shifts. If the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts is obtained by shifting down, then it would be dp[i-1][j] + grid[i][j]. However, if the minimum sum is obtained by shifting left or right, the problem becomes more complex and would require additional computations.

Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming values, where each cell represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts for that row and column.

Initialize dp[0][j] = grid[0][j] for all 0 <= j < m. This is because there are no previous rows to consider when calculating the minimum sum of a falling path starting from the first row.

For each cell dp[i][j], calculate the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts by considering the possible non-zero shifts and the values in the previous rows.

The final answer would be the minimum value in the last row, which represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts for the entire grid.
