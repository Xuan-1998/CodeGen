===BEGIN PLAN===
From a given grid, identify a subproblem that can be solved by finding the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts for each row. 
Use this subproblem to build a table in a bottom-up manner.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = min(sum of falling path starting from cell (i, j)) for all 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m.
dp[0][j] = grid[0][j]
for i > 0:
    for j in range(m):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j] for k in range(m))
        else:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][m-1-k] + grid[i][j] for k in range(m))

Memoize the calculation by storing the results in a dictionary as you iterate through the grid.
