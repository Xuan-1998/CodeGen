===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be 'dp[i][j]' where 'i' is the current row and 'j' is the column index, representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the (i, j)th cell. The base case would be when i or j reaches the size of the grid.

Create a separate dp array to store the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to each cell in the grid.
for i in range(1, n):
    for j in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            dp[i][j] = grid[0][j]
        else:
            dp[i][j] = min([dp[i-1][k-1] + grid[i][j]] for k in range(1, j+1))
