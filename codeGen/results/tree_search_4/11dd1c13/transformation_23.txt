===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be 'dp[i][j]' where 'i' is the current row and 'j' is the column index, representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the (i, j)th cell. The base case would be when i or j reaches the size of the grid.

The transition relation could be:
dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0]

For j > 0:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(j, -1, -1) if i > 0
