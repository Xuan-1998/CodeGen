===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up the table in a bottom-up manner by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path ending at cell (i, j).

Fill the 2D table column by column. For each cell (i, j), consider the two possibilities: either choose an element from row i-1 and shift it to column j, or choose an element from row i-1 and shift it to column j+1.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][i-1] + grid[i][k]) for k in range(min(j, n))

Use this recurrence relation to fill up the table. The base case is when i=0, which means we have reached the top row of the grid and can only choose an element from that row.
