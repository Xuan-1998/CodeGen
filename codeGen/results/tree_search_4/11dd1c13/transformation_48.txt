===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up the table in a bottom-up manner by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k]) + grid[i][j], where k is any column in the previous row that does not have a matching column in the current row.
Initialize dp with infinity, then gradually update it as you consider all possible paths. This way, we ensure that we only consider valid paths.

For each cell in the dp table, we iterate over all columns j in the previous row and find the one that doesn't have a matching column in the current row. We then add the value of the current cell to the minimum sum of the path ending at the previous cell and update dp[i][j].

Finally, return the minimum sum of the last row as the result.
