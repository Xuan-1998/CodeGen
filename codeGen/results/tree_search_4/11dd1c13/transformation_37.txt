===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up the table in a bottom-up manner by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(n) and j != i % n
where dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path ending at cell (i, j). The state is updated as 
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(n), where n is the number of columns.
Use a 2D array to store the DP table and another 1D array to store the cumulative sums of each row.

Let's iterate through all cells (i, j) from bottom up. For each cell dp[i][j], 
we only need to consider paths ending at previous non-diagonal cells dp[i-1][k] where k != j.
The minimum sum of a falling path ending at dp[i][j] is the sum of this cell and the minimum sum of any previous non-diagonal cell.
If i % n == j, then we don't need to consider this cell as it will be considered in next iteration.
