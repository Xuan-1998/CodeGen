===BEGIN PLAN===
From a given grid, identify a subproblem that can be solved by finding the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts for each row. Use this subproblem to build a table in a bottom-up manner.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = min(sum of falling path starting from cell (i, j)) for all 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m.

Create a table of size (n x n) where n is the number of rows in the grid, and initialize each cell with a large value. Then, fill up the first row of the table by iterating over all columns and setting each cell to the corresponding element in the grid.

For each subsequent row i > 0:
  Iterate over all columns j such that 0 <= j < m.
  For each column j:
    Initialize min_sum = INF (a large value).
    Iterate over all columns k such that 0 <= k < m and k != j.
      Calculate the sum of a falling path starting from cell (i, j) with non-zero shift to cell (i-1, k). 
      If this sum is smaller than min_sum, update min_sum = dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j].
    Set dp[i][j] = min_sum.
  The minimum sum of a falling path starting from any cell in the last row is the result.
