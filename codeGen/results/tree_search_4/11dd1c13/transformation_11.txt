===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be  'dp[i][j]' where 'i' is the current row and 'j' is the column index, representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the (i, j)th cell. The base case would be when i or j reaches the size of the grid.
The transition relation could be defined as:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for all k such that 0 <= k < j and no two elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column
Use both memoization and tabulation together, where memoization is used to store the intermediate results and tabulation is used to fill up the rest of the dynamic programming table.
The final answer would be dp[grid_size-1][0], where grid_size is the size of the grid.
