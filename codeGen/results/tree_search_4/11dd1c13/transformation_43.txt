===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up the table in a bottom-up manner by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(n) where n is the number of columns
This represents the minimum sum of a falling path that includes the current cell (i, j) and ends at cell (i-1, 0)

Initialize dp table with all values as infinity

dp[0][j] = grid[0][j] for all j in range(n) since there's only one way to get a sum of 0 from the first row

For i in range(1, m):
    For j in range(n):
        For k in range(n):
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j], dp[i][j])
Return the minimum value in the last row (dp[m-1][j]) as the result

Employ memoization with a recursive function that utilizes a dictionary to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
