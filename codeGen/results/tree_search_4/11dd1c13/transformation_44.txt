===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up the table in a bottom-up manner by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(n) if i > 0
dp[0][j] = grid[0][j]
n is the size of the grid

Update the state dp[i][j] by considering all possible shifts (from 0 to n-1) and choosing the one with the minimum sum.

Fill up the table in a bottom-up manner, starting from the last row and moving towards the first row.

After filling up the table, return dp[0][0], which represents the minimum sum of a falling path that starts at the top-left corner of the grid.
