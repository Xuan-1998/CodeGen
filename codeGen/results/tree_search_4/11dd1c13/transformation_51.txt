===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k]) + grid[i][j], where k is any column in the previous row that does not have a matching column in the current row and has a non-zero shift.
Initialize the table with base case dp[0][j] = grid[0][j].
Fill up the rest of the table in a row-by-row manner, considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum.

For each cell (i, j) in the table:
  For each column k in the previous row that does not have a matching column in the current row and has a non-zero shift:
    Calculate dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k]) + grid[i][j].
  Choose the minimum sum among all possible paths.
