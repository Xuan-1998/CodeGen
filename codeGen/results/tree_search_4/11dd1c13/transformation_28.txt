===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up the table in a bottom-up manner by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k]) + grid[i][j] for k in range(n) if k != j
Consider the current cell as a start of a path, and the minimum sum is the sum of the current cell's value plus the minimum sum of all cells below it that are not in the same column.

dp[0][j] = grid[0][j]
Initialize the first row to be the same as the input grid

for i in range(1, n):
    for j in range(n):
        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k]) + grid[i][j] for k in range(n) if k != j
Consider all possible paths starting from each cell below and choose the one with the minimum sum

return min(dp[n-1])
Return the minimum sum of the last row as the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts
