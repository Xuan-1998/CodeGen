===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up the table in a bottom-up manner by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum.

Create a 2D DP table with size (n+1) x m, where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. Initialize dp[i][j] as infinity for all i and j.

Fill up the first row of the DP table by setting dp[0][j] to grid[0][j] for all j, since there's only one way to reach each cell in the first row (i.e., from the top).

For each cell dp[i][j], consider all possible paths ending at that cell. For each path, find the minimum sum by considering all possible shifts and selecting the one with the minimum sum.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(m)
where m is the number of columns.

The state is updated as follows: dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path ending at cell (i, j).

Fill up the rest of the DP table by considering all possible paths and updating the state accordingly.

The answer to the problem is dp[n-1][0], which corresponds to the minimum sum of a falling path starting from the top-left corner and ending at the bottom-right corner.
