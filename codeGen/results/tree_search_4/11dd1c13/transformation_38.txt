===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up the table in a bottom-up manner by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum.

Initialize the base case for the first row by setting dp[0][j] = grid[0][j] for j from 0 to m-1.
dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path ending at cell (i, j).
The state is updated as:
    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(m)
where m is the number of columns.

To handle edge cases, consider what happens when i=0 or j=0. Since the first row does not have a previous row to compare with, we can initialize dp[0][j] = grid[0][j] as before.
However, for j=0 (i.e., the first column), we need to update dp[i][j] differently because there is no previous column to compare with. One way to handle this is by considering the minimum sum of all possible paths ending at cell (i, 0) and updating dp[i][0] accordingly.
