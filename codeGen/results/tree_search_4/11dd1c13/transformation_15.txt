===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be 'dp[i][j]' where 'i' is the current row and 'j' is the column index, representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the (i, j)th cell. The base case would be when i or j reaches the size of the grid.

For each cell (i, j), consider all possible previous cells that can lead to this cell. Since we're only considering non-zero shifts, we can ignore cells in the same column as the current cell. This means we can only consider cells from the previous row and cells in different columns from the current row.

dp[i-1][j-1] + grid[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the ith cell in the current column. We need to minimize this sum over all possible choices of previous cells that can lead to this cell.

Use a 2D array 'dp' where dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the (i, j)th cell.

For each cell (i, j), calculate dp[i][j] as the minimum sum of a falling path that ends at this cell. This can be done by iterating over all possible previous cells and taking the minimum sum of the paths that end at these cells, plus the value of the current cell.

The final answer will be the value in the bottom-right corner of the 'dp' array, which represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the bottom-right cell.
