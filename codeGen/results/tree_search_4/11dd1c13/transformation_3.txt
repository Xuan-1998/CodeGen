===BEGIN PLAN===
From a given grid, identify a subproblem that can be solved by finding the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts for each row. This can be done by iterating through each cell in the grid and considering all possible paths that start from this cell. 

The state expression could be dp[j][i] = min(sum of falling path starting from cell (i, j)) for all 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m.

To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can use a bottom-up approach, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path starting from cell (i, j) for all 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m. 

dp[i][j] = min(dp[j-1][i] + grid[i][j]) for all 0 <= i < m

Memoize this process by filling the dp table in a bottom-up manner, starting from the first row. For each cell (i, j), consider all possible paths that start from this cell and choose the one with the minimum sum.

Once the dp table is filled, return dp[0][j] for the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts.
