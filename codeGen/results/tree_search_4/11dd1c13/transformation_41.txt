===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up the table in a top-down manner by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(n)

The transition relationship is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(n). This ensures that we consider all possible paths and choose the one with the minimum sum.

To avoid recalculating the same subproblems multiple times, use memoization by storing the results of function calls in a dictionary.

The base case is dp[0][j] = grid[0][j], since there's no previous row to consider when we're at the first row. This ensures that our dynamic programming solution handles edge cases correctly.

To improve the plan, we can use memoization to avoid recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.
This plan does not include edge cases explicitly, but it handles them implicitly by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum.
