===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up the table in a bottom-up manner by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the minimum sum.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k]) + grid[i][j] for k in range(n) if k != j
    Consider the current cell as a start of a path, and the minimum sum is the sum of the current cell's value plus the minimum sum of all cells below it that are not in the same column.

dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][n-1] + grid[i][0]
dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j]

For each cell, consider all possible paths starting from that cell. If it's the first row or column, only one path is possible (the leftmost or topmost element). Otherwise, consider all cells in the previous row/column that are not in the same column and choose the one with the minimum sum.
