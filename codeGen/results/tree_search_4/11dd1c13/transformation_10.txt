===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be 'dp[i][j]' where 'i' is the current row and 'j' is the column index, representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the (i, j)th cell. The base case would be when i or j reaches the size of the grid.

The transition from dp[i-1][k] to dp[i][j] could be improved by considering all possible previous column indices k such that no two elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column. This can be achieved by initializing a set 'prev_cols' with all unique column indices in the current row, and then iterating through each column index k in 'prev_cols', updating dp[i][j] with min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j], dp[i][j]).

Tabulate the dynamic programming table by initializing all cells with infinite value at first, then iteratively update each cell based on its previous values. The final answer would be the minimum value in the last row of the dp table.

The plan seems to correctly capture the essence of the problem and its constraints, but it may not handle edge cases such as an empty grid or a grid with all zero elements. These edge cases should be explicitly handled before the main logic is executed.
