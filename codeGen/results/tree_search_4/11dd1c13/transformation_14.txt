===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be 'dp[i][j]' where 'i' is the current row and 'j' is the column index, representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the (i, j)th cell. The base case would be when i or j reaches the size of the grid.

dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the ith cell in the current column.
Consider a bottom-up approach by iterating through each cell from the last row to the first and updating the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts as you go.

Dynamically create and update a 2D array 'dp' as you iterate through each cell from the last row to the first, storing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts in dp[i][j] for the ith cell.

For each cell, consider all possible previous cells that could be chosen to minimize the sum. This would include cells one column to the left or two columns to the right (since we want non-zero shifts).

The plan is correct and provides a good starting point for solving the problem. However, it's missing some edge cases.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
