The state expression could be  'dp[i][j]' where 'i' is the current row and 'j' is the column index, representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the (i, j)th cell. The base case would be when i or j reaches the size of the grid.
dp[0][0] = grid[0][0], assuming the top-left cell is always chosen
dp[i-1][0] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the ith row.

for i in range(grid_size):
    for j in range(grid_size):
        if i > 0:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(j, -1, -1)

return dp[-1][-1]
