===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k]) + grid[i][j] for k in range(n//2), where n is the size of the grid
Use bottom-up dynamic programming by initializing a 2D table with zeros and filling it up row by row, using the recurrence relation dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k]) + grid[i][j] for k in range(n//2)
Initialize dp[0][j] = grid[0][j] for j in range(n), as the minimum sum of a falling path starting at the first row is simply the value of each cell
Fill up the table, and finally return dp[n-1][j] for j in range(n), which represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts
