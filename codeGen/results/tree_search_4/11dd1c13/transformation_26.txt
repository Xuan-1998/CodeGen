The state expression could be 'dp[i][j]' where 'i' is the current row and 'j' is the column index, representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the (i, j)th cell. The base case would be when i or j reaches the size of the grid.
dp[i-1][0] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the ith row.

state transition: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][max(0, j-grid[i-1][k-1])] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(grid.shape[1]) if i > 0
dp[i-1][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the ith row.
mem = {(i, j): float('inf') for i in range(len(grid) + 1) for j in range(len(grid[0]) + 1)}
state transition: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][max(0, j-grid[i-1][k-1])] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(grid.shape[1]) if i > 0
dp[i][0] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the ith row.
state transition: dp[i][0] = min(dp[i-1][k-1] + grid[i][0]) for k in range(grid.shape[1])
