===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be 'dp[i][j]' where 'i' is the current row and 'j' is the column index, representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the (i, j)th cell. The base case would be when i or j reaches the size of the grid.

The recurrence relation could be dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for all k such that 0 <= k < j and k != j - 1. This represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts that ends at cell (i, j), considering all possible previous cells.

The tabulation could be done using a 2D array 'dp' where dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the (i, j)th cell. The base case would be when i or j reaches the size of the grid.

The final answer would be dp[grid_size-1][0], which represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts that starts at the top left corner and ends at the bottom right corner.
