===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be 'dp[i][j]' where 'i' is the current row and 'j' is the column index, representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the (i, j)th cell. The base case would be when i or j reaches the size of the grid.
dp[i-1][0] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from the top cell to the ith row.

for i in range(1, len(grid)):
    for j in range(len(grid[0])):
        if i > 0:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k-1] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(1, j+1)
