===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem requires calculating OR operation for all values of i from 0 to 314159, a natural idea is that subproblems can be overlapping. For example, the result for i=10 can be used in the calculation for i=11.

Consider defining dp[i] as the sum of OR operations for all j from 0 to i-1, and base case is dp[0] = 0.
dp[i] is the sum of OR operations for all j from 0 to i, considering the base case dp[0] = 0

DP array initialized with zeros as dp[i] = 0 for all i

For each i from 1 to 314159:
    Calculate dp[i] as the sum of OR operations for all j from 0 to i-1
    Update dp[i+1] as the sum of OR operations for all j from 0 to i, and then add dp[i]
    
Calculate the final answer as (dp[314159] + a) ^ b
