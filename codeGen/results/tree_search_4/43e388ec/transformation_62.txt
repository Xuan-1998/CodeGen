Tabulation could be an option since we need to calculate a cumulative sum and memoization might not be efficient here.

Let's define the state as DP[i] = ((a >> i) ^ b) % mod, where mod is 10^9+7. This represents the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on a and the binary shift to the left operation on b for all values of i from 0 to k.

The base case is DP[0] = (a ^ b) % mod, since there's no need to perform any shifts for i = 0.

Memoize the dynamic programming state DP[i] by storing the intermediate results in a dictionary and reusing them when needed. This ensures that each subproblem is computed only once, reducing the time complexity.

The final answer would be the cumulative sum of all these intermediate results from i = 0 to k.
