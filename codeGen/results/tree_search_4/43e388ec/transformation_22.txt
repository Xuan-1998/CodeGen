===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem requires calculating OR operation for all values of i from 0 to 314159, a natural idea is that subproblems can be overlapping. For example, the result for i=10 can be used in the calculation for i=11.

Consider defining dp[i] as the sum of OR operations for all j from 0 to i-1, and base case is dp[0] = 0.

dp[i] is the sum of OR operations for all j from 0 to i, considering the base case dp[0] = 0

To handle overlapping subproblems, we can use memoization using a dictionary where keys are indices and values are computed results. 

Let's calculate dp[i] as the sum of OR operations for all j from 0 to i-1, plus either b or (b<<1) depending on whether i is even or odd.

The base case dp[0] = 0 ensures that our calculation starts with a correct value. The dynamic programming approach ensures that we avoid redundant calculations and only need to store the results of subproblems once.

We can then initialize dp array with all values being 0, set dp[0] = 0, and calculate the rest of the array iteratively from left to right.

The final answer will be dp[314159], which is the sum of OR operations for all i from 0 to 314159.
