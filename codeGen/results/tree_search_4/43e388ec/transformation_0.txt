===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem requires calculating OR operation for all values of i from 0 to 314159, a natural idea is that subproblems can be overlapping. For example, the result for i=10 can be used in the calculation for i=11.

Let dp[i] denote the sum of OR operations up to index i, and define dp[0] as 0 (base case).

dp[i] = 0 if i >= log2(max(a, b)) else dp[i-1] + ((a >> i) | (b << (i+1))) % (10**9+7)

Dynamic programming with tabulation: use a list to store the DP values and iterate from 0 to 314159, updating each value based on the previous one.
