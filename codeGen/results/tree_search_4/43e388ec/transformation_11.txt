===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression can be defined as dp[i] = (dp[i-1] ^ b) if i > 0, where dp[0] = a ^ b. This way, we avoid recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.

To calculate dp[i], we only need to know dp[i-1]. If i is greater than 0, then we can use the previously calculated value of dp[i-1].

The base case would be dp[0] = a ^ b. This value can be used to start the dynamic programming process.

Once dp[i] is calculated, it can be used to calculate dp[i+1]. This way, we avoid recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.

We can use a vector to store the values of dp from 0 to 314159. The final answer would be the sum of all the elements in this vector modulo 10^9 + 7.

The plan does not include edge cases specifically, but it should work for all valid inputs.
