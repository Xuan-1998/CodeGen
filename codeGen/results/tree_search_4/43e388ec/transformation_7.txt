===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i] denote the sum of OR operations up to index i, and define dp[0] as 0 (base case).

State: dp[i]
Transition:
dp[i] = ((a^(b>>(i-1)))) % (10**9+7) + dp[i-1]

This is because the OR operation for i can be calculated using the result of the previous OR operations and the current value of b.

The plan seems correct, as it uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the sum of OR operations. However, one potential issue is that the array dp needs a large amount of memory to store all values from 0 to 314159. This can be mitigated by only calculating the necessary values and storing them in a smaller array.

Additionally, to handle edge cases, we need to make sure that the plan handles the case when i = 0 correctly.
