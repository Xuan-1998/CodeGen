===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem requires calculating OR operation for all values of i from 0 to 314159, a natural idea is that subproblems can be overlapping. For example, the result for i=10 can be used in the calculation for i=11.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i] = (dp[i-1] ^ (b << (i-1))) if i > 0; otherwise, dp[0] = a ^ b.
This is because the OR operation can be broken down into two parts: the part that was calculated previously and the new part that involves shifting b to the left.

Create a memoization table with initial value as 0, where dp[i] = (dp[i-1] ^ (b << (i-1))) if i > 0; otherwise, dp[0] = a ^ b.
The final answer is then calculated by summing up all dp[i] values modulo 10^9+7.
