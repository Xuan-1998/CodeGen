DP[i] = (a ^ ((b >> i) & 1)) % (10**9 + 7), where DP[0] = a ^ b and base case is DP[0].
The key observation here is that the OR operation with the most significant bit of b determines the outcome of the XOR operation.
This allows us to calculate each element in the DP array independently, without needing to consider previous elements.
DP[i] = (a ^ ((b >> i) & 1)) % (10**9 + 7), where DP[0] = a ^ b and base case is DP[0].
To reduce the number of operations, we can calculate two values at once: DP[i] and DP[i-1]. This way, we only need to perform one XOR operation per iteration.
DP[i] = (a ^ ((b >> i) & 1)) % (10**9 + 7), where DP[0] = a ^ b and base case is DP[0].
Finally, calculate the sum of all elements in the DP array modulo 10^9+7 as the final answer.
