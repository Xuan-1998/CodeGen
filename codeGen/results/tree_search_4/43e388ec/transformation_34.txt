===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure arises because the sum modulo 10^9+7 can be computed by adding the results of smaller subproblems.

The state expression is dp[i][j], where j is the j-th bit of b. The value of dp[i][j] is the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the (i+j)-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a - 1.

Let dp[i][j] be the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the (i+j)-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a - 1. Then, the state transition relation is dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][(j+1)%b] + a[i]^b[(i+j)%b].

Implement memoization using a dictionary with keys as tuples of the form (i, j) and values as the computed sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the (i+j)-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a - 1.

Note that this plan does not consider edge cases. We need to add checks to ensure that i, j are within valid ranges.

Correctness: The plan looks correct in terms of identifying the optimal substructure and state transition relation. However, it's essential to handle edge cases and validate inputs.

Improvement: To further optimize the solution, we can consider using bitwise operations to compute the exclusive OR operation and binary shift operation. This might reduce the time complexity.

Potential issues: The plan does not account for invalid input values or edge cases. We need to add checks to ensure that the input values are within valid ranges.
