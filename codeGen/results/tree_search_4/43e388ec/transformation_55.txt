===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation could be an option since we need to calculate a cumulative sum and memoization might not be efficient here.

The state can be defined as DP[i] = ((DP[i-1] << 1) ^ b) % (10**9 + 7), with base case being DP[0] = a ^ b.
DP[i] represents the cumulative sum of OR(a, b << i) for all values of i from 0 to i.

The state can be updated as follows:
- If i is a multiple of 31, then update DP[i+1] = (a ^ (b >> (i // 31))) % (10**9 + 7).
- Otherwise, update DP[i+1] = ((DP[i-1] << 1) ^ b) % (10**9 + 7).

Applying memoization using a dictionary to store and reuse previously computed values.

The final answer can be calculated as the sum of all DP[i] values from i=0 to i=314159, modulo 10**9+7.
