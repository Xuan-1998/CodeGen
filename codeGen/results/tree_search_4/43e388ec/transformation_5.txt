===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i] denote the sum of OR operations up to index i, and define dp[0] as 0 (base case).
The idea is to keep track of the results for each index and add the new result based on whether the corresponding bits in a and b are 0 or 1.
For any i > 0, calculate dp[i] = dp[i-1] + ((a & 1) ^ (b >> 1)) % (10^9 + 7), where a & 1 extracts the least significant bit of a, and b >> 1 performs the binary shift to the left on b.
Employ a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming to calculate the cumulative sum.
To avoid recalculating the same subproblems multiple times, keep track of the previous result dp[i-1] and add the new result based on whether the corresponding bits in a and b are 0 or 1.
This way, you can efficiently calculate the sum modulo (10^9 + 7) of the OR operations for all values of i from 0 to 314159.
