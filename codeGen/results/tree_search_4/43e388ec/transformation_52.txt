===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation could be an option since we need to calculate a cumulative sum and memoization might not be efficient here.

DP[i] = ((a ^ (b >> i)) + DP[i-1]) % (10**9 + 7), where DP[0] = a ^ b.
The base case is DP[0]. We only need to store the last few values in the DP array since we're calculating based on previous results.

DP[i] = ((a ^ (b >> i)) + DP[i-1]) % (10**9 + 7) for i from 0 to 314159
