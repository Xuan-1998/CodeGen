===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure arises because the sum modulo 10^9+7 can be computed by adding the results of smaller subproblems.

State: dp[i] represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 for all values of i from 0 to a - 1, considering the current bit of a.
dp[i] represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 for all values of i from 0 to b - 1, considering the current bit of b.

Use a dictionary or hashmap to store intermediate results for memoization, where the key is the current state of a and/or b, and the value is the computed sum modulo 10^9+7. The states can be represented as tuples of (a, b, carry), where carry is the carry bit from the previous iteration.

For each subproblem, iterate over all possible values of i and j, considering the current bits of a and b. Compute the new state after updating the bits according to the problem statement, and look up the result in the dictionary if it has been computed before (memoization). If not, compute the result using the recurrence relation.

Finally, sum up the results for all possible states to get the total sum modulo 10^9+7.
