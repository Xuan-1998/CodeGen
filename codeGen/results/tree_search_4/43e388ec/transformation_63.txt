1. Initialize a 2D array DP where DP[i][j] represents the XOR of a and left-shifted b for all values of i from 0 to 314159, and j = 0 to bits in a.

Base case: DP[0][i] = (a & (1 << i)) ? (a - (1 << i) + b) : a

Transition relationship: DP[i][j] = (a & (1 << i)) ? (DP[i-1][j] ^ (b >> i)) : DP[i-1][j]

2. Calculate the cumulative sum by iterating over all values of i from 0 to 314159 and j = 0 to bits in a.

3. Return the modulo 10^9+7 result of the cumulative sum as the final answer.
