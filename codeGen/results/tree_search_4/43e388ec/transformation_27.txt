The optimal substructure arises because the sum modulo 10^9+7 can be computed by adding the results of smaller subproblems.

State: dp[i] represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 for all values of i from 0 to a - 1, considering the current bit of a.
dp[i] represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 for all values of i from 0 to min(a, b) - 1, considering the current bits of a and b.

Create a dynamic programming table dp where dp[0] = 0. Then, for each i from 1 to min(a, b), calculate:
dp[i] = (b & 1) * (2^i - 1) + dp[i-1]

Finally, return the value of dp[min(a, b)] modulo 10^9+7.
