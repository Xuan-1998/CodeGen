===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure arises because the sum modulo 10^9+7 can be computed by adding the results of smaller subproblems.

The state expression is dp[i][j], where j is the j-th bit of b. The value of dp[i][j] is the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the (i+j)-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a - 1.

Consider the dynamic programming approach where dp[i][j] is the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the (i+j)-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a - 1. Then, the state transition relation is dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + a[i]^b[(i+j)%b].

Memoize using list comprehension with key as tuple of (i, j) and value as the computed sum modulo 10^9+7.

For initialization, set dp[0][j] to b[j] for all j. This is because when i is 0, the OR operation reduces to just considering the bits of b.

The dynamic programming approach ensures that we only need to compute each dp[i][j] once and store it for future reference.

To improve this plan, consider using a more efficient memoization data structure such as a dictionary or an array instead of a list comprehension. This can significantly reduce the time complexity of the solution.

In terms of potential issues with the plan, one thing to consider is that the state transition relation assumes that the values of i and j are non-negative. If this is not the case, you may need to add additional logic to handle these edge cases.

The plan does include edge cases such as when a or b is 0.
