===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure arises because the sum modulo 10^9+7 can be computed by adding the results of smaller subproblems.
dp[i] represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the binary shift to the left operation on the (i-1)-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a - 1, considering the current bit of a.
dp[i] = dp[i-1] + ((a & (1 << i)) ^ (b >> (i-1))) % (10**9+7) for i in range(a.bit_length())
The base case is dp[0] = 0.
We can iterate over the bits of a from right to left, updating dp[i] based on the previous value and the current bit of a.
This plan considers all possible subproblems and can be efficiently computed by iterating over the bits of a.
