===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we can't store the intermediate results for all indices i because they exceed the size limit, we need to use a more space-efficient approach.

Let dp[i] denote the sum of OR operations up to index i. Define dp[0] as 0 (base case).

dp[i] = dp[i-1] + ((a >> i) | (b << (i+1))) % (10**9+7)

To avoid recalculating subproblems, we can use a rolling hash approach:

dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (b & 1) if i is odd else dp[i-1]
where b & 1 gives the least significant bit of b.

Dynamic programming with bottom-up approach: initialize an empty list, fill it up from 0 to 314159 using the recurrence relation, and then sum up all values in the list. But this will still exceed the size limit.

Instead, we can use a single variable to keep track of the cumulative sum:

let cum_sum = 0
for i from 0 to 314159:
    cum_sum = (cum_sum + ((a >> i) | (b << (i+1)))) % (10**9+7)
print(cum_sum)
