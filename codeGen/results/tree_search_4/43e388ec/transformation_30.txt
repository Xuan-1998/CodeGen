===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure arises because the sum modulo 10^9+7 can be computed by adding the results of smaller subproblems.

State: 
dp[i][0] represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 for all values of i from 0 to a - 1, considering the current bit of a is 0.
dp[i][1] represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 for all values of i from 0 to a - 1, considering the current bit of a is 1.

Create a 2D array dp where 
dp[i][j] represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 for all values of i from 0 to a - 1 and j from 0 to b - 1, considering the current bit of a is j.
dp[i][j] can be computed as follows:
- If the current bit of a is the same as j, then dp[i][j] = (a^(i+1)) + dp[i-1][j]
- Otherwise, dp[i][j] = (b^(i+1)) + dp[i-1][j]

For each i from 0 to a - 1 and j from 0 to b - 1:
  If the current bit of a is the same as j, then 
    if i == 0: 
      return (a^((b+1)))
    else: 
      return ((dp[i-1][j] + (a^(i+1))) % (10^9 + 7))
  Else:
    if i == 0:
      return (b^((a+1)))
    else:
      return ((dp[i-1][j] + (b^(i+1))) % (10^9 + 7))

Return dp[a-1][b-1]
