===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure arises because the sum modulo 10^9+7 can be computed by adding the results of smaller subproblems.

The state expression is dp[i][j], where j is the j-th bit of b. The value of dp[i][j] is the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the (i+j)-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a - 1.

Consider the dynamic programming approach where dp[i][j] is the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the (i+j)-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a - 1. Then, the state transition relation is:

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + a[i]^b[(i+j)%b]

Tabulate using a 2D array where dp[i][j] is the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the (i+j)-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a - 1.

Let's iterate over each bit of a. For each bit, we compute the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on that bit and the corresponding bits of b.

We then sum up these sums modulo 10^9+7 for all bits to get the final answer.

This plan is correct in terms of identifying the optimal substructure and proposing a dynamic programming approach. However, it can be improved by further analyzing the state transition relation. For instance, we can observe that dp[i][j] only depends on dp[i-1][j] and not on any other values. This allows us to reduce the time complexity of our solution.

The potential issues with this plan are that it does not specify how to handle edge cases or deal with large input sizes. It also does not provide a clear implementation plan.

To improve the plan, we can add more details about how to handle edge cases and optimize the solution for large input sizes.
