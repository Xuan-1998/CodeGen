===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider defining dp[i] as the sum of OR operations for all j from 0 to i-1, and base case is dp[0] = 0.

dp[i] is the sum of OR operations for all j from 0 to i, considering the base case dp[0] = 0

Since the problem only requires us to calculate the result modulo 10^9+7, we can simplify the calculation by only keeping track of the total number of bits that are different between a and b. We can do this because for each OR operation, if the corresponding bit in a and b is the same, it won't contribute to the sum.

Initialize an array dp with size 315160 (to handle i from 0 to 314159) and set all elements to -1.

For each i from 1 to 314159:
    If i is not a power of 2, update dp[i] as dp[i-1] + (a^i | b^i)
    Else, update dp[i] as dp[i//2] if the ith bit in a and b are different
    Update dp[i] modulo 10^9+7

The final answer is dp[314159]
