===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation can be used since we need to calculate a cumulative sum and memoization might not be efficient here.

The state can be defined as DP[i] = (DP[i-1] ^ (b >> i%31)) % (10**9 + 7), with base case being DP[0] = a ^ b.

Consider a bit mask for each number. Initialize an array with zeros and update it by performing OR operation on the previous result and current bit of b. The final answer is the sum of all values in this array.

Implement memoization by creating a dictionary to store intermediate results, but instead of directly using the state as the key, consider the modulus operation (10**9 + 7) while updating the state. This is because we are working with large numbers and the direct calculation might cause an overflow error.

Store the base case DP[0] = a ^ b in the dictionary for memoization.

Iterate from i=1 to 314159, update the state DP[i] using the stored value DP[i-1], current bit of b, and modulus operation. Store the updated state in the dictionary for future reference.

Finally, calculate the sum of all values in the array, which gives us the required result modulo (10**9 + 7).
