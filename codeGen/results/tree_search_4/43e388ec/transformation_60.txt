===BEGIN PLAN===
The state can be defined as DP[i] = (DP[i-1] ^ (b >> i%31)) % (10**9 + 7), with base case being DP[0] = a ^ b.

Update DP[i] as the cumulative sum of OR(a, b << i) for all values of i from 0 to i, considering the modular addition and subtraction.

The plan is correct in its approach. To improve it, you can consider using a more efficient way to calculate the binary shift to the left operation on b, such as using the bitwise left shift operator (<<).

One potential issue with the plan is that it does not handle the case where i exceeds the maximum value for which the operation b >> i is defined. You should add checks to ensure that i is within the valid range.

The plan does include edge cases. It correctly handles the base case DP[0] = a ^ b and updates DP[i] as the cumulative sum of OR(a, b << i) for all values of i from 0 to i.
