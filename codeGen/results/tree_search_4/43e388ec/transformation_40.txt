===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure arises because the sum modulo 10^9+7 can be computed by adding the results of smaller subproblems.

The state expression is dp[i], where dp[i] represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the binary shift to the left operation on the (i-1)-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a.bit_length() - 1, considering the current bit of a.

dp[i] is the sum modulo 10^9+7 of dp[i-1] and the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the binary shift to the left operation on the (i-1)-th bit of b.

dp[0] = ((a & 1) ^ (b >> (b.bit_length() - 1))) % (10**9 + 7);

for i from 1 to a.bit_length() - 1:
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + ((a >> i) ^ (b << (a.bit_length() - i - 1))) % (10**9 + 7);

sum = 0;
for i from 0 to a.bit_length() - 1:
    sum = (sum + dp[i]) % (10**9 + 7);
