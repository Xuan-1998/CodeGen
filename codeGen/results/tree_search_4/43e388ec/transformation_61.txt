===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use dynamic programming with tabulation. The state can be defined as DP[i] = (DP[i-1] ^ (b >> i%31)) % (10**9 + 7), with base case being DP[0] = a ^ b.
Instead of calculating the cumulative sum for all values of i from 0 to i, we can calculate the difference between the current and previous sums. This will help us avoid redundant calculations.
We'll also need to consider edge cases where i is less than 0 or greater than 314159.
The final plan would be:
