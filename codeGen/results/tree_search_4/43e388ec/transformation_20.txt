===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i] represents the sum of OR operations for all j from 0 to i-1.

Base case: dp[0] = 0, as there are no OR operations to perform for i=0.

Create a dictionary dp where keys are values of i and values are lists containing the cumulative sums of OR operations for all j up to that value. Specifically:

dp[i] = [0] for i = 0
dp[1] = [(a ^ (b << 0))]
for i from 2 to 314159:
    dp[i] = dp[i-1] + [(a ^ (b << (i-1)))]
This plan accounts for the fact that subproblems can be overlapping, as mentioned in the problem statement.

The cumulative sums are stored in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations and reduce time complexity.
