===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem requires calculating OR operation for all values of i from 0 to 314159, a natural idea is that subproblems can be overlapping. For example, the result for i=10 can be used in the calculation for i=11.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i] = (dp[i-1] if i>0) ^ (b << (i-1)), where ^ denotes bitwise XOR and << denotes left shift.

dp[i] might represent the sum of OR operations performed for all values of j up to i, with transitions based on the values of a and b at each step. 

Utilize a dictionary-based memoization approach to store and retrieve the previously calculated values of dp[i].

For edge cases, consider handling when i is 0 or negative.

In addition to memoization, consider using bitwise operations to optimize calculations.

To avoid redundant calculations, initialize dp[0] = 0 (since there are no previous OR operations).

Consider a dynamic programming table size of at least 315160, which covers all values of i from 0 to 314159.
