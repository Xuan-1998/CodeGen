===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i] denotes the sum of OR operations up to index i, and define dp[0] as 0 (base case).
Let's use a dictionary for memoization: 
dp_dict = {0: 0}
for i in range(1, 314160):
    if i - 1 not in dp_dict:
        dp_dict[i-1] = ((a >> (i-1)) | (b << i)) % (10**9+7)
    dp[i] = dp_dict[i-1]
memoized_dp_sum = sum(dp[i] for i in range(314159))
