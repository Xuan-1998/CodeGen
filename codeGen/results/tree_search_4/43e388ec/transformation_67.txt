===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation could be an option since we need to calculate a cumulative sum and memoization might not be efficient here.

Let's define the state as DP[i] = (a & (1 << i)) ? (a - (1 << i) + b) : a, and base case is DP[0] = a.

State transition: For i > 0, if the ith bit of a is set, then DP[i] should be updated to (DP[i-1] - (1 << i) + b) % mod. If the ith bit of a is not set, then DP[i] remains the same as DP[i-1].

Base case: DP[0] = a.

Bit manipulation: Use bitwise operations to directly calculate the cumulative sum, avoiding the need for explicit iteration.

Final answer: The final answer would be the value of DP[314159] modulo 10^9 + 7.
