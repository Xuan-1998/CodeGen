===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure arises because the sum modulo 10^9+7 can be computed by adding the results of smaller subproblems.

The state expression is dp[i], where dp[i] represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the binary shift to the left operation on the (i-1)-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a - 1, considering the current bit of a.

dp[i] is the sum modulo 10^9+7 of dp[i-1] and the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the binary shift to the left operation on the (i-1)-th bit of b.

memo = {};
def solve(i):
    if i < 0:
        return 0;
    if memo.get(i, None):
        return memo[i];
    result = ...;
    memo[i] = result;
    return result;

for i in range(a.length):
    dp[i] = solve(i);

result = 0;
for i in range(a.length):
    result += dp[i];

print(result % (10^9+7));
