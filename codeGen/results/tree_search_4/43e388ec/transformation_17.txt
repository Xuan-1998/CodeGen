===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem requires calculating OR operation for all values of i from 0 to 314159, a natural idea is that subproblems can be overlapping. For example, the result for i=10 can be used in the calculation for i=11.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i] = (a ^ (b << i)) | (dp[i-1] if i > 0), where ^ denotes bitwise XOR and << denotes left shift.
dp[i] could signify the result of performing the OR operation between the result of the previous iteration and the result of the current iteration.

Initialize a list dp of size 315160, set all elements to 0. Then for each i in the range [1, 314159], calculate dp[i] as (a ^ (b << i)) | (dp[i-1]) if i > 0.
Finally, return dp[314159].
