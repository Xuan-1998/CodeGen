Tabulation could be an option since we need to calculate a cumulative sum and memoization might not be efficient here.

Let's define the state as DP[i] = (a & (1 << i)) ? (a - (1 << i) + b) : a, and base case is DP[0] = a.
Formulate state and transition relationships using bitwise operations: 
DP[i] = (a & (1 << i)) ? (DP[i-1] ^ (b >> i)) : DP[i-1].

To avoid calculating the same value multiple times, we can iterate from i to 314159:
for(int i = 0; i <= 314159; i++) {
    if(i == 0)
        DP[i] = a;
    else 
        DP[i] = (a & (1 << i)) ? (DP[i-1] ^ (b >> i)) : DP[i-1];
}
