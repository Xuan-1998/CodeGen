===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure arises because the sum modulo 10^9+7 can be computed by adding the results of smaller subproblems.

The state expression is dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the binary shift to the left operation on the j-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a - 1 and j from 0 to b - 1.

dp[i][j] is the sum modulo 10^9+7 of dp[i-1][j-1] and either the i-th bit of a or the (j-1)-th bit of b, considering the current bits of a and b. The state transitions depend on whether the i-th bit of a is 0 or 1.

The base case is when i = 0, where dp[0][j] represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on 0 (since there are no bits left) and the binary shift to the left operation on the j-th bit of b. This value can be precomputed for all values of j.

The plan includes edge cases, such as handling a = 0 or b = 0 separately, since these special cases would have different base cases.
