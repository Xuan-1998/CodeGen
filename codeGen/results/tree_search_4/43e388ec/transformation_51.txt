===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation could be an option since we need to calculate a cumulative sum and memoization might not be efficient here.

DP[i] = (a ^ (b << i)) % (10**9 + 7), where DP[0] = a ^ b and base case is DP[0].
DP[i] = (DP[i-1] + (a ^ (b << i))) % (10**9 + 7), where DP[0] = a ^ b.

For memoization, we can create a map to store the intermediate results.
Memoize the function that calculates the cumulative sum by storing the results of subproblems.

DP[i] = min(DP[i-1], (a ^ (b << i)) % (10**9 + 7)), where DP[0] = a ^ b and base case is DP[0].

To avoid overflow, we can calculate the result modulo 10^9+7 at each step.

The plan includes edge cases as it starts from the initial value of DP[0].
