To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with tabulation. The state DP[i] represents the cumulative sum modulo (10^9 + 7) after performing XOR operation on a and left shift of b for i times.

The base case is DP[0] = a ^ b, which initializes the first value in the DP array.

For each subsequent value, we can calculate it using the previous value and the current bit of b. This is because the XOR operation and left shift operation are associative and commutative, so we can break down the calculation into smaller parts.

The final answer is the sum of all values in the DP array.

Here's the updated plan:
