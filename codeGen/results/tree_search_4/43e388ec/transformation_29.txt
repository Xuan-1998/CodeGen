===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure arises because the sum modulo 10^9+7 can be computed by adding the results of smaller subproblems.

State: 
dp[i][0] represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 for all values of i from 0 to a - 1, considering the current bit of a is 0.
dp[i][1] represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 for all values of i from 0 to a - 1, considering the current bit of a is 1.

dp[i][b] represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 for all values of i from 0 to min(a, b) - 1, considering the current bits of a and b are b.

Implement tabulation using a dynamic programming table where each cell represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 for all values of i from 0 to min(a, b) - 1, considering the current bits of a and b.
For each cell dp[i][b], calculate the result by adding the results of smaller subproblems: 
dp[i][0] + (a - 2^i + 1) if b is 0
dp[i-1][1] + (a - 2^(i-1)) if b is 1

Finally, return dp[a][b] as the answer.
