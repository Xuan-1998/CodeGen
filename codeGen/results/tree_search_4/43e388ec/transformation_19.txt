===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i] represents the sum of OR operations for all j from 0 to i-1.
For each i, calculate dp[i] as the sum of OR operations between a and b shifted left by j for all j from 0 to i-1.

Base case: dp[0] = 0
Since there are no previous values to consider when i is 0.

dp[i] = OR(a, (b << i)) + OR(a, (b << (i - 1))) + ... + OR(a, b)
This sum calculates the total result of performing XOR operation on a and left shift operations on b for all j from 0 to i-1.
Memoization can be used to avoid redundant calculations.

dp[i] = dp[i-1] + OR(a, (b << i))
This formula avoids calculating the same subproblems multiple times by reusing previous results.

Since we are considering a and b as positive integers in binary representation, we need to handle edge cases where a or b has leading zeros.
To do this, convert both numbers into decimal first and then perform operations.
