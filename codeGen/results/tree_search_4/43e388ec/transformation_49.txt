===BEGIN PLAN===
DP[i] = (a ^ (b << i)) % (10**9 + 7), where DP[0] = a ^ b and base case is DP[0].
DP[i] = DP[i-1] + (a ^ (b << i)) % (10**9 + 7), where DP[0] = a ^ b.
Use memoization to store the intermediate results.
For edge cases, check if a or b is less than or equal to 0 and handle accordingly.
