The optimal substructure arises because the sum modulo 10^9+7 can be computed by adding the results of smaller subproblems.

State: dp[i][j] represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 for all values of i from 0 to a - 1 and j from 0 to b - 1, considering the current bits of a and b. The state transitions are as follows:
- If the current bit of a is 0, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
- If the current bit of a is 1, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + (dp[i-1][j-1] if j > 0 else 0) mod 10^9+7
- dp[0][j] = 0 for all j

Use memoization by defining a dictionary dp that maps each possible state (i, j) to its corresponding value.

Initialization: Fill the base cases of the dynamic programming table. Since the problem statement guarantees that a and b are positive integers in binary representation and do not contain leading zeros, we can initialize the first row and column with 0.

Transition: For every cell dp[i][j], compute its value based on the previous cells and the current bits of a and b. Update the memoization dictionary accordingly.

Final Answer: The answer is dp[a-1][b-1] mod 10^9+7.
