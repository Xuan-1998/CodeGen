===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure arises because the sum modulo 10^9+7 can be computed by adding the results of smaller subproblems.
The state expression is dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the binary shift to the left operation on the j-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a - 1, considering the current bits of a and b.
dp[i][j] is the sum modulo 10^9+7 of dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], or 0, depending on the values of i-th bit of a and j-th bit of b.
A tabulation approach could be used by initializing a 2D array with zeros, then filling it up according to the state expression and using the precomputed values to compute the final result. 
The base case is when i or j is 0, in which case dp[i][j] is either 0 if both bits are 0, or 1 if at least one bit is 1.
Finally, the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the results for all values of i from 0 to a - 1 and j from 0 to b - 1 can be computed by adding up the precomputed values in dp[][].
