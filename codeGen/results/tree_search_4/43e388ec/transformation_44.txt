The optimal substructure arises because the sum modulo 10^9+7 can be computed by adding the results of smaller subproblems. The state expression is dp[i], where dp[i] represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the binary shift to the left operation on the (i-1)-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a - 1, considering the current bit of a.

dp[i] is calculated as dp[i-1] + ((a >> i) ^ (b >> (i-1))) % (10^9+7), where (a >> i) is the binary shift to the left operation on the i-th bit of a and (b >> (i-1)) is the binary shift to the left operation on the (i-1)-th bit of b. The result is considered modulo 10^9+7.

Consider implementing a memoization function that utilizes a dictionary to store and retrieve previously computed values, allowing for efficient lookups. This approach avoids redundant computation by storing and reusing previously calculated dp[i] values.

The base case would be when i = 0, where dp[0] is the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the most significant bit of a and the most significant bit of b. This can be initialized to 0 or some other suitable value.
