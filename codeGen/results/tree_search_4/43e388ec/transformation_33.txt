The optimal substructure arises because the sum modulo 10^9+7 can be computed by adding the results of smaller subproblems.
The state expression is dp[i][j], where j is the j-th bit of b. The value of dp[i][j] is the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the (i+j)-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a - 1.
Let dp[i][j] be the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the (i+j)-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a - 1. Then, the state transition relation is dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][(j+1)%b] + a[i]^b[(i+j)%b].
Use dynamic programming with two nested loops to create a 2D table, where each cell represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the (i+j)-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a - 1.
The base case is dp[0][j] = 0, since there are no bits left in a.
For the problem size constraint of a < 2^10^5, it's efficient enough to use an array of size 2*10^5 for each dimension of the 2D table.
Calculate and print the sum modulo 10^9+7 of all dp[i][j] values from 0 to b - 1.
