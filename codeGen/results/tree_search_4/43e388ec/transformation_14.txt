===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can define a one-dimensional DP array dp of size 314160 (since we need to calculate for i up to 314159 and also include the base case of i=0) initialized with zeros.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i] = a ^ (b << i), where ^ denotes bitwise XOR and << denotes left shift. This represents the sum of OR operations performed for all values of j up to i, with transitions based on the values of a and b at each step.

We initialize dp[0] = a, since there is no need to perform any shifts when i=0.

For each i from 1 to 314159, we calculate dp[i] as follows:

dp[i] = (a ^ b) + dp[i-1]

This is because the OR operation for i can be calculated by performing the OR operation on a and the left-shifted version of b (b << i), and adding this to the cumulative sum calculated so far.

Finally, we return dp[314159] % (10^9+7) as our answer.
