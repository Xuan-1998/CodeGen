===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can define a 2D DP table dp[i][j] where i represents the value from 0 to 314159 and j represents the bits in binary representation. 

Initially, all values in dp are set to 0.

For each bit j from 0 to 9 (since the maximum value is less than 2^10), we calculate dp[i][j] as follows:
- If i < 2^j, then dp[i][j] = a ^ (b << i)
- Else, dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + a ^ (b >> (9-j))) % (10^9+7)

The final answer is the sum of all values in dp[314159].

This plan takes care of edge cases as it correctly handles the case when i is less than 2^j. It also uses a modulo operation to ensure that the result remains within the range.
