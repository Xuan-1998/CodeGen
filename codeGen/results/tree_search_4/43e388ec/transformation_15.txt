===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using Dynamic Programming, we can define the state expression as follows:

dp[i] = dp[i-1] ^ (b << 1)

This means that for each value of i from 0 to 314159, we calculate the XOR operation between the result from the previous iteration and the left shifted version of b. This way, we avoid recalculating the same values multiple times.

We can create a DP array dp where dp[i] represents the result of performing the XOR operation between a and the left shifted version of b for all i.

The base case is dp[0] = a ^ b, since this is the initial value when i=0.

To handle edge cases, we need to make sure that our plan works correctly even when i=0. This means we should initialize dp[0] = a ^ b and then use this value as the starting point for calculating subsequent values of dp[i].

The time complexity of this approach would be O(10^5) since we are iterating from 0 to 314159, which is dominated by the number of iterations. The space complexity would be O(1) since we only need a single variable to store the current value.
