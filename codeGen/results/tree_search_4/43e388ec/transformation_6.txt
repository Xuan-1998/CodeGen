===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i] denote the sum of OR operations up to index i, and define dp[0] as 0 (base case).
State: dp[i], Transition:
dp[i] = dp[i-1] + ((a ^ ((b << i))) % (10**9+7))
The key insight here is that we can use the previous result to calculate the next one, which makes the problem suitable for dynamic programming.
Let's consider two adjacent values of i: i and i-1. The OR operation for i involves a term for b shifted left by i bits, whereas the OR operation for i-1 only considers shifts up to i-1 bits. Therefore, we can reuse the result for i-1 when calculating dp[i], which reduces the problem size.
This plan correctly captures the overlapping subproblems and can be optimized further by precomputing powers of 2.
