The optimal substructure arises because the sum modulo 10^9+7 can be computed by adding the results of smaller subproblems.

The state expression is dp[i][j], where j is the j-th bit of b. The value of dp[i][j] is the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the (i+j)-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a - 1.

Let dp[i][j] be the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the (i+j)-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a - 1. Then, the state transition relation is dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][(j+1)%b] + a[i]) ^ b[(i+j)%b].

Use dynamic programming with two nested loops and a state transition relation to fill up a 2D table, where each cell represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on the i-th bit of a and the (i+j)-th bit of b for all values of i from 0 to a - 1.

Let dp[0][j] = a[j] for all j. Then, for each i from 1 to |a|, compute dp[i][j] using the state transition relation.

The final answer is the sum of all entries in the bottom row of the table modulo 10^9+7.
