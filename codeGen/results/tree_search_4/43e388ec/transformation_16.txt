===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem requires calculating OR operation for all values of i from 0 to 314159, we can divide this range into chunks and calculate each chunk separately.

The state expression remains as dp[i] = a ^ (b << i), where ^ denotes bitwise XOR and << denotes left shift. dp[i] could signify the result of performing the XOR operation between a and the left shifted version of b, repeated for all values of j from 0 to i.

We will use a dictionary as memoization table where the key is the current state and the value is the computed result.

For each chunk, we calculate the first value dp[i], then use this value to calculate the next value dp[i+1]. This way, we avoid calculating the same subproblem multiple times.

To further optimize the calculation, we can separate the calculation into two parts: one for even i and one for odd i. For even i, the left shift of b is equivalent to the original b, so the calculation reduces to a ^ (b ^ b). For odd i, the left shift of b is equivalent to the original b with its least significant bit set to 1.

This way, we reduce the number of operations needed and make the problem more tractable.
