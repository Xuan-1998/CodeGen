===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation could be an option since we need to calculate a cumulative sum and memoization might not be efficient here.

The state can be defined as DP[i] = (DP[i-1] ^ (b >> i % 31)) % (10**9 + 7), with base case being DP[0] = a ^ b.

However, there's no need to calculate each cumulative sum separately. We can directly calculate the cumulative sum modulo (10^9 + 7) after performing XOR operation on a and left shift of b for i times, starting from initial values as a ^ b.

The plan remains mostly correct, but it could be improved by avoiding unnecessary calculations. Initialize an array DP with zeros and update it by performing OR operation on the previous result and current bit of b.

The final answer is the sum of all values in this array.
