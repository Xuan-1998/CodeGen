===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem requires calculating OR operation for all values of i from 0 to 314159, a natural idea is that subproblems can be overlapping. For example, the result for i=10 can be used in the calculation for i=11.

Consider defining dp[i] as the sum of OR operations for all j from 0 to i-1, and base case is dp[0] = 0.

dp[i] represents the result of performing XOR operation on a and the binary shift to the left operation on b for all values j from 0 to i-1

Use a dynamic programming table with indices ranging from 0 to 314159 to store the cumulative sums of OR operations.

For each i, calculate dp[i] as the sum of (a ^ (b << i)) and the previously calculated dp[i-1]

Update the dynamic programming table by storing the calculated value of dp[i]

The base case is dp[0] = 0

The final answer is dp[314159] modulo 10^9+7
