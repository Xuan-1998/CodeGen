===BEGIN PLAN===
Maintain a binary string where '1' represents a win and '0' represents a loss.

// Initialize a memoization array dp[n][2^n] with False values

for phase from 0 to n:
    for i from 0 to 2^n - 1:
        if s[phase] == '1':
            // If the team wins, update dp[phase][i] with True
            dp[phase][i] = True
        else:
            // If the team loses, update dp[phase][i] with False
            dp[phase][i] = False

    for i from 0 to 2^n - 1:
        if dp[phase][i]:
            // Check if any team has won at least one game in each phase
            result.add(i)

// Print the winning teams
print(result)
