===BEGIN PLAN===
Maintain a binary string where '1' represents a win and '0' represents a loss. Use memoization to store the winning teams for each prefix of the string.

State: For each prefix of the string from 0 to i, keep track of the winning teams in a set or list.
Transition relationship: If the current bit is '1', add the team that wins this game to the set if it's not already there. The number of ways for a team to win is equal to the sum of the ways they can win if they lose this game and the ways they can win if they win this game.

Use dynamic programming by initializing a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways the j-th team can win up to i phases, then update the array based on whether the current bit is '1' or '0'.

Base case: For each team j and phase i = n, the winning teams are all the teams that have won at least one game.

Transition relationship: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][k] for all k such that s[i-1][k] == '1' if i > 0

Find the winning teams by iterating through the array and checking which team has won at least one game in each phase.
