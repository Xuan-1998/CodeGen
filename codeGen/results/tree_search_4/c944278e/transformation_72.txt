===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the tournament into smaller phases, and use dynamic programming to find all possible winning teams for each phase. Then combine the results from each phase to get the final list of winning teams.

A state represents the skill levels of all teams that have not been eliminated yet, and the base case is when only one team remains.

The state is the current phase, and the transition function decides which teams are eliminated or advance to the next phase.

Implement a recursive function with memoization to store intermediate results for each team combination and phase.

For each phase:
    1. Initialize an empty list to store winning teams
    2. For each possible combination of teams in the current phase:
        a. Check if any team has a skill level that is not less than all other teams (i.e., it can win)
        b. If yes, add this team combination to the list of winning teams and mark them as eliminated for the next phase
    3. Sort the list of winning teams in ascending order

Combine results from each phase:
    1. Initialize an empty set to store all winning teams
    2. For each phase:
        a. Add all winning teams from that phase to the set
    3. Return the sorted set of winning teams

This plan correctly solves the problem by recursively generating and storing intermediate results, which can then be combined to find the final list of winning teams.

The only potential issue is dealing with edge cases where some teams are eliminated early in the tournament, but this can be handled by initializing the memoization table with an empty set for each phase.

The plan does include edge cases such as when all teams have been eliminated except one, which would still be considered a winning team.
