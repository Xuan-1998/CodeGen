Plan:

Divide the tournament into smaller phases.

Each phase represents all possible matches that have been played in that phase. This can be represented by a binary string where 0 denotes a loss and 1 denotes a win.

Use dynamic programming to find all possible winning teams for each phase.

A state represents the skill levels of all teams that have not been eliminated yet, and the base case is when only one team remains.

Use a set to keep track of all possible states in the tournament, and use this set to memoize the number of winning teams for each state.

For each team, calculate its win/loss ratio from the previous phases. This will give you an idea about how well the team is performing.

Sort the teams based on their win/loss ratios in descending order. The teams with higher ratios are more likely to be winners in future matches.

Return all the winning teams that have not been eliminated yet, and are still in the competition.

The time complexity of this plan will be O(2^n), where n is the number of phases. This is because you have 2 choices for each phase: either a team wins or loses.

The space complexity will also be O(2^n) to store all possible states.
