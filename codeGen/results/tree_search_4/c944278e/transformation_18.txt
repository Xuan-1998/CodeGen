===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider teams that have won at least one game in each phase of the tournament. 
Use dynamic programming to find all such teams. Memoize the results for faster computation.

A state expression could be dp[i][j] = True if team j can win from the i-th phase onwards;

Create a 2D array, dp, of size n+1 x (2^n + 1), where dp[i][j] represents whether team j can win from the i-th phase onwards.

For each i and j:
    If s[i-1] is '1', then set dp[i][j] to True if and only if there exists a k such that:
        - dp[i-1][k] is True
        - team k loses to team j in the current phase

The final result would be all teams j such that dp[n][j] is True.

This plan correctly captures the essence of the problem. However, it can be improved by reducing the state space and eliminating unnecessary computations. For example:
    Initialize dp[0][j] = False for all j
    For each i from 1 to n:
        For each k from 0 to (2^i - 1):
            Set dp[i][k | (1 << i)] to True if there exists a team l such that:
                dp[i-1][l] is True and team l loses to team k in the current phase
    Return all j such that dp[n][j] is True

This improved plan reduces the state space from 2^n x (2^n + 1) to (2^n - 1) x 1, making it more efficient.
