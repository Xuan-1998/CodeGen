===BEGIN PLAN===
Maintain a binary string where '1' represents a win and '0' represents a loss. 
Use memoization to store the winning teams for each prefix of the string.
For each phase, iterate through the binary string from left to right.
If the current team has won at least one game in that phase, add it to the memoization array.
After processing all phases, find all the teams that have won at least one game in each phase and return them as the winning teams.

===END PLAN===
