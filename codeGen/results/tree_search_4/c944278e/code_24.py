===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider teams that have won at least one game in each phase of the tournament, and use dynamic programming to find all such teams.
The initial state expression could be dp[i][j] = True if team j has won at least one game up to the i-th phase. This can be easily computed by iterating over the binary string s and checking if the ith bit is 1 (meaning team j won in that phase).
To improve the plan, we can consider a more complex state expression dp[i][j] = True if team j has won at least one game up to the i-th phase. This can be computed by iterating over all possible skill levels of teams and seeing which ones can still win given their past performances.
The winning condition is that any team with skill level greater than or equal to its opponent can win. This means that for each phase, we need to check all possible skill levels of teams and see which ones can still win given their past performances.

Here's the Python code implementing your intuition:
