===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the tournament into smaller phases, and use dynamic programming to find all possible winning teams for each phase. Then combine the results from each phase to get the final list of winning teams.

The state expression is the current number of winning teams found so far, and the base case is when there are no more teams to consider, in which case the current set of winning teams is the final answer.

The state can be represented as a binary string where each bit corresponds to whether a team has won or lost in that phase. This will help us to easily generate all possible combinations of winning teams for each phase.

Memoization using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems, where the key is the current state of the tournament and the value is the list of winning teams for that state. This will prevent us from recomputing the same subproblem multiple times.

To improve the plan, we can sort the possible combinations of winning teams in ascending order before adding them to the dictionary. This will ensure that all the results are stored in a consistent manner and make it easier to retrieve the results when needed.

One potential issue with the plan is handling edge cases. For example, what if there are no winning teams in some phase? We should add a check to handle such cases.

Another issue is how to correctly combine the results from each phase to get the final list of winning teams. We should make sure that we are not including any team more than once in the final answer.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
