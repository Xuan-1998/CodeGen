===BEGIN PLAN===
Maintain a boolean array where dp[i][j] represents whether team j is still in the competition after i phases.

Transition from dp[i-1][j] to dp[i][j] based on s[i]. If s[i] = 1, then the winner of this phase remains in the competition.
If s[i] = 0 and dp[i-1][j] is True, team j loses but can still participate if they won at least one game before.

Maintain a set of winning teams. Iterate through each team i. If dp[n-1][i] is True, add team i to the set of winning teams.
The time complexity would be O(n * 2^n) and space complexity would be O(2^n), as we need to store the dynamic programming table.

The base case would be when n = 1, where all teams are considered winning teams.
For larger values of n, maintain a recursive function with memoization. The function should take two parameters: the current phase i, and the current team j.
If the result for the current subproblem is already in the memo dictionary, return the stored value. Otherwise, calculate the result based on s[i] and dp[i-1][j], then store it in the memo dictionary.

The main function would iterate through each possible team, call the recursive function with n = 0 and j = 0 as parameters, and add the winning teams to a set.
Finally, sort the set of winning teams in ascending order and print the result.
