===BEGIN PLAN===
Maintain a binary string where '1' represents a win and '0' represents a loss.

dp[i]: For each prefix of the string from 0 to i, keep track of the winning teams in a set or list. 
State: The state is the prefix of the string from 0 to i.
Transition relationship: If the current bit is '1', add the team that wins this game to the set if it's not already there. 
Memoize a dictionary where keys are prefixes of the binary string and values are sets of winning teams.

base case: dp[n] represents all winning teams in the tournament.

Initialize dp[0] with an empty set since no games have been played yet.
For i from 1 to n:
    if s[i-1] == '1':
        Add the team that wins this game to dp[i-1] if it's not already there.
    else:
        Update dp[i] as a copy of dp[i-1].
Memoize dp for future reference.

Find all winning teams by checking if any team has won at least one game in each phase. 
Check each team and see if it has won at least once. If yes, add the team to the set of winning teams.
Sort the set of winning teams in ascending order.
