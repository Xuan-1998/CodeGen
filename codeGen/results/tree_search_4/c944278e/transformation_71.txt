===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the tournament into smaller phases, and use dynamic programming to find all possible winning teams for each phase. Then combine the results from each phase to get the final list of winning teams.

A state represents the skill levels of all teams that have not been eliminated yet, and the base case is when only one team remains.

The state is the current phase, and the transition function decides which teams are eliminated or advance to the next phase. The dynamic programming array will store the set of winning teams for each phase.

The initial condition is a 2D array with dimensions (n+1) x 2^n, where n is the number of phases in the tournament. Initialize all elements to an empty set.

For each phase i from 0 to n-1:
    For each possible team combination c in the current phase:
        If the teams in c have not been eliminated in the current phase:
            Compute the transition function for this state, which is the winning teams that can advance to the next phase.
            Update the dynamic programming array at position (i+1, c) with the result of the transition function.

The final answer will be the set of winning teams stored in the last row of the 2D array.

This plan correctly captures the essence of the problem and provides a clear direction for solving it. The dynamic programming approach is well-suited for this problem, as it allows us to break down the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

To improve the plan, we could consider optimizing the transition function or using a more efficient data structure to store the team combinations.

Potential issues with the plan include:
* Handling edge cases: What if there are no teams left in a phase? How do we handle this?
* Optimizing the dynamic programming array: Can we reduce the size of the array or use a more efficient data structure?

Edge cases that need to be considered:
* When n is 0, there is only one team and it can win the tournament.
* When n is 1, there are two teams and they compete in a single phase. The winning team is determined by their skill levels.

This plan does not include code, but rather provides a detailed outline of the approach to solving the problem.
