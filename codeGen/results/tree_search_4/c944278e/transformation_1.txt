===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider teams that have won at least one game in each phase of the tournament, and use dynamic programming to find all such teams. Memoize the results for faster computation.

State expression: dp[i][j] = True if team j can win from the i-th phase onwards; otherwise False.
dp[i][j] = (s[i] == '1' and any(s[k] == '1' for k in range(n) if s[k] == '1'))  # Corrected this line to include all teams that have won at least one game

Memoize the results using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems, and then look up the results for subproblems that have already been solved.

Sort the winning teams by their IDs.
