===BEGIN PLAN===
Maintain a dictionary dp where dp[(i, s)] represents the winning teams for the prefix s of length i.

1. Initialize dp as an empty dictionary.

2. Iterate through each phase i from 0 to n-1:
    * For each team j (where 0 <= j < 2^i), calculate its skill level by summing up the bits at positions i, i-1, ..., 0 in s.
    * If the calculated skill level is greater than or equal to the total number of teams that have won in the first i phases, consider team j as a potential winner.
    * Add all potential winners to dp[(i, s)].

3. Initialize an empty set winning_teams to store the final result.
4. Iterate through each phase i from 0 to n-1:
    * For each state (i, s) in dp:
        + If dp[(i, s)] is not empty, add all teams in dp[(i, s)] to winning_teams.

5. Return winning_teams as the final result.
