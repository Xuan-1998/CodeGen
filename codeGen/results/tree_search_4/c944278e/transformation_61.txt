===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the tournament into smaller phases, and use dynamic programming to find all possible winning teams for each phase. Then combine the results from each phase to get the final list of winning teams.

The state expression is a binary string where each bit corresponds to whether a team has won or lost in that phase, and the base case is when there are no more teams to consider, in which case the current set of winning teams is the final answer.

Tabulation using a 2D array to store the results of subproblems, where each index represents the current number of winning teams, the phase (0-indexed), and the value at that index is the list of winning teams for that number in that phase.

For each phase, iterate through all possible binary strings representing the winning teams, and for each string:
- Check if it corresponds to a valid set of winning teams based on the tournament results.
- If it does, update the 2D array with the list of winning teams and the current number of winning teams.

The final answer is the union of the lists of winning teams from all phases, in ascending order.
