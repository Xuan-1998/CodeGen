===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider teams that have won at least one game in each phase of the tournament, and use dynamic programming to find all such teams.

The base case is when n == 1, as there's only one winning team in a single-game tournament. Initialize dp[0][j] for j = 0...2^(n-1) with values representing the number of winning teams after 0 rounds, given that the current team wins j games in this round.

To define a transition function that updates the state based on whether the current team wins or loses its match. For each i from 1 to n and for each possible outcome of the current team's match (win/loss), update dp[i][j] using dp[i-1][k] where k is the number of winning teams when the current team won j games in the previous round.

Implement tabulation by creating a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of winning teams after i rounds, given that the current team wins j games in this round. Initialize all values to -1, except for the base case where n == 1.

For each possible skill level, iterate through all possible outcomes of the tournament and update dp[n-1][i] if the current team wins at least one game in each phase. Finally, return all indices i such that dp[n-1][i] is greater than or equal to 0.
