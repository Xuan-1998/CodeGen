===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] = True if team j can win from the i-th phase onwards; otherwise False.
Initialize dp as a dictionary with 0s, where key is the team index and value is a boolean array of length n+1.
For each i from n-1 down to 0:
    For each j from 0 to 2^n - 1:
        If s[i] == '1' and there exists k < i such that dp[k][j] and s[k] == '0', then set dp[i][j] = True.
Memoize the results using the dp dictionary.
Find all teams for which dp[n-1][j] is True. These are the winning teams.
Sort these teams in ascending order.
