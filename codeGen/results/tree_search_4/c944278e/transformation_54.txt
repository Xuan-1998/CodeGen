===BEGIN PLAN===
Maintain a 2D table dp where each cell [i][j] represents the set of teams that have won at least i games by the end of phase j.

State: The winning teams for the first k phases. Transition relationship:
For each phase i from 0 to n-1, update the state by considering all combinations of winning and losing outcomes in the next phase.
Let wi be the binary string representing the result of the i-th phase.
For each team t that has won at least i games so far (i.e., dp[i][j] contains t), 
if wi[t] is 1, then it means team t wins this game; if wi[t] is 0, then team t loses.
Update the state by adding teams to dp[i+1][j+1] that have won at least i+1 games in the new phase.

Base case: When i equals n, all teams that have won at least one game are considered winning teams.
State: The set of teams that have won at least one game.
Transition relationship: This is the base case; no more updates are needed.

Edge cases:
- If n is 0 or 1, there is only one possible outcome (win or loss), so we just consider all teams as winning or losing accordingly.
- If s is an empty string, return an empty set of winning teams.

The plan seems correct. It correctly captures the dynamic programming nature of the problem and uses a bottom-up approach to solve it.
However, note that the state transition relationship can be optimized by only considering teams that have won at least i games so far (i.e., dp[i][j]).
This is because a team cannot win more games than it has already won. This optimization will reduce the time complexity of the problem.
The edge cases are also correctly handled.
