===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the tournament into smaller phases, and use dynamic programming to find all possible winning teams for each phase. Then combine the results from each phase to get the final list of winning teams.

The state expression is the current number of winning teams found so far, and the base case is when there are no more teams to consider, in which case the current set of winning teams is the final answer.

Consider two cases: the current team wins, and it loses. In both cases:
  * If the current team wins, update the state by recursively calling the function with the updated state.
  * If the current team loses, update the state by recursively calling the function with the updated state.
Utilize tabulation by initializing a 2D table where the rows represent the phases and the columns represent the possible numbers of winning teams. Fill in the table using recursive calls, and finally return the last row as the solution.
