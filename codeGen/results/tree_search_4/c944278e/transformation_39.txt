===BEGIN PLAN===
Maintain a boolean array dp where dp[i][j] represents whether team j has won at least one game after i phases.

Base case: When input has only one phase, all teams that have won at least one game are considered winning teams. Initialize dp[0] as an array of False values, and then set dp[0][i] to True if the ith bit in the string is 1.

Transition from dp[i-1][k] to dp[i][j] based on k being equal to (s[i]^j). If s[i] = 1 and (s[i]^j) = 1, then the winner of this phase remains a winning team. Set dp[i][j] as follows:
    - If s[i-1] = 0, update dp[i][j] based on dp[i-1][k]. 
    - If s[i-1] = 1 and (s[i]^j) = 1, set dp[i][j] to True.

Use a dictionary dp_winners to store the winning teams for each prefix of the string. The key is the prefix, and the value is a set of winning teams.

Build dp_winners as follows:
    - Initialize dp_winners as an empty dictionary.
    - For i from 1 to n (inclusive), calculate all the winners after i phases using dp[i-1]. 
    - Update dp_winners with the winners for each prefix.

Finally, return the set of winning teams that appear in every prefix. This is done by finding the intersection of all sets in dp_winners.
