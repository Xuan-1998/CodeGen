===BEGIN PLAN===
Maintain a binary string where '1' represents a win and '0' represents a loss. 
Use memoization to store the winning teams for each prefix of the string.

Let the state be a tuple (i, s) where i is the current phase and s is the binary string from the 0th to the ith phase.
Represent each state as (i, s) and transition to the next state by appending one character from the input string,
checking if any team has won at least one game in each phase.

Memoize the states as a dictionary where the key is the tuple (i, s) 
and the value is a set of winning teams for that state.

For each state (i, s), find all the teams that have won at least one game in each phase by iterating over the binary string.
A team wins if it has '1' in each position where its corresponding skill level is greater than or equal to the opponent's skill level.

To find the winning teams, iterate over the states from the initial state (0, '') to the final state (n-1, s).
For each state, check if any team has won at least one game in each phase.
If yes, add these winning teams to the result set.

Finally, return the set of winning teams in ascending order.
