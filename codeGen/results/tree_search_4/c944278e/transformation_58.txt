===BEGIN PLAN===
Maintain a binary string where '1' represents a win and '0' represents a loss. 
Use memoization to store the winning teams for each prefix of the string 
and then find the winning teams by checking if any team has won at least one game in each phase.
The base case would be when i is equal to n, where all teams that have won at least one game are considered winning teams.

State: The skill levels of the teams as a binary string where '1' represents a win. 
Transition relationship: Update the state by iterating through the teams and checking if any team has won at least one game in each phase.
Maintain a dynamic programming table where dp[i] represents whether any team can win the tournament up to the i-th phase, 
and then iterate through the teams to find the winning ones.

For each team, check its skill level for the first n phases. If the team wins at least once in each phase, it is considered a winning team.
Sort the winning teams in ascending order.
