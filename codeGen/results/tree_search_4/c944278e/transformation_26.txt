===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider teams that have won at least one game in each phase of the tournament, and use dynamic programming to find all such teams. Memoize the results for faster computation.

The winning condition is that any team with skill level greater than or equal to its opponent can win.
A more complex state expression could be dp[i][j][k] = True if team j with skill level k can win from the i-th phase onwards;

Implement a bottom-up approach by initializing the dp table with base cases and then iteratively updating the table using previously computed values.

To improve this plan, consider iterating over the binary string in reverse order. This way, you start with the latest game results and work your way backward. This can simplify the logic for updating the dp table.

The plan seems to handle edge cases correctly, but it's essential to test the code thoroughly to ensure that it works for all possible inputs.
