===BEGIN PLAN===
Maintain a binary string where '1' represents a win and '0' represents a loss.
Initialize an empty set S to store the winning teams for each prefix of the string.

Transition from S to the next step by iterating through all elements in S, checking if they are still valid winners after considering the current phase. 
For each binary string t in S:
    Check if there exists another team that has won at least one game against t in the current phase.
    If not, then t is a winning team and add it to the result set.

Maintain memoization with a recursive function that checks if any team has won at least one game in each phase and returns the list of winning teams. 
For the base case when n == 1:
    All teams are considered winning teams.
Return the set of winning teams.
