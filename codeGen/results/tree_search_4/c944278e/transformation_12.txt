===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider teams that have won at least one game in each phase of the tournament, and use dynamic programming to find all such teams.

The base case is when n == 1, as there's only one winning team in a single-game tournament. For n > 1, define dp[i][j] as the number of winning teams after i rounds, given that the current team wins j games in this round.

Define a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where:

- Initialize dp[0][0] to the total number of possible teams (2^n) for the base case.
- For each phase i from 1 to n:
    - Iterate over all possible results j (from 0 to 2^i) in the current phase.
    - If team wins j games, update dp[i][j] as the sum of:
        - The number of winning teams that win j games in this round and lose the remaining i-1 rounds (dp[i-1][j]).
        - The number of winning teams that lose j games in this round but have already won enough matches to be considered winning teams in previous phases.
    - For each team, update its status based on whether it wins or loses the current match.

The final answer is all indices i such that dp[n-1][i] > 0, which represent the winning teams.
