Begin Plan:
Maintain a binary string where '1' represents a win and '0' represents a loss. 
Use memoization to store the winning teams for each prefix of the string 
and then find the winning teams by checking if any team has won at least one game in each phase.

Let the state be a tuple (i, s) where i is the current phase and s is the binary string from the 0th to the ith phase. 

Maintain a dynamic programming table dp[i][j] where 
dp[i][j] represents the winning teams for the first i phases when the jth bit is 1.

You can implement tabulation by initializing a dynamic programming table dp with size 2^n x n and filling it up using nested loops.
For each phase, check if any team has won at least one game. If yes, add that team to the set of winning teams.

Then, sort the set of winning teams in ascending order.

Finally, print out all the winning teams in ascending order.
