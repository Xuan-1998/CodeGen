===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the tournament into smaller phases, and use dynamic programming to find all possible winning teams for each phase. Then combine the results from each phase to get the final list of winning teams.

A state represents the skill levels of all teams that have not been eliminated yet, and the base case is when only one team remains.

1. Initialize a memoization table with dimensions 2^n x (the maximum possible skill level). Each cell will store the set of winning teams for each phase.
2. Iterate through each phase:
    - For each phase, initialize a current state as all teams remaining in the tournament.
    - Recursively calculate the sets of winning teams for both halves of the tournament.
    - Combine these results to get the winning teams for the current phase.
3. Memoize the result from step 2 and update it for the next phase.

This plan avoids redundant computations by using memoization, which improves its efficiency.
