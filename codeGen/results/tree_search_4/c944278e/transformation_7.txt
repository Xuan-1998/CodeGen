===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider teams that have won at least one game in each phase of the tournament, and use dynamic programming to find all such teams. Memoize the results for faster computation.

State expression: dp[i][j] = True if team j can win from the i-th phase onwards; otherwise False.
dp[i][j] = (s[i] == '1') or (i > 0 and any k < i such that s[k] == '1' and dp[k][j])

Use a dictionary to store the memoized results, with keys as tuples (i, j) and values as boolean indicating whether team j can win from phase i onwards.

State initialization: dp[0][j] = True for all j
