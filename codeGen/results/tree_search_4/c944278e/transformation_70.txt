===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the tournament into smaller phases, and use dynamic programming to find all possible winning teams for each phase. Then combine the results from each phase to get the final list of winning teams.

A state represents the skill levels of all teams that have not been eliminated yet, and the base case is when only one team remains.

Use a recursive function to calculate the number of winning teams for each phase, with memoization to store intermediate results and avoid recomputation. 

For each phase, iterate through all possible outcomes (win or lose) and update the state accordingly.
If a team wins in the current phase, add its skill level to the set of remaining teams; if it loses, remove its skill level from the set.
The base case is when there's only one team left, which is always a winning team.

To avoid duplicate calculations, use memoization to store the number of winning teams for each state and only calculate it once.
Combine the results from each phase to get the final list of winning teams in ascending order.
