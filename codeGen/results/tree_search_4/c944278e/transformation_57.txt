===BEGIN PLAN===
Maintain a binary string where '1' represents a win and '0' represents a loss.

The plan can be improved by defining a function that recursively checks if a team can win the tournament up to the current phase. This approach is known as memoization, which stores the results of expensive function calls and reuses them when the same inputs occur again.

The base case would be when i is equal to n, where all teams that have won at least one game are considered winning teams.

State: The skill levels of the teams as a binary string where '1' represents a win.
Transition relationship: Update the state by checking if any team has won at least one game in each phase.

Employ top-down memoization by defining a function that takes the current phase and team index as inputs, and recursively checks if the team can win the tournament up to the current phase.
