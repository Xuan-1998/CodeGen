===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider teams that have won at least one game in each phase of the tournament, and use dynamic programming to find all such teams.

Memoize the results for faster computation.

The base case is when n == 1, as there's only one winning team in a single-game tournament.

To view each phase of the tournament as a recursive decision: either the winning team advances to the next round or the losing team is eliminated.

Employ dynamic programming with a recursive function and update it accordingly. However, this approach might not be efficient for large values of n.

To improve the plan, consider using a bottom-up approach instead of a top-down one. This can reduce the number of recursive calls and make the solution more efficient.

The potential issue with the plan is that it might not handle edge cases correctly. For example, what if there are no winning teams? How would you handle this case?

To include edge cases, consider adding additional checks to the base case or updating the recursive function to handle these cases.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
