===BEGIN PLAN===
Maintain a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the winning teams for the first i phases, with j being the skill level of the team.
For each phase, update the DP state by considering the current phase's result and the previous phase's winning teams.
Use memoization to store the DP states and avoid redundant calculations.

Here are the step-by-step details:

1. Initialize dp[0][j] for all 0 <= j < 2^n with an empty set, indicating that no team has won any games in the first phase.

2. For each phase i = 1 to n:
   - Iterate over all teams j = 0 to 2^n-1.
   - If s[i-1] is '1', update dp[i][j] with the winning teams of the previous phase dp[i-1][j].
   - If s[i-1] is '0', update dp[i][j] with the losing teams of the previous phase dp[i-1][~j], where ~ denotes the bitwise NOT operation.
   - Use memoization to store the updated DP state.

3. To find the winning teams, iterate over all teams j = 0 to 2^n-1 and check if any team has won at least one game in each phase by checking dp[n][j] is not empty.

4. Sort the winning teams in ascending order and output them.
