This plan correctly captures the essence of the problem. However, it might be improved by using a more efficient data structure instead of sets to store the memoized results.

As for potential issues with the plan, one issue is that the current state expression dp[i][j][k] doesn't consider all possible winning conditions for a team j with skill level k in phase i. It only checks if team j can win from the i-th phase onwards. A more comprehensive approach would be to check for all possible combinations of teams and their opponents.

The plan also doesn't handle edge cases, such as when n is 0 or 1, which should be handled separately.
