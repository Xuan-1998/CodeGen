===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the tournament into smaller phases, and use dynamic programming to find all possible winning teams for each phase. Then combine the results from each phase to get the final list of winning teams.

The state expression is the current number of winning teams found so far, and the base case is when there are no more teams to consider, in which case the current set of winning teams is the final answer.

Consider two cases: the current team wins, and it loses. In both cases, update the state by recursively calling the function with the updated state.

To avoid redundant calculations, implement memoization by creating a dictionary that maps the state (current number of winning teams) to the corresponding result (set of winning teams).

At each phase, calculate the total number of possible winning teams and use this value as the recursive case for the next phase. This ensures that the function explores all possible combinations.

When combining the results from each phase, sort the lists of winning teams by their skill levels in ascending order to ensure a consistent output.
