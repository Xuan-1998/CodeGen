===BEGIN PLAN===
Maintain a dictionary dp where dp[(i, s)] is a list of winning teams for the prefix s up to phase i.

Let the state be a tuple (i, s) where i is the current phase and s is the binary string from the 0th to the ith phase.
The base case is when i = n. In this case, dp[(n, s)] will store all winning teams for the given tournament result s.

For each phase i, iterate over all possible values of k such that k is a skill level that can win in the ith phase.
If s[i] is 1 (win), then the next state would be (i+1, k+s[i]).
Update dp[(i, s)] with all teams that have won at least one game in each phase up to i.

To find the winning teams for the given tournament result, iterate over all possible values of s and check if any team has won at least one game in each phase. If yes, add it to the list of winning teams.
Return the list of winning teams in ascending order.
