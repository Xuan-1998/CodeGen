===BEGIN PLAN===
Maintain a dictionary memo where the key is a tuple (i, s) and the value is a list of winning teams for the first i phases when the binary string s represents the results.

For each prefix of the input binary string, update the dp table based on whether the current phase was won by the team with skill level 1 or not. If it was won by this team, add its index to the memoized result and mark this team as a winner for the remaining phases. If not, update the memoized result with all teams that have not lost yet.

To find all winning teams, iterate over the dp table in reverse order and check if any team has won at least one game in each phase. These are the winning teams.
