===BEGIN PLAN===
Maintain two arrays dp and res where dp[i][j] represents whether team j has won at least one game after i phases and res[i] is an array of winning teams for i-th phase. Transition from dp[i-1][k] to dp[i][j] based on s[i]^j.
Base case: If n=1, return all indices where the corresponding value in s is 1 as these are the winning teams.

For n > 1:
    Initialize res[n].
    For i from 0 to n:
        Initialize dp[i-1] and a set of winning teams for this phase.
        For j from 0 to 2^n - 1:
            If (s[i]^j) == 1, then team j has won at least one game in this phase. 
                Add j to the set of winning teams for this phase if it is not already there.
            Update dp[i-1][k] = True where k in the set of winning teams for this phase.
        res[i] = the set of winning teams for this phase.
    Return the set of all winning teams for all phases, i.e., res[n].
