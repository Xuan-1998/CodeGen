===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider teams that have won at least one game in each phase of the tournament, and use dynamic programming to find all such teams.

Memoize the results for faster computation.

The base case is when n == 1, as there's only one winning team in a single-game tournament.

To consider each binary string of length n as the current state, where the state is 'winning' if all bits are 1 (i.e., the team has won in every game) and 'losing' otherwise.

Use a 2D array dp[n][1<<n] to store the results of subproblems, where each subproblem represents a binary string of length n. Let dp[i][mask] be true if there's at least one winning team for the first i phases with the given mask (i.e., which teams have won in each phase).

The recurrence relation is:

- If the current bit is 1, then all winning teams must also win in this phase.
- If the current bit is 0, then some winning teams might lose in this phase.

So, dp[i][mask] = or (dp[i-1][mask & ~(1<<j)] and j-th bit of mask is 0) for each j from 0 to i-1.

To get all the winning teams, iterate through the last row of dp (i.e., when n phases are done), and for each mask that has at least one '1', add the teams corresponding to the 1's in mask to the result.
