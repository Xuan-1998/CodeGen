===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider teams that have won at least one game in each phase of the tournament, and use dynamic programming to find all such teams. Memoize the results for faster computation.

State expression: dp[i][j] = True if team j can win from the i-th phase onwards; otherwise False.
dp[i][j] = (s[i] == '1' and any k in range(i) where s[k] == '1') or (i == n-1 and s[i] == '1')
This plan correctly captures the essence of the problem. It uses dynamic programming to find all teams that can win at least one game in each phase.

The state expression dp[i][j] checks if team j can win from the i-th phase onwards. If the current phase (i) is a winning phase (s[i] == '1'), then team j can win if it won in any previous winning phase (any k in range(i) where s[k] == '1'). If this is the last phase (i == n-1), then team j can only win if it wins in the current phase.

This plan includes edge cases by considering all phases of the tournament and handling the case when it's the last phase.
