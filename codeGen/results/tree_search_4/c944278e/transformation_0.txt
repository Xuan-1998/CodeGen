===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider teams that have won at least one game in each phase of the tournament, and use dynamic programming to find all such teams. Memoize the results for faster computation.

State expression: dp[i][j] = True if team j can win from the i-th phase onwards; otherwise False.
dp[i][j] = (s[i] == '1' and (exists k such that 0 <= k < 2^i, s[k] == '1' and dp[i-1][k])) for all j such that 0 <= j < 2^i
Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table, where dp[i][j] represents whether team j can win from phase i onwards.

Initialize dp[0][j] = (s[0] == '1') for all j such that 0 <= j < 2^0

For each phase i from 1 to n-1:
    For each team j such that 0 <= j < 2^i
        Set dp[i][j] = True if and only if there exists a team k such that s[k] == '1' and k < 2^(i-1) and dp[i-1][k]
    If no such team k exists, set dp[i][j] = False

To find all winning teams:
    For each phase i from 0 to n-1
        For each team j such that 0 <= j < 2^i
            If dp[i][j], print the team
