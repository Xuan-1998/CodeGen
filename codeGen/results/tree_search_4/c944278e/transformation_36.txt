===BEGIN PLAN===
Maintain two arrays:
dp[i][j] represents whether team j is still in the competition after i phases.
winning_teams[i][j] represents the winning teams for each prefix of length i.

The base case would be when the input has only one phase, in which case all teams that have won at least one game are considered winning teams. So, dp[0][j] = True for all j, and winning_teams[0][j] is just {j} if s[0] = 1.

For each subsequent phase i:
    Transition from dp[i-1][j] to dp[i][j] based on s[i]. If s[i] = 1, then the winner of this phase remains in the competition. So, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] if s[i] = 1.
    Update winning_teams[i][j] as follows: if s[i] = 1 and j is a winning team for the previous phase (dp[i-1][j]), then it's also a winning team for this phase. If s[i] = 0, then all teams that were winning teams for the previous phase are eliminated.

The final answer would be the set of teams that are still in the competition and have won at least one game in each phase.
