===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the tournament into smaller phases, and use dynamic programming to find all possible winning teams for each phase. Then combine the results from each phase to get the final list of winning teams.

A state represents the skill levels of all teams that have not been eliminated yet, and the base case is when only one team remains.

Use a dictionary to store the winning teams for each phase, where the keys are the current state of the tournament and the values are lists of winning teams. This allows us to efficiently look up the winning teams for a given state.

For each phase, iterate over all possible states (i.e., combinations of skill levels that have not been eliminated yet). For each state, calculate the next possible states by iterating over all teams with those skill levels and simulating the tournament outcome for each team. This can be done using a simple recursive function that checks if a team wins or loses based on its skill level compared to the opponents.

Store the winning teams for each phase in the dictionary, and then combine the results from each phase to get the final list of winning teams.
