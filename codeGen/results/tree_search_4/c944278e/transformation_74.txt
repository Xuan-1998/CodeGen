This plan is correct, and it includes edge cases. The only potential issue is that the space complexity could be high due to the use of a 2D table. However, this can be mitigated by using bit manipulation to represent the states.

The updated version of the plan includes a transition function that updates the state based on the results of matches, and it uses dynamic programming with a 2D table to find all possible winning teams for each phase. The final result is obtained by iterating through the 2^n possible teams and checking if any team has not been eliminated.
