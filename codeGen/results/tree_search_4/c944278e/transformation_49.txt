===BEGIN PLAN===
Maintain a binary string where '1' represents a win and '0' represents a loss. 
Use memoization to store the winning teams for each prefix of the string. 

For each phase, update the memoization array with the winning teams for that phase. This can be done by iterating through each team, checking if it has won at least one game in that phase, and adding it to the list of winning teams.

Then, use this memoization array to find all the winning teams by iterating through each phase again and finding the intersection of the lists of winning teams for each phase. This will give you the winning teams that have won at least one game in each phase.

To make this more efficient, consider using a hash map or set to store the winning teams instead of a list, so that lookups are O(1) instead of O(n).
