===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the tournament into smaller phases, and use dynamic programming to find all possible winning teams for each phase. Then combine the results from each phase to get the final list of winning teams.

A state represents the skill levels of all teams that have not been eliminated yet, and the base case is when only one team remains.

Use a 2D table to store the number of winning teams for each phase, where the rows represent the remaining teams and the columns represent the possible skill levels of the next team. For each cell in the table, calculate the number of ways the current game can be won by any of the remaining teams with the given skill level.

The main idea is to iterate through all phases, from 1 to n, and for each phase:

- If there's only one team left, consider it as a winning team.
- If more than one team remains, calculate the number of winning teams for this phase based on the previous phase. For each possible skill level of the next team:
  - Count the number of ways the current game can be won by any of the remaining teams with the given skill level.
  - Add the result to the total count of winning teams for this phase.

Finally, combine the results from all phases to get the final list of winning teams in ascending order.

The plan looks correct and includes edge cases. It's a good approach to solve this problem using dynamic programming.
