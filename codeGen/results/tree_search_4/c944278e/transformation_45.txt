===BEGIN PLAN===
Maintain a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the winning teams for the first i phases, with j being the skill level of the team.
For each phase k from 0 to n-1:
    For each possible skill level j from 0 to 2^k - 1:
        If s[k] is '1' and dp[k-1][j>>k] exists and contains winning teams for the first k-1 phases with a team having a skill level of j>>k:
            Update dp[k][j] with the union of dp[k-1][j>>k] and the winning teams that won against the team with a skill level of j>>k
        Else:
            If s[k] is '0' and dp[k-1][j>>k] exists and contains winning teams for the first k-1 phases with a team having a skill level of j>>k:
                Update dp[k][j] with the set difference between dp[k-1][j>>k] and the losing teams that lost against the team with a skill level of j>>k
            Else:
                Set dp[k][j] to an empty set

At the end, return all winning teams in ascending order by iterating over the values in dp[n-1]
