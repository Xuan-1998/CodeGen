Approach: Use top-down approach with memoization to compute the maximum and minimum number of times the shortest path from a vertex to t needs to be recomputed.

State: Let f(v) be the function that returns the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path from a vertex to t needs to be recomputed. The base case is when v = t, where the shortest path has already been computed and does not need to be recomputed.

State: f(v) is the function that returns the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path from a vertex to t needs to be recomputed, given that we are at vertex v, and have not recomputed the shortest path from v to t yet.

Define a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by iterating over vertices in topological order. For each vertex, maintain the minimum and maximum number of recomputations as you go.

For each vertex u, compute f(u) by considering all its outgoing edges and recursively calling f(v) for each vertex v reachable from u. Update the minimum and maximum counts based on the results of these recursive calls.

If the driver chooses to follow the recommended path, increment the minimum count by 1 (since we didn't need to recomputed), and update the maximum count by the result of the recursive call.

If the driver doesn't follow the recommended path, increment both the minimum and maximum counts by the result of the recursive call.

Return f(s) as the final answer.
