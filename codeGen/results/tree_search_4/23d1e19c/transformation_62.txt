===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with memoization: We can precompute and store the results of expensive function calls (i.e., calculating the minimum and maximum recomputation times for each vertex) in a 2D DP table. This will help avoid redundant computations by reusing stored results when the same inputs occur again.

The pair (v, k), where k is the number of vertices in the fixed path from s to t that come after v.
Use a 2D DP table with dimensions n*m, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum and maximum recomputation times for vertex i on the jth recomputation.

Initialize the DP table: Set dp[0][0] to (0, 0) since there is no recomputation needed at the starting vertex.
Fill in the DP table:
    - For each vertex v from 1 to n-1, calculate the minimum and maximum recomputation times for vertex v on the jth recomputation as follows:
        - If k = 0 (i.e., we have reached the end of the fixed path), set dp[v][j] to (0, 0).
        - Otherwise, consider two cases: 
            + Follow the recommended path: Set dp[v][j] to min(dp[v-1][j-1], 1) and max(dp[v-1][j-1], 1) since we either follow the previous recomputation or start a new one.
            + Don't follow the recommended path: Set dp[v][j] to min(dp[v-1][j], 1) and max(dp[v-1][j], 1) since we either continue with the previous recomputation or start a new one.
    - For each vertex v from n-1 down to 0, calculate the minimum and maximum recomputation times for vertex v on the jth recomputation as follows:
        - If k = 0 (i.e., we have reached the end of the fixed path), set dp[v][j] to (0, 0).
        - Otherwise, consider two cases: 
            + Follow the recommended path: Set dp[v][j] to min(dp[v+1][j-1], 1) and max(dp[v+1][j-1], 1) since we either follow the previous recomputation or start a new one.
            + Don't follow the recommended path: Set dp[v][j] to min(dp[v+1][j], 1) and max(dp[v+1][j], 1) since we either continue with the previous recomputation or start a new one.

Return the minimum and maximum values from the DP table.
