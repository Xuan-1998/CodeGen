===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to solve this problem by creating a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and look up the results instead of recomputing them.

The state is represented by (v, k), where v is the current vertex in the fixed path from s to t, and k is the number of vertices in the fixed path from s to t that come after v.

Create a dictionary dp to store the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path from the current vertex to t needs to be recomputed when reaching the current vertex with k vertices left in the path. Initialize dp[(v, 0)] = (0, 0) for all vertices v.

For each edge (u, v), update dp[(v, k)] as follows:

    If there is no edge from v to t or k == 1:
        dp[(v, k)] = (1, 1)
    Else:
        Update dp[(v, k)] using the information of the shortest path from u to t and the number of vertices left in the path.

The final answer is dp[(t, 0)].
