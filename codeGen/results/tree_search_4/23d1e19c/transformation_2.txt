===BEGIN PLAN===
Code a single DP array of size n+1, where dp[i] represents the maximum number of times the shortest path from vertex i to t needs to be recomputed.

dp[n] = 0
for k in range(k-1, -1, -1):
    for j in range(p_k, p_(k-1), -1):
        if j == s: continue
        dp[j] = min(dp[j], 1 + max(0, dp[k]))

Print the maximum and minimum of the DP array.
