===BEGIN PLAN===
Approach: Use top-down approach with memoization to compute the maximum and minimum number of times the shortest path from a vertex to t needs to be recomputed.

State:
Let dp[i][j] represent the number of times recomputation is needed when we are at vertex p_i, having recomputed i times previously.
For base case, consider vertices in the fixed path. 
dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of times recomputation is needed when we are at vertex p_i, having recomputed j times previously.

Use a dynamic programming table dp[][] to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computations.

State Transition:
- If the current vertex is not in the fixed path, then 
  - The minimum number of recomputations will be the minimum of the number of recomputations at the previous vertices, plus one (for recomputation when reaching the current vertex).
  - The maximum number of recomputations will be the maximum of the number of recomputations at the previous vertices, plus one (for recomputation when reaching the current vertex).
- If the current vertex is in the fixed path, then 
  - The minimum number of recomputations remains the same as the previous vertex.
  - The maximum number of recomputations will be the minimum of the number of recomputations at the previous vertices, plus one (for recomputation when reaching the current vertex).

Base Case:
- For the last vertex in the fixed path, dp[i][j] = 0.

Return Statement:
- Return the values of dp[k-1][0] and dp[k-1][max_recomputation] as the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path from a vertex to t needs to be recomputed.
