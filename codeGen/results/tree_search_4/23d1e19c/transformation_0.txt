===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The shortest path from a vertex to t can be recomputed when the driver chooses not to follow the recommended path, i.e., at each vertex, there are two choices (follow the recommended path or not), and this choice affects the next vertex's shortest path. Hence, there are overlapping subproblems.

Use a 2D DP table with a size of (k+1) x m, where k is the number of vertices in the fixed path from s to t.
dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[j-1][k]; // initialize the DP table
for i in range(k+1):
    for j in range(1, m+1):
        if j <= k:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][k])
        else:
            dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[j-1][k]
Return the minimum and maximum values from the DP table as the answer.
