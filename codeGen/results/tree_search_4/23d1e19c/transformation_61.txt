===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with memoization to store and update the shortest distances and recomputation counts for each vertex.

Let dp[i] = (min_count, max_count) represent the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path from the current vertex i to t needs to be recomputed.
Design a custom data structure, perhaps an array or vector, to efficiently store and update dp values.

For each edge in the graph, calculate the new dp value for the destination vertex based on the source vertex's dp value. The new dp value would represent the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path from the destination vertex to t needs to be recomputed if the driver follows the recommended path from the current vertex.

To ensure correctness, consider edge cases such as when the fixed path is trivial (i.e., s = t) or when there are no recomputations needed.
