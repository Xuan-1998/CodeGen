===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with memoization: Since there are overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, it's suitable to use dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem. Memoization can help avoid redundant computations by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.

DP on a subset of vertices: Consider the state as the current vertex, and the transition is to the next vertex in the path. The goal is to find the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path from the current vertex to t needs to be recomputed.

Memoization approach:

* Initialize an empty dictionary dp to store the results of subproblems.
* Define a function f(current_vertex) that returns the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path from the current vertex to t needs to be recomputed. This function should use memoization to avoid redundant computations.
* For each vertex in the path, call f(current_vertex) and update dp accordingly.
* Finally, return the results stored in dp.

Edge cases:

* Handle the case where k = 1 (i.e., there is only one vertex in the path).
* Handle the case where s = t (i.e., the start and end vertices are the same).
