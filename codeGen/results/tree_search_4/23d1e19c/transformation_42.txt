===BEGIN PLAN===
Approach: Combine bottom-up and top-down approaches with memoization to compute the maximum and minimum number of times the shortest path from a vertex to t needs to be recomputed.

State:
- Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum number of times recomputation is needed when we are at vertex p_i, having recomputed j times previously.
- Let min_dp[i][j] represent the minimum number of times recomputation is needed when we are at vertex p_i, having recomputed j times previously.

Transition relationship:
- For all vertices u in the fixed path such that an edge exists from u to p_i,
  - dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[u][k-1]) for all k < j
  - min_dp[i][j] = 1 + min(min_dp[u][k-1]) for all k < j
- If there's no edge from u to p_i, then dp[i][j] and min_dp[i][j] are both 0

Base case:
- For vertices in the fixed path (p_1, p_2, ..., p_k), set dp[i][0] = 0 for all i
- Set min_dp[i][0] = 0 for all i

Edge cases:
- Handle edge cases where the shortest path is not recomputed at all.
- Handle edge cases where the shortest path is always recomputed.

Hybrid approach:
- Use memoization to store the results of subproblems.
- Use tabulation to precompute and store the values in dp and min_dp arrays.
- Combine the two approaches to optimize computation time.
