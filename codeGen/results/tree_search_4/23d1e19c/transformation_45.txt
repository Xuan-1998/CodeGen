===BEGIN PLAN===
Approach: Use top-down approach with memoization and dynamic programming to compute the maximum and minimum number of times the shortest path from a vertex to t needs to be recomputed.

State:
Let dp[i][j] represent the minimum number of times recomputation is needed when we are at vertex p_i, having recomputed j times previously.
For each edge (u, p_i) in the graph, update dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[u][k-1]) if there's an edge from u to p_i. Otherwise, set it to 0.

Transition:
Let dp_max[i] be the maximum number of times recomputation is needed when we are at vertex p_i.
Update dp_max[i] = max(dp_max[u] + 1) for all edges (u, p_i) in the graph.

Base Case: For vertices in the fixed path, set dp[0][j] to j and dp_max[0] to k-1.

Main Function:
Return min(dp[k-1][0]), max(dp_max).
