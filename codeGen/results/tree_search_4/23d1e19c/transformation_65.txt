Use dynamic programming with memoization: The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming and memoization. This approach will avoid redundant computations by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.

Maintain a dictionary to store the shortest distances from each vertex to t, and another dictionary for the number of recomputations needed at each vertex.
Use these dictionaries to compute the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path needs to be recomputed along the fixed path from s to t.

This approach ensures that the same subproblems are not solved multiple times, which makes it efficient. It also handles edge cases correctly as any vertex in the graph can have an out-degree equal to 0.
