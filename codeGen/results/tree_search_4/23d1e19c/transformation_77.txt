===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming: Since there are overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, it's suitable to use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Dynamic programming can help avoid redundant computations by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.

The state could be defined as (v, p) where v is the current vertex and p is the path from s to t at that vertex.
Use a priority queue to memoize the states with their corresponding minimum and maximum number of recomputations. Initialize the priority queue with an initial state (s, [s]).

For each edge in the graph:
    If the current vertex v is in the path p:
        Calculate the new path by appending the edge's destination to the path.
        Update the priority queue with the new state (new_vertex, p) and its corresponding minimum and maximum number of recomputations.

When processing a new state (v, p):
    If p includes t:
        Return the result stored in the priority queue for this state as the minimum and maximum number of recomputations.
    Else:
        Calculate the new path by appending the destination of the shortest path from v to t to the path.
        Update the priority queue with the new state (new_vertex, p) and its corresponding minimum and maximum number of recomputations.
