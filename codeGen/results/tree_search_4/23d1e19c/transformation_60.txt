===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming: Since there are overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, it's suitable to use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Dynamic programming can help avoid redundant computations by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.

Create a memoization table dp[v][i] where v is the current vertex, i is the number of recomputations needed so far, and dp[v][i] stores the minimum and maximum distance from the current vertex to t after i recomputations. Initialize all values in the memoization table to negative infinity.

For each vertex on the fixed path:
  - Start from the first vertex v in the path.
  - If this is the starting point, set dp[v][0] = [distance from s to v, distance from s to v].
  - For i from 1 to k:
    + Compute the minimum and maximum number of recomputations needed if we follow the recommended path until we reach vertex t. This can be done by recursively calling a function that computes this for all vertices reachable from v.
    + If the recomputation count exceeds k, update dp[v][i] with [dp[v][i-1][0], dp[v][i-1][1]].
    + Otherwise, update dp[v][i] with [min(dp[u][j][0] + distance from u to v for all edges (u,v)) + distance from s to v, max(dp[u][j][1] + distance from u to v for all edges (u,v)) + distance from s to v].

Finally, return the minimum and maximum values in dp[t][-1].
