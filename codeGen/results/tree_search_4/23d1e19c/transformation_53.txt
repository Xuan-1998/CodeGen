Approach: Use top-down approach with memoization to compute the maximum and minimum number of times the shortest path from a vertex to t needs to be recomputed. This can be done by defining a function that takes a vertex as input and returns the maximum and minimum lengths of recommended paths between vertices in the fixed path.

State: Define state as a 2D array dp where dp[u][v] represents the minimum and maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex u to v along the recommended path. Base case is when we are at vertex t, since there's no more recomputation needed.

State dp[i][j] as a tuple (min_recom, max_recom) representing the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path from vertex i to vertex j needs to be recomputed.

Transition relationship: if there's an edge from u to v in the graph, then dp[u][v] = min(dp[u][p], 1) + dp[p][v] for all p in the fixed path from s to t such that u to p and p to v are both edges in the graph. This represents the minimum and maximum number of recomputations needed to get from vertex u to vertex v along the recommended path.

Define a dynamic programming table dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum and maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to j along the recommended path, and use it to compute the results.
