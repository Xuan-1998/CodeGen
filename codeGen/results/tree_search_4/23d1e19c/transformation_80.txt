===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming: Since there are overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, it's suitable to use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Dynamic programming can help avoid redundant computations by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.

The state could be defined as (v, d) where v is the current vertex and d is the distance from v to t along the fixed path.

To implement a bottom-up dynamic programming solution using a 1D array to store the maximum number of times the shortest path needs to be recomputed for each vertex. 

For each edge in the graph, update the dp state at the destination vertex by considering all previous vertices along the fixed path that are closer to t than the current vertex.

To get the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path needs to be recomputed, iterate over all vertices in the fixed path from s to t, and keep track of the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path needs to be recomputed.

Finally, return the minimum and maximum number as the answer.
