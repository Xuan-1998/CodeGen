Approach: Use top-down approach with memoization to compute the maximum and minimum number of times the shortest path from a vertex to t needs to be recomputed.

State:
Let dp[i][j] represent the number of times recomputation is needed when we are at vertex pi, having recomputed i times previously. For base case, consider vertices in the fixed path.
dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of times recomputation is needed when we are at vertex pi, having recomputed j times previously.

Define a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary or a hash table to store the intermediate results.
For each vertex v:
    If v is in the fixed path:
        Compute dp[v][0] as 1 because no recomputation is needed initially
    For each edge (u, v) in the graph:
        If u is in the fixed path and v is not:
            Update dp[v][i] = min(dp[v][i], dp[u][j] + 1)
        If u is not in the fixed path and v is:
            Update dp[v][i] = max(dp[v][i], dp[u][j] + 1)

Base case: For vertices at the end of the fixed path, set dp[i][0] as 1 because no recomputation is needed initially
