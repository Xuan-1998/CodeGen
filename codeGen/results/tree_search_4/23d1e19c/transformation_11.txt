===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The shortest path from a vertex to t can be recomputed when the driver chooses not to follow the recommended path, i.e., at each vertex, there are two choices (follow the recommended path or not), and this choice affects the next vertex's shortest path. Hence, there are overlapping subproblems.
dp[i][j] = (p[j-1] == p[k]) ? dp[i][j-1] : 1 + dp[0][k]; // Incorrect initialization
Consider initializing dp with all zeros or ones based on whether each vertex is part of the fixed path. This ensures that the shortest path from a vertex to t can be recomputed when the driver chooses not to follow the recommended path.
dp[i][j] = (p[j-1] == p[k]) ? 0 : 1; // Initialize dp with zeros or ones
Maintain a memoization table for this calculation. Then, consider the minimum number of times the shortest path needs to be recomputed when the driver chooses not to follow the recommended path.
Consider calculating min and max values separately:
Min: The minimum number of times the shortest path needs to be recomputed is the minimum number of vertices along the fixed path that are not part of the recommended path. This can be calculated using a simple iteration over the fixed path.
Max: The maximum possible number of recomputations occurs when the driver chooses not to follow the recommended path at every vertex, i.e., the maximum number of times the shortest path from each vertex to t needs to be recalculated is equal to the length of the fixed path minus one.
Calculate min and max values separately:
min = 0; // Initialize minimum value
for (int j = k-1; j >= 1; j--) {
    if (p[j] != p[j-1]) {
        min++;
    }
}
max = k - 2; // Maximum possible number of recomputations
Print the result as a single line containing two integers, the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path from the current vertex to t needs to be recomputed.
Output: {min, max}
