===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming: Since there are overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, it's suitable to use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Dynamic programming can help avoid redundant computations by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.

The state could be defined as (v, d) where v is the current vertex and d is the distance from v to t along the fixed path.

To implement a bottom-up dynamic programming solution using a 3D array dp[i][j][k] where i is the current vertex, j is the distance from the current vertex to t along the fixed path, and k is the number of recomputations needed for the shortest path from the current vertex to t. The value at dp[i][j][0] would represent the minimum number of times the shortest path needs to be recomputed when the distance is j.

For each vertex v in the graph, we can iterate through all possible distances d from 1 to k and compute the minimum number of times the shortest path needs to be recomputed for each distance. This can be done by iterating over all vertices u that are one edge away from v and updating dp[i][j][k] if necessary.

The maximum number of times the shortest path needs to be recomputed is simply the maximum value in the 3D array dp.
