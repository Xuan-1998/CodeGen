===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure, as we can break it down into smaller subproblems that share the same optimal solution. For instance, we can find the maximum possible length for different segments within the given time range.

Consider the maximum length of segments up to time t with speeds from 1 to i, for some constant i, as a state. The base case would be when t is equal to the given time and no more segments can be added.

The state could be the remaining time r and the current speed s, with the maximum length of segment up to remaining time r with speeds from s to initial final speed range being the state value.

Let dp[(r, s)] denote the maximum possible length of segments up to remaining time r with speeds from s to initial final speed range. The recurrence relation would be:

dp[(t, i)] = max(dp[(t - 1, j)] + |i - j| * (initial_speed <= i && i <= final_speed) for j in range(initial_speed, final_speed + 1))

The base case is when t is equal to the given time and no more segments can be added.

Let's initialize dp with negative infinity values to handle edge cases where we add segments up to remaining time r with speeds from s to initial final speed range. We also need to handle the case where there are no more segments that can be added (t = 0).

The maximum possible length of segments would be the value at dp[(time, initial_speed)].
