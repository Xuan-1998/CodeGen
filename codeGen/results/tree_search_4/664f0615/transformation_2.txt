The state is a pair (t, v) representing the current time t and speed v. The base case is when the time t reaches the given time range or the speed v equals the initial or final speed.

Let's use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We can create a 2D array dp[t][v] where each cell represents the maximum possible length of the path segment at time t and speed v.

The transition relationship is as follows:
dp(t, v) = max(dp(t-1, v-k)+k for k in range(max_allowed_change_in_speed+1))
where we try all possible speeds from v-k to v+k that satisfy the maximum allowed change in speed between any two adjacent seconds. We take the maximum of these possibilities because we want to find the longest path segment.

The final answer would be dp(time, final_speed), which represents the maximum possible length of the path segment at time=time and speed=final_speed.
