===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure, as we can break it down into smaller subproblems that share the same optimal solution. For instance, we can find the maximum possible length for different segments within the given time range.

A state is defined by the current speed s, the maximum allowed change in speed d, and the remaining time left r. The base case is when all the time has been used or there's only one possible speed left.

The state can be a tuple of (speed_segment, time_left) where speed_segment is an array of possible speeds for that segment and time_left represents the remaining time in that segment. Transitions would involve adding or removing speeds from the segment based on whether we're at the beginning or end of the segment and updating the remaining time accordingly.

You can create a recursive function that takes into account the base case and iteratively updates the maximum possible length based on the remaining time. We can start by initializing the state with the initial speed, the final speed, and the given time range. Then we can recursively update the state by iterating over all possible speeds within the given change limit, considering the base cases when the remaining time is zero or there's only one possible speed left.
