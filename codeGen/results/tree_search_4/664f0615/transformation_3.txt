===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure, as we can break it down into smaller subproblems that share the same optimal solution. For instance, we can find the maximum possible length for different segments within the given time range.

Consider the maximum length of segments up to time t with speeds from 1 to i, for some constant i, as a state. The base case would be when t is equal to the given time and no more segments can be added.

The state could be the remaining time r and the current speed s, with the maximum length of segment up to remaining time r with speeds from s to initial final speed range being the state value.

Create a 2D table where each cell represents the maximum possible length for a given remaining time and current speed. Initialize all cells in the first row (time=0) to 0, as there are no segments at time 0.

Fill up the table by iterating over the given time t and considering all possible speeds s from initial to final speed. For each cell, calculate the maximum length of segment that can be added given the remaining time r and current speed s, ensuring that the absolute difference between adjacent speeds does not exceed the allowed change in speed.

The state value for a cell would be the maximum length of segment up to the given time t with speeds from s to initial final speed range. The base case would be when the remaining time is 0, in which case the maximum possible length is 0.

Once the table is filled, return the value at the bottom-right corner as the maximum possible length for the entire path section.
