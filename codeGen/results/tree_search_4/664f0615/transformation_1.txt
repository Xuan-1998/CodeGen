===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure, as we can break it down into smaller subproblems that share the same optimal solution. For instance, we can find the maximum possible length for different segments within the given time range.

The state is a tuple (t, v) representing the current time t and speed v. The base case is when the time t reaches the given time range or the speed v equals the initial or final speed.

The transition relationship is dp(t, v) = max(dp(t-1, min(v+max_allowed_change_in_speed, final_speed)) + (v-min(initial_speed, v)), for min(initial_speed, v) to min(final_speed, v)), where we try all possible speeds from min(initial_speed, v) to min(final_speed, v) that satisfy the maximum allowed change in speed between any two adjacent seconds.

We can improve this plan by implementing memoization using a dictionary where the key is the state (t, v) and the value is the maximum possible length.

This plan does not include edge cases. To handle edge cases, we need to consider what happens when t or v reaches the initial or final speed.
