===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure, as we can break it down into smaller subproblems that share the same optimal solution. For instance, we can find the maximum possible length for different segments within the given time range.

A state is defined by the current speed s, the maximum allowed change in speed d, and the remaining time left r. The base case is when all the time has been used or there's only one possible speed left.

The state can be a tuple of (speed_segment, time_left) where speed_segment is an array of possible speeds for that segment and time_left represents the remaining time in that segment. Transitions would involve adding or removing speeds from the segment based on whether we're at the beginning or end of the segment and updating the remaining time accordingly.

To avoid repeated calculations, memoization can be used with recursion by storing intermediate results in a dictionary. This way, once a subproblem has been solved, its solution is stored and won't need to be recalculated again.

The plan includes edge cases such as when there's only one possible speed left or all the time has been used.
