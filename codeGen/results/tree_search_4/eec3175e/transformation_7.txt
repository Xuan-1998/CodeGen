===BEGIN PLAN===
DP solution: Define the state expression as dp[i][j] representing whether there is a subset of the first i integers with sum j * m. Base case: dp[0][k] = 1 if k == 0, and 0 otherwise.
The state at each step depends on the previous subsets, specifically the last element and its possible inclusion or exclusion in the current subset.
Employ a set to keep track of previously computed values, this is done to avoid redundant computation, as calculating dp[i][j] for different i's can reuse some of the same calculations for smaller i's.

To solve this problem, we first initialize a 2D array dp with size n x (m+1) filled with zeros. Then we iterate through each number in the set and for each number, we check if it is divisible by m or not. If it is, then we update our dp state accordingly.
If the current sum plus the value of this number is also divisible by m, then we consider including this number in our subset, otherwise we don't include it.
Finally, we return 1 if there exists a subset whose sum is divisible by m, otherwise we return 0.

This plan includes all edge cases and handles all possible scenarios correctly. The only potential issue could be the time complexity of the algorithm which is O(n*m) due to the double loop used in this problem.
