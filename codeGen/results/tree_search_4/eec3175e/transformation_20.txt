===BEGIN PLAN===
There is a recursive relationship between smaller instances of the problem, allowing top-down memoization to work effectively.

A subset sum that is divisible by m
State: Given n and m, a set S of non-negative integers with sum S_sum; Transition relationship: The problem can be broken down into smaller instances by considering all possible subsets of S, where each subset sums up to (S_sum % m) + k, for 0 <= k < m. We can transition from the base case (n = 1) to larger instances by including or excluding elements from the set.

Using a dictionary-based approach for memoization where the key is the tuple (n, m, S_sum % m) and the value is the boolean result of whether there exists a subset with sum divisible by m. The base case would be when n = 1, in which case we can simply return whether S_sum % m == 0.

We also need to consider edge cases: if n < 1 or m < 1, return 0 as there cannot exist a subset with sum divisible by a non-positive value.
