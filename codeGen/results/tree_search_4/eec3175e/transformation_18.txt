===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem, with some overlap in the computation between instances. Memoization would be effective.

DP solution: Define the state expression as dp[i][k] representing whether there is a subset of the first i integers with sum k % m.
Base case: dp[0][j] = 1 if j == 0, and 0 otherwise.

Let dp[i][k] be True if there exists a subset of the first i numbers with sum equal to k % m, and False otherwise. Define a 2D array dp where dp[i][k] = True if there exists a subset of the first i numbers with sum equal to k % m, and False otherwise.

To fill up the dp table, iterate over each number from 1 to n-1. For each number i, iterate from 0 to m-1 and update dp[i+1][k] = (dp[i+1][k] or dp[i][k-m]) if k <= (n-1)*m.
Finally, return dp[n-1][k] for the given value of k.
