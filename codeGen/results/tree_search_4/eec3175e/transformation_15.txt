===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem, with some overlap in the computation between instances. Memoization would be effective.

DP solution: Define the state expression as dp[i][k] representing whether there is a subset of the first i integers with sum k mod m equals 0. Base case: dp[0][j] = 1 if j == 0, and 0 otherwise.

Define dp[i][j] as 1 if there exists a subset of the first i elements with sum j mod m equals 0, and 0 otherwise.

Memoize a function that calculates whether there exists a subset of the given array with sum k mod m equals 0.

For each element in the array, update dp[i][k] based on whether adding the current element to any subset resulting in a sum of k mod m equals 0. This would involve checking if dp[i-1][k-a[i]] is 1 for some integer a[i], where 0 <= a[i] <= i.

The function can be updated as follows:

    * If i == 0, return dp[0][k]
    * If k < 0, return 0
    * Otherwise, return (dp[i-1][k] || any(a[i] in the array where dp[i-1][k-a[i]] is 1))

This memoized function would allow for efficient computation of subsets with sum k mod m equals 0.

The plan includes edge cases: base case when i == 0, and handling negative sums.
