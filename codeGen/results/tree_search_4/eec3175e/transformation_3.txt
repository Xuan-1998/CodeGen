===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem, with some overlap in the computation between instances. Memoization would be effective.

DP solution: Define the state expression as dp[i][j] representing whether there is a subset of the first i integers with sum j * m. Base case: dp[0][k] = 1 if k == 0, and 0 otherwise.
Define dp[i][j] as 1 if there exists a subset of the first i elements whose sum is equal to j * m, and 0 otherwise.

Memoize using dynamic programming by creating a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents whether there exists a subset of the first i integers with sum j*m.
For each integer in the set, update the memoization table by considering two possibilities: either include or exclude this integer from the subset. If including it makes the sum divisible by m, then consider updating the memoization table accordingly.

The updated memoization table will have the correct information for solving the problem. Then, to determine whether there is a subset whose sum is divisible by m, simply check if dp[n][m] equals 1.
