===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem, with some overlap in the computation between instances. Memoization would be effective.

DP solution: Define the state expression as dp[i][j] representing whether there is a subset of the first i integers with sum j * m. Base case: dp[0][k] = 1 if k == 0, and 0 otherwise.
The state at each step depends on the previous subsets, specifically the last element and its possible inclusion or exclusion in the current subset.

For each integer i from 1 to n, iterate over all integers j from 0 to m-1. If there is a subset of the first i-1 integers with sum (j - num[i] mod m) * m where num[i] is the ith element, then dp[i][j] = True.

Use a dictionary to store the intermediate results for faster lookup.
Initialize dp[0][k] for k in range(m) to 1 if k == 0 and 0 otherwise. Initialize dp[i][k] for i in range(n), k in range(m) to False.

For each integer i from 1 to n, update dp[i][j] for j in range(m) as follows: if (j - num[i] mod m) * m is less than or equal to m-1 and dp[i-1][((j - num[i] mod m) * m) % m] then set dp[i][j] to True.

Finally, iterate over all integers j from 0 to m-1. If dp[n][j], then return 1. Otherwise, return 0.
