===BEGIN PLAN===
There is a recursive relationship between smaller instances of the problem, allowing top-down memoization to work effectively.

The current total sum modulo m
The subsets considered are those that do not exceed m, so the state would be the current sum modulo m and the previous numbers in the subset.
The transition would be deciding whether to include or exclude the current number based on its value and the current sum.

The tabulation solution would use a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents whether there is a subset of {1, ..., n} with sum i mod m, considering numbers up to i.
For each number j in the range [0, n], we would check if including or excluding it makes the total sum modulo m smaller. If yes, then update the result accordingly.

To solve this problem, you need a function that takes three parameters: n, m and nums. This function should return 1 if there is a subset with sum divisible by m, otherwise 0.
The function would iterate over all numbers from 0 to m-1 and for each number j, it would check if there is a subset of the given set with sum j mod m.

For each number j in the range [0, n], we would check if including or excluding it makes the total sum modulo m smaller. If yes, then update the result accordingly.

Finally, return 1 if dp[m-1][j] is true for any j, otherwise 0.
