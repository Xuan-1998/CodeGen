===BEGIN PLAN===
There is a recursive relationship between smaller instances of the problem, allowing top-down memoization to work effectively.

A subset sum that is divisible by m
State: Given n, a subset sum that is less than m;
Transition relationship: The problem can be broken down into smaller instances by considering all possible subsets of S with sums that are less than m. We can transition from the base case (n = 1) to larger instances by including or excluding elements from the set.

Designing a memoized function using Python's built-in lru_cache decorator
@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def is_divisible(S, n, m):
    if n == 0:
        return True
    if S[n - 1] >= m:
        return False

    for i in range(1 << (n - 1)):
        if i & 1:
            # Include the current element
            if is_divisible(S[:i], n - 1, m):
                return True
        else:
            # Exclude the current element
            if is_divisible(S[i + 1:], n - 1, m):
                return True

    return False
