===BEGIN PLAN===
There is a recursive relationship between smaller instances of the problem, allowing top-down memoization to work effectively.

A subset sum that is divisible by m
State: Given n and m, a set S of non-negative integers with sum S_sum; Transition relationship: The problem can be broken down into smaller instances by considering all possible subsets of S, where each subset sums up to S_sum % m. We can transition from the base case (n = 1) to larger instances by including or excluding elements from the set.

The use of a dynamic programming array dp where dp[i] represents the presence or absence of a subset with sum i % m
dp[i] is true if and only if there exists a subset with sum i % m

Transition rules:
- If n = 1, then dp[S_sum % m] = (S_sum % m == 0) ? 1 : 0
- For n > 1, dp[i] = (dp[i] || exists(k in S, s[k] <= i && dp[i - s[k]]))

The plan includes edge cases: 
- The base case handles when n = 1
- The transition rules handle the recursive relationship between smaller instances of the problem
