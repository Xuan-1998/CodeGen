The problem can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem, with some overlap in the computation between instances. Memoization would be effective.

DP solution: Define the state expression as dp[i][j] representing whether there is a subset of the first i integers with sum j * m. Base case: dp[0][k] = 1 if k == 0, and 0 otherwise.
dp[i][j] represents whether there is a subset of the first i integers with sum j * m.

To use dynamic programming by defining nested loops that iterate over all possible subsets of the given set, keeping track of the sum of each subset and checking if it's divisible by m. 

For every integer in the set, consider adding it to the current subset (if its sum is less than or equal to j * m) or not. This is done recursively for smaller subsets.

The final answer would be dp[n][m], indicating whether there exists a subset with sum m.
