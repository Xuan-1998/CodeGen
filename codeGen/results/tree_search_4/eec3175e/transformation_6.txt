===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem, with some overlap in the computation between instances. Memoization would be effective.

DP solution: Define the state expression as dp[i][j] representing whether there is a subset of the first i integers with sum j * m. Base case: dp[0][k] = 1 if k == 0, and 0 otherwise.

The state at each step depends on the previous subsets, specifically the last element and its possible inclusion or exclusion in the current subset.

Utilize a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table:

    for i from 1 to n:
        for j from 0 to m - 1:
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] or (a[i-1] <= m and dp[i-1][j-a[i-1]])) if a[i-1] <= j else dp[i-1][j]

    return dp[n][m - 1]
