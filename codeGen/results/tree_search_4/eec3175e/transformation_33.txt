===BEGIN PLAN===
There is a recursive relationship between smaller instances of the problem, allowing top-down memoization to work effectively.\ 
The current total sum modulo m
The problem can be reduced to finding a subset with sum divisible by m for each prefix of the input array. The state then would be the prefix and the transition would be adding the next element to the prefix.
Employ dynamic programming with a 2D table to store intermediate results, where each cell represents whether there is a subset summing up to that value divisible by m.
For each cell in the table, calculate whether there exists a subset of the prefix summing up to that value and divisible by m.
Update the table accordingly for each cell. 
Then, check if the last row of the table has any cells representing a subset with sum divisible by m. If it does, return 1; otherwise, return 0.
