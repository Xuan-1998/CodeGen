===BEGIN PLAN===
There is a recursive relationship between smaller instances of the problem, allowing top-down memoization to work effectively.

A subset sum that is divisible by m
State: Given n and m, a subset sum that is divisible by m; Transition relationship: The problem can be broken down into smaller instances by considering all possible subsets of S with sums that are divisible by m. We can transition from the base case (n = 1) to larger instances by including or excluding elements from the set.

Use memoization with a custom hash function to store and retrieve results in a dictionary.

Base case: If n is 0, return 1 if m is 0; otherwise, return 0. This is because there are no subsets when n is 0, so it's always possible to find a sum divisible by m (when m is also 0). For any other value of m, we can't find such a subset.

Memoization: Create a dictionary to store the results of subproblems. The custom hash function should combine n and m into a single string or tuple that can be used as the key in the dictionary.

Recursive case: For each number in the set S, consider two possibilities:
    1. Include the current number in the subset.
    2. Exclude the current number from the subset.

For both cases, recursively call the function with the updated values of n and m, and store the results in the memoization dictionary if they are not already present.

Return statement: Return the value stored in the memoization dictionary for the given combination of n and m. If it's not found, it means that there is no subset sum divisible by m for this particular combination of n and m.
