===BEGIN PLAN===
DP state: subset of numbers from 0 to i, where i is the current number in the array.
Transition relationship:
    - If the sum of the current subset modulo m is less than or equal to m, then add the current number to the subset
    Initialize a memoization table with size n+1, and fill it recursively by considering the following cases for each element in the array:
        1. If the current sum modulo m is 0 (i.e., the sum is divisible by m), return 1 (there exists a subset whose sum is divisible by m)
        2. If the current number exceeds m, skip it and consider the next number
        3. Otherwise, recursively calculate the memoization value for the remaining numbers and add the current number to the subset if its addition results in a new sum modulo m that is less than or equal to m

The base case would be when i is equal to 0, in which case return 1 if the total sum modulo m is 0; otherwise, return 0.

The final answer would be the value at memoization table[n], which represents whether there exists a subset with sum divisible by m.
