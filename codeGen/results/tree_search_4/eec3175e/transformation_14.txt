===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem, with some overlap in the computation between instances. Memoization would be effective.

DP solution: Define the state expression as dp[i][k] representing whether there is a subset of the first i integers with sum k. Base case: dp[0][j] = 1 if j == 0, and 0 otherwise.
Define dp[i][j] as 1 if there exists a subset of the first i elements with sum (j + array[i]) mod m equals 0, and 0 otherwise.

Use dynamic programming to fill up a 2D table where dp[i][k] is true if there exists a subset of the first i integers with sum k mod m equals 0
For each element in the array, update the DP table by considering two possibilities: either include or exclude the current element.
