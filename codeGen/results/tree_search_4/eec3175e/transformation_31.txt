===BEGIN PLAN===
There is a recursive relationship between smaller instances of the problem, allowing bottom-up dynamic programming to work effectively.

The current total sum modulo m
State: subset of numbers from 0 to i, where i is the current number in the array. Transition relationship:
    - If the current sum is less than or equal to m, consider adding the current number to the subset.
    - If the current sum is greater than m, ignore the current number and move on to the next one.

Apply bottom-up dynamic programming using iteration and memoization

1. Initialize a memo array of size n+1 with all values set to 0
2. For each i from 0 to n:
    - Calculate the current total sum modulo m
    - If the current total sum is less than or equal to m, consider adding the current number to the subset
    - Update the memo array accordingly
