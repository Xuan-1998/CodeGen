===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem, with some overlap in the computation between instances. Memoization would be effective.

DP solution: Define the state expression as dp[i][j] representing whether there is a subset of the first i integers with sum j * m. Base case: dp[0][k] = 1 if k == 0, and 0 otherwise.

To define a 2D array dp of size n x m, where dp[i][j] is True if there exists a subset of the first i integers with sum j * m, and False otherwise. Initialize the first row and column of the table with base cases.

For each cell dp[i][j], consider including the current integer in the subset or not. If the current integer is less than or equal to j * m / m, then include it; otherwise, do not include it. This decision will affect whether the sum of the included integers is divisible by m.

The value of dp[i][j] should be True if including the current integer in the subset results in a sum that is still divisible by m, and False otherwise.

The plan can be improved by using a bottom-up approach to fill the dp table. Start with the base cases and work your way up. This will help avoid redundant computations.

Edge cases: The problem statement guarantees that 1 <= elements in set <= 1000, 1 <= n, m <= 1000. Therefore, there are no edge cases to consider.
