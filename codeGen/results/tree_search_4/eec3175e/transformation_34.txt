===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can design a bottom-up approach that iteratively computes the optimal solution for smaller instances and stores them in an array.

Let dp[i][k] be the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the first i elements divisible by k. Here, i ranges from 1 to n (the length of the input array), and k ranges from 0 to m-1 (since we only care about sums that are divisible by m).

The base case is when i = 0 or k = 0. In this case, dp[i][k] is simply 0.

For i > 0 and k > 0, the recurrence relation would be:

dp[i][k] = min(dp[i-1][k], dp[i-1][k-nums[i-1]%m] + 1)

Here, nums[i-1]%m represents the remainder of the sum when divided by m. If this remainder is equal to k, then we can't make the sum divisible by m, so we set dp[i][k] to infinity.

The final answer would be dp[n][0].

Note that this approach assumes that the input array contains only non-negative integers, as specified in the problem statement.
