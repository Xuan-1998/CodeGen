===BEGIN PLAN===
There is a recursive relationship between smaller instances of the problem, allowing top-down memoization to work effectively.

A subset sum that is divisible by m
State: Given n and m, a subset sum that is divisible by m;
Transition relationship: The problem can be broken down into smaller instances by considering all possible subsets of S with sums that are divisible by m. We can transition from the base case (n = 1) to larger instances by including or excluding elements from the set.

Memoize function calls by storing results in a dictionary. For each recursive call, check if the result is already computed and return it if so.

Base case: When n = 0, there are no more elements to consider; thus, we can directly determine whether there exists a subset whose sum is divisible by m (True for all sets with n = 0).

For the recursive case, consider two subsets:
- A subset S' that includes the current element;
- A subset S'' that excludes the current element.

Transition: If the current element is divisible by m or if the subset S'' also has a sum divisible by m, then we can transition to smaller instances and continue the recursion.
Memoization: Store results in a dictionary for memoized function calls. This way, when we encounter the same problem again during the recursion, we return the precomputed result instead of redoing the computation.

Return 1 if there is a subset with sum divisible by m; otherwise, return 0.
