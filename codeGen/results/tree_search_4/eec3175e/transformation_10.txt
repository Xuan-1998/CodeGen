The problem can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem with some overlap in computation between instances. Memoization would indeed be effective.

DP solution: Define state expression as dp[k][i] representing whether k-th integer can be included in a subset that sums to i * m. Base case: dp[0][j] = 1 if j == 0, and 0 otherwise.
dp[i] represents whether there is a subset with sum i * m, and dp[0] = 1.

Implement bottom-up approach using tabulation, where dp[k][i] is calculated based on values of dp[j][i-j*m] for j < k. Additionally, handle edge cases by initializing dp[0][j] to be 1 if j == 0 (since summing zero integers gives 0), and initializing remaining dp[0][j] to be 0.

To make the solution more efficient, consider sorting the input array in descending order before computation, as larger numbers can contribute more significantly to the total sum.
This ensures that memoization is done effectively, reducing computational time.
