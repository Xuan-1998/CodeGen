===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem, with some overlap in the computation between instances. Memoization would be effective.

DP solution: Define the state expression as dp[i][k] representing whether there is a subset of the first i integers with sum k. Base case: dp[0][j] = 1 if j == 0, and 0 otherwise.

Let dp[i][k] be True if there exists a subset of the first i numbers with sum equal to k % m, and False otherwise.

Use dynamic programming by filling up the dp table in a bottom-up manner. Initialize dp[0][j] for all 0 <= j < m as follows: dp[0][0] = 1, and dp[0][j] = 0 for j != 0. Then for each i from 1 to n-1:

    - For k from 0 to m-1:
        + If there exists a subset of the first i numbers with sum equal to k % m, then set dp[i][k] as True.
        + Otherwise, set dp[i][k] as False.

Finally, return dp[n-1][k] for any k such that 0 <= k < m. This will give us the answer whether there exists a subset of the given integers with sum divisible by m.
