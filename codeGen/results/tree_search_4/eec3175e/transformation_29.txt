===BEGIN PLAN===
There is a recursive relationship between smaller instances of the problem, allowing top-down memoization to work effectively.

State: subset of numbers from 0 to i, where i is the current number in the array. Transition relationship: add the current number to the subset if it's less than or equal to m.
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with a 2D table where each cell represents whether there is a subset of numbers from index 0 to i that sums up to j modulo m.

State initialization: Initialize all cells in the 2D table to False, indicating no such subset exists initially.
Transition rules:
- If the current sum (j) is less than or equal to m, then check if adding the current number (i) to the subset makes a valid solution. If so, set the corresponding cell to True.
- If the current sum (j) is greater than m, then there's no need to consider this subset as it will always be invalid.

Base case: When the current index i is 0 or when j equals 0 modulo m, return True if all numbers are less than or equal to m and False otherwise.
