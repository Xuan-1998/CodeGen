===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem, with some overlap in the computation between instances. Memoization would be effective.

DP solution: Define the state expression as dp[i][j] representing whether there is a subset of the first i integers with sum j * m. Base case: dp[0][k] = 1 if k == 0, and 0 otherwise.

Define dp[i][j] as 1 if there exists a subset of the first i elements whose sum is equal to j * m, and 0 otherwise. For each i > 0, consider including or excluding the i-th element from the subset. If the i-th element's value is less than j * m, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] || (dp[i-1][j-w] && w % m == 0) where w is the i-th element's value.

Use memoization to store intermediate results in a dictionary and look up values as needed, with key-value pairs representing (i, j) pairs. Initialize dp[0][k] = 1 for all k from 0 to m-1.

For each i > 0, iterate over j from 0 to m-1, updating dp[i][j] accordingly. Finally, return dp[n][m-1].
