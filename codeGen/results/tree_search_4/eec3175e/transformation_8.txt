===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem, with some overlap in the computation between instances. Memoization would be effective.

DP solution: Define the state expression as dp[i][k] representing whether there is a subset that sums to i and includes the k-th integer. Base case: dp[0][j] = 1 if j == 0, and 0 otherwise.

dp[][] represents whether there is a subset with sum i * m, for all 0 <= i < m.
Use memoization to store the dynamic programming states in a 2D array dp[][] of size (m+1) x n. Initialize it as an array of zeros.
For each number from 0 to m, check if there is a subset that sums to i * m and includes all numbers up to k. If found, update the state dp[i][k] = 1.

Let's iterate over the elements in the set. For each element, try to include it in the subset summing to i * m. This can be done by checking if there is a subset that sums to (i - nums[j] / m) * m and includes all numbers up to j-1.
If found, update the state dp[i][k] = 1.

The answer would be dp[m][n-1].
