===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a dynamic programming approach with memoization to check for the presence of both substrings
The state expression is the remaining part of the string after processing the current substring. The base case is when the input string is empty or has been fully processed (i.e., no more 'AB' or 'BA' can be found)
Consider the current position in the string as the state, and define a set of possible states based on whether:
	- No 'AB' or 'BA' have been found yet
	- 'AB' has been found but not 'BA'
	- 'BA' has been found but not 'AB'
	- Both 'AB' and 'BA' have been found
Define a recursive function with memoization to store the states that have been processed, to avoid redundant computation
The base case is when the input string is empty or has been fully processed (i.e., no more 'AB' or 'BA' can be found)
The recursive function will check for the presence of either 'AB' or 'BA' in the remaining part of the string, and update the state accordingly
If both 'AB' and 'BA' are found, return "YES", otherwise return "NO"
