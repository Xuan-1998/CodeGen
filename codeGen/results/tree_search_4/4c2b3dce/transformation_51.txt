===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a dynamic programming approach with a sliding window
The state expression is the remaining part of the string after processing the current substring
The base case is when the input string is empty and both substrings "AB" and "BA" have been found
The next state can be either the same as the current state if no 'AB' or 'BA' is found at the current position, 
or it's a new state where the remaining part of the string after processing the current 'A', 'B', or 'a' or 'b' is considered
Initialize a set or list with an empty string and update it iteratively using dynamic programming
For each character in the input string:
    Check if "AB" or "BA" can be formed starting from this position by considering the remaining part of the string
    If not, move to the next character and repeat the process until either a match is found or the end of the string is reached
Update the set or list with the new state
Return 'YES' if both substrings are found in the input string, otherwise return 'NO'
