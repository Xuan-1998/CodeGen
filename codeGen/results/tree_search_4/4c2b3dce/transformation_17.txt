===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if 'AB' and 'BA' are present in the string s
  If i equals 0 (base case):
    Return True if 'AB' is not found, False otherwise
  Else:
    Split the string into two halves: left_half = s[:i] and right_half = s[i:]
    Check if 'AB' appears at least once in either half
      If yes, check if 'BA' does not appear anywhere in the remaining part of the other half
        Return True if 'AB' is found and 'BA' is not found, False otherwise
    Tabulate the results using a dictionary where the keys are indices and values are booleans indicating whether 'AB' or 'BA' is found at that index
      Combine the results from both halves to determine if 'AB' and 'BA' are present in the entire string
