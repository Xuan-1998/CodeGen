===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a sliding window approach to check for the presence of both substrings 'AB' and 'BA'
The state expression is the remaining part of the string after processing the current substring.
The base case is when the input string is empty, in which case we can return "YES" or "NO" depending on whether 'BA' was present in the original string.
Create a dynamic programming table with dimensions equal to the length of the input string minus 1 (since we're sliding the window), where each cell represents the presence or absence of the substring 'AB' at that position.
Fill the table by checking for the presence of 'AB' in the current window and updating the remaining part of the string.
The final answer is determined by checking whether 'BA' can be found in the last remaining part of the string after processing all substrings.
Check if 'BA' is present in the remaining part of the string, and return "YES" if it is, or "NO" otherwise.
