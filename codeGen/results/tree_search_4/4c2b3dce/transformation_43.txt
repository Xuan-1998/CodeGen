===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a sliding window approach to check for the presence of both substrings
The state is a tuple (i, j) where i is the index of the last character seen from 'AB', and j is the index of the last character seen from 'BA'. The base case is when both substrings have been processed.
Maintain two separate dynamic programming arrays dp_ab and dp_ba, with the state representing the presence or absence of each substring up to a given index. 
dp_ab[i] will be True if the substring "AB" can be formed within the first i characters, False otherwise. Similarly for dp_ba.
Use a dictionary results to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computation
The plan is correct in terms of identifying the problem as a string manipulation problem.
However, it could be improved by breaking down the sliding window approach into two separate steps: 
1) Check if "AB" or "BA" appears anywhere in the string. If not, return "NO". 
2) Then check if the remaining part of the string contains the other substring.

The plan does not explicitly handle edge cases such as an empty input string or a string containing only one character.
