===BEGIN PLAN===
Let s[i] be a boolean indicating whether 'AB' or 'BA' is found in the first i characters of s.
Create a 1D DP table where dp[i] indicates whether 'AB' or 'BA' is found in the first i characters of s.
Use a sliding window approach to iterate over the string, checking each substring of length 2 for being 'AB' or 'BA'.
For each substring, check if it's equal to 'AB' or 'BA', and update dp[i] accordingly:
    - If the substring is 'AB', set dp[i] = True
    - If the substring is 'BA', set dp[i] = True
    - If the substring is neither 'AB' nor 'BA', set dp[i] = False
Return "YES" if dp[length(s)] is True, and "NO" otherwise.
