===BEGIN PLAN===
Split the string into two halves and recursively solve for each half, combining the results
Check if 'AB' is found at some index j in the first half; if not, move to the second half
If 'AB' is found at some index j and s[j-1] is False, then we can safely return True because this 'AB' cannot overlap with any potential 'BA'
Store the state transitions in a dictionary where each key is a tuple representing the state (either 'A', 'B', or neither) and each value is a boolean indicating if there's a valid transition from that state
Memoize the results of subproblems as you solve them, so that if the same subproblem appears again, you can just look up the result instead of recomputing it
Combine the results for the two halves to determine if 'AB' and 'BA' are non-overlapping substrings in the original string
