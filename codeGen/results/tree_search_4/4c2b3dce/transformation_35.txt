===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a sliding window approach to check for the presence of both substrings 'AB' and 'BA'
Let the state be whether the current position in the string is at the end of 'AB' or not, and the base case is when we've processed the entire string.
Transition relationship can be determined by checking if the next character matches either 'A' or 'B', and updating the state accordingly
Memoize the results of subproblems by storing them in a dictionary and reusing them when needed
When the state indicates we've processed both substrings, return "YES", otherwise return "NO"
===END PLAN===
