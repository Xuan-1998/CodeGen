===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a sliding window approach to check for the presence of both substrings "AB" and "BA". 
The state expression is the remaining part of the string after processing the current substring. The base case is when the input string is empty.
Consider the current position in the string as the state, and define a set of possible states based on whether the substring 'AB' has been found before this position or not (0/1).
Store previously computed values using a dictionary to avoid redundant computations.
To check if "BA" appears after processing "AB", maintain two variables: one for the remaining part of the string, and another for the state indicating whether 'AB' was found before this point. 
Update these variables based on whether the substring "AB" or "BA" is found at each position in the string.
The final answer will be "YES" if both substrings are present and do not overlap, and "NO" otherwise.
