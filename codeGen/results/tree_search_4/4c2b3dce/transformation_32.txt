===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a sliding window approach to check for the presence of both substrings
Let the state be whether the current position in the string is at the end of 'AB' or not, and the base case is when we've processed the entire string.
State can be an integer indicating the number of 'A's seen so far, and the base case is when we've processed all characters. When we see a 'B', we increment the state by 1; when we see an 'A', we decrement the state by 1. 
Check if the state is equal to 0 at any point in time; this means we have seen both 'AB' and 'BA'. 
Store the indices of such points in a list, then sort it. If the length of the sorted list is 2 or more, return "YES". Otherwise, return "NO".
