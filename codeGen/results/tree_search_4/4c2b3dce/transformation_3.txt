===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if 'AB' appears in the string, then check if 'BA' appears in the remaining part of the string
The state is an integer index i into the string s, with base case being when i >= len(s) - 2 (i.e., there are at most two characters left).
Whether 'BA' appears in the remaining part of the string (i.e., s[i+2:]) as a function of whether 'AB' appears in this part
Create a 1D array dp where dp[i] is True if the substring s[:i] contains both 'AB', and False otherwise.
Initialize dp to be all False
For each i from 0 to len(s) - 3:
    If s[i:i+2] == 'AB' or s[i:i+2] == 'BA':
        dp[i + 1] = True
    For j from i + 2 to len(s):
        if s[j-1:j+1] == 'BA' and dp[j - 2]:
            dp[j] = True
Check if dp[len(s) - 3]
If True, return "YES", otherwise return "NO"
