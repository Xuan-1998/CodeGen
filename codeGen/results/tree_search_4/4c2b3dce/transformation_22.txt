===BEGIN PLAN===
Split the string into two halves and recursively solve for each half, combining the results
Check if 'AB' appears in the first half and 'BA' appears in the second half
If 'AB' is found at some index j and s[j-1] is 'B', then we can safely return True because this 'AB' cannot overlap with any potential 'BA'
Consider the state where the last character processed was either 'A' or 'B', and determine if there's a valid transition to the next character
Use a bottom-up approach by initializing a 2D table with dimensions (n+1) x 2, where n is the length of the string
Fill the table in a bottom-up manner, considering the last two characters processed: 
- If both are 'A', fill the cell with True if 'AB' can be appended to the end; otherwise, False
- If one is 'A' and the other is 'B', fill the cell with True if 'BA' can be appended to the start; otherwise, False
- If both are 'B', fill the cell with True if 'BA' can be prepended to the start; otherwise, False
Use this table to determine if 'AB' or 'BA' appears in the string
Check the last row of the table to see if there's a valid transition from either 'A' or 'B' to the end of the string
If so, return True; otherwise, return False
