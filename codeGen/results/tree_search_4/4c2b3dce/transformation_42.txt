===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a sliding window approach to check for the presence of both substrings
The state is a tuple (i, j) where i is the index of the last character seen from 'AB', and j is the index of the last character seen from 'BA'. The base case is when both substrings have been processed.
Initialize two pointers, one at the start of the string and one at the end of the string. Move the pointers based on the characters encountered in the string.
When the first pointer encounters an 'A', move it to the right until it encounters a 'B'. When the second pointer encounters a 'B', move it to the left until it encounters an 'A'.
Check if the strings "AB" and "BA" are present in the remaining part of the string. If they are, return "YES", otherwise return "NO".
