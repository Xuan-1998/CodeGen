===BEGIN PLAN===
Split the string into two halves and recursively solve for each half, combining the results
If 'AB' is found at some index j and s[j-1] is False, then we can safely return True because this 'AB' cannot overlap with any potential 'BA'.
Consider the state where the last character processed was either 'A' or 'B', and determine if there's a valid transition to the next character.
Memoize the function by defining a recursive function with an additional parameter to store intermediate results, avoiding redundant computation and improving efficiency
Check for edge cases: empty string, strings containing only one character, strings not containing both 'AB' and 'BA'
Recursively check each half of the string for the presence of 'AB' or 'BA', considering valid transitions from 'A' to 'B' or vice versa
Combine the results of the recursive calls to determine if the string contains non-overlapping substrings 'AB' and 'BA'
Return 'YES' if found, 'NO' otherwise
