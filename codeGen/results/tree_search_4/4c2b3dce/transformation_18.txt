===BEGIN PLAN===
Split the string into two halves and recursively solve for each half, combining the results
The base case would be when i equals 0, since there are no more characters to consider
Determine the first occurrence of 'A' and 'B' in the string
Check if there is an 'A' before every 'B' and vice versa
Use a sliding window approach to check for "AB" or "BA" substrings
Maintain two pointers, one at the start of each half
Move the pointers forward until they meet or one of them reaches the end of its respective half
At each step, check if the current substring is "AB" or "BA"
If found, return "YES", otherwise continue moving the pointers
Combine the results from both halves and return the final answer
