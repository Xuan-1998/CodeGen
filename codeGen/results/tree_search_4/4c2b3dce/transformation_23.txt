===BEGIN PLAN===
Split the string into two halves and recursively solve for each half, combining the results
If 'AB' is found at some index j and s[j-1] is False, then we can safely return True because this 'AB' cannot overlap with any potential 'BA'.
Consider a state where the last character processed was either 'A' or 'B', and determine if there's a valid transition to the next character.
If the last character processed was 'A', check if the current character is 'B' or if there's an index i such that s[i:i+2] equals 'BA'.
If the last character processed was 'B', check if the current character is 'A' or if there's an index i such that s[i:i+2] equals 'AB'.
If both checks pass, recursively solve for the remaining part of the string.
Return "YES" when a valid sequence is found; otherwise, return "NO".
