===BEGIN PLAN===
Split the string into two halves and recursively solve for each half, combining the results
The base case would be when i equals 0, since there are no more characters to consider.

Check if 'AB' appears at least once in the string. If yes, then check if 'BA' does not appear anywhere in the remaining part of the string.
Combine the results from both recursive calls and return it

===END PLAN===
