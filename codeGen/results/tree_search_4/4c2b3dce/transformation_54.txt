===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization to determine if the given string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' substrings.

Let dp[i] represent whether the substring from index 0 to i can be split into two non-overlapping substrings "AB" and "BA".

The state transition equation is:
dp[i] = (s[i-2:i] == "AB" && dp[i-2]) || (s[i-1] == 'B' && s[i] == 'A' && dp[i-2])

The base case is when i is 0, in which case dp[0] is True.

The final answer is determined by checking whether dp[len(s)-2] is True.
