===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if 'AB' appears in the string, then check if 'BA' appears in the remaining part of the string
The state is an integer index i into the string s, with base case being when i >= len(s) - 2 (i.e., there are at most two characters left).
Whether 'AB' appears in the string s up to index i
Use a boolean array dp where dp[i] = True if 'AB' or 'BA' has been seen so far
dp[0] = False
for i from 1 to len(s) - 2:
    dp[i] = (s[i-1:i+1] == 'AB' or s[i-1:i+1] == 'BA') and not dp[i-1]
return "YES" if dp[len(s)-2] else "NO"
