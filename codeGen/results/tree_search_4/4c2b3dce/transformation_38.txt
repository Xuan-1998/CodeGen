===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a sliding window approach with two pointers i and j, where i is the index of the last character seen from 'AB' and j is the index of the last character seen from 'BA'.
Initialize a flag found_ab and found_ba to False.
Iterate over the string s:
    If the substring "AB" appears at the current position i, set found_ab to True and update i to be one more than the end of the substring "AB".
    If the substring "BA" appears at the current position j, set found_ba to True and update j to be one more than the end of the substring "BA".
    If both substrings have been found (found_ab and found_ba are True), return "YES". Otherwise, continue iterating.
Return "NO" if neither substring is found after processing the entire string.
Apply memoization to cache intermediate results and improve performance
