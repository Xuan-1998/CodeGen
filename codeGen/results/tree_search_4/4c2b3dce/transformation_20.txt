===BEGIN PLAN===
Split the string into two halves and recursively solve for each half, combining the results
The base case would be when i equals 0, since there are no more characters to consider.

Instead of splitting the string and using recursion, we can use a single loop to iterate over the string. This is more efficient because it avoids the overhead of function calls.

Determine the first occurrence of 'A' and 'B' in the string. Then check if there is an 'A' before every 'B' and vice versa.
This step is unnecessary, as we only need to check if "AB" and "BA" appear together in the string. We can use a single loop to do this.

Implement tabulation by using a 2D array to store the results of subproblems, and then backtracking to construct the solution
We don't need dynamic programming or backtracking for this problem. A simple loop can suffice.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
