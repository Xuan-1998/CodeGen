===BEGIN PLAN===
Split the string into two halves and recursively solve for each half, combining the results
  * This approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for the overlap between 'AB' and 'BA'
If 'AB' is found at some index j and s[j-1] is False, then we can safely return True because this 'AB' cannot overlap with any potential 'BA'.
  * This condition is correct but it should be applied after checking for 'BA' in the remaining part of the string
Use a dictionary to store the state transitions, where each key is a tuple representing the state and each value is a boolean indicating if there's a valid transition from that state
  * This approach can be used to optimize the solution but it should be used after tabulation
Implement tabulation by initializing a table with all False values, and then update the table based on certain conditions to mark whether 'AB' or 'BA' can be found in the first j characters and the remaining m-j characters, where j is from 0 to len(s)
  * This approach is correct but it should be used to pre-compute the information needed for the state transitions
