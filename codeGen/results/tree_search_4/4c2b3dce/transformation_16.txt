===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if 'AB' appears at least once in the string. If yes, then check if 'BA' does not appear anywhere in the remaining part of the string.
If the length of the string is less than 2, return "YES" (since there's no way to find 'AB' or 'BA')
Split the string into two halves and recursively solve for each half
Memoize the recursive function calls by storing previously computed results in a dictionary
Return "NO" if either 'AB' or 'BA' appears at least once
===END PLAN===
