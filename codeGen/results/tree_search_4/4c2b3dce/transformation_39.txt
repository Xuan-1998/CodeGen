===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a sliding window approach with two pointers (i, j) where i is the index of the last character seen from 'AB', and j is the index of the last character seen from 'BA'. 
The base case is when both substrings have been processed.
Keep track of two pointers for 'AB' and 'BA', updating the states as we move along the string. 
We can use a 2D table dp[i][j] to store whether the current state matches 'AB' or 'BA'.
Initially, set all dp[i][j] values to False.

1. If both substrings have been processed (i >= len('AB') and j >= len('BA')), return True.
2. Otherwise, check if the current character matches either substring:
   a. If it's an 'A', update i and j accordingly for 'AB' and 'BA'.
   b. If it's a 'B', swap i and j.
3. Fill up the table dp[i][j] with intermediate results as we move along the string.
4. Reuse previously computed values in the table to avoid redundant computations.
