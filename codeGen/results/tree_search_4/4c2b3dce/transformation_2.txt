===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if 'AB' appears in the string, then check if 'BA' appears in the remaining part of the string
The state is an integer index i into the string s, with base case being when i >= len(s) - 2 (i.e., there are at most two characters left).
Whether 'AB' or 'BA' appears in the string s up to index i
Use a set to store the characters in the current window

    if 'AB' in s[:i]:
        if 'BA' in s[i:]:
            return "YES"
    elif 'BA' in s[:i]:
        if 'AB' in s[i:]:
            return "YES"

    return "NO"
