===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming and memoization to solve this problem.

Let dp[i][j] be the number of ways to form sum j using the first i elements of the array.

1. Initialize dp with zeros: dp = [[0 for _ in range(N+1)] for _ in range(m+1)]

2. Iterate over the elements of the array:
    - For each element, iterate from N to the current element.
    - For each sum from 0 to N, calculate the number of ways to form it by adding the current element and previous sums.
    - Store this information in dp[i][j].

3. Initialize a dictionary ways with zeros: ways = {i: 0 for i in range(N+1)}

4. Iterate over the array again:
    - For each element, iterate from N to the current element.
    - For each sum from 0 to N, calculate the number of ways to form it by adding the current element and previous sums.
    - Store this information in ways.

5. The answer is the number of ways to form 'N'.
