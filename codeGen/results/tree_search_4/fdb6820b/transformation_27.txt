===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the state expression as dp[i] = total number of combinations to form 'i' using elements from the array.

Base case: 0 <= i < N when the base case value is 1 because there's only one way to form 0, namely by not adding any numbers.

dp[i] = sum(dp[j] for j in range(i)) * (i == 0 or 1)

Define a dynamic programming table dp of size N+1 and fill it using the recurrence relation. 

Initialization: Set dp[0] = 1 as there's one way to form 0.

Fill the table: For each i from 1 to N, calculate dp[i] as the sum of all combinations that can be formed by adding an element from the array to a combination that forms i-1. This is because any combination that forms i-1 can be extended to form i by adding one more number.

The formula for calculating dp[i] would be: 

dp[i] = (sum(dp[j] for j in range(i)) * 1) + (dp[i-1] * m)

Here, the first term is summing up all combinations that can be formed by adding an element from the array to a combination that forms i-1. The second term is considering all combinations that form i-1 and can be extended to form i.

The base case dp[0] = 1 ensures that there's only one way to form 0.

Return dp[N]

This plan correctly solves the problem.
