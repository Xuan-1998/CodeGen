Let's break down your plan step by step:

1. **Memoization**: You're on the right track! Using memoization can indeed help us solve this problem more efficiently.

2. **Recursive function**: Your idea is sound, but we need to be careful not to get stuck in an infinite recursion or run out of memory for large inputs.

3. **State definition**: Your dp[i][j] state makes sense. It represents the number of ways to form sum i using exactly j positive integers from the array.

4. **Base cases**: You correctly identified that dp[0][0] = 1 (since there's only one way to form a sum of 0), and dp[0][k] = 0 for k > 0 (since we can't form any non-zero sum with zero elements).

5. **Memoization using a dictionary**: This is where things get interesting! Instead of using a traditional dynamic programming approach, we can store the intermediate results in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

Here's an updated version of your plan:
