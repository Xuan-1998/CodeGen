===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider dynamic programming where each subproblem is defined as a tuple (N, i) representing the remaining value N and the index i in the array. The optimal substructure can be identified by realizing that the problem of finding ways to form N with the first i elements of the array is similar to the original problem but with reduced size.

State: (N, i) represents the remaining value N and the index i in the array. Base case: when N is 0, there's only one way to form it (by not including any elements).

Transition Relationship: F(N, i) = Sum(F(n, j), for all j from 0 to i-1, where n is the sum of array elements up to index j). The key insight here is that we can combine ways to form N with different subsets of the first i elements and subtract the corresponding value from N.

Use a two-dimensional array dp with size (N+1) x (m+1) to store the dynamic programming state. Initialize dp[0][i] = 1 for all i, since there's only one way to form 0 with any subset of the first i elements.

Fill up the dp table by iterating over N from 1 to N and i from 1 to m: dp[N][i] = Sum(dp[n][j], where n is the sum of array elements up to index j, for all j from 0 to i-1).

Finally, return dp[N][m].
