===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider dynamic programming where each subproblem is defined as a tuple (N, i) representing the remaining value N and the index i in the array. The optimal substructure can be identified by realizing that the problem of finding ways to form N with the first i elements of the array is similar to the original problem but with reduced size.

State: dp[N][i] represents the number of ways to form N using the first i elements of the array. Base case: when N is 0, there's only one way to form it (by not including any elements).

Transition Relationship: dp[N][i] = sum(dp[n][j], for all j from 0 to i-1) where n is the sum of array elements up to index j.

Implement a function to recursively solve the problem, using a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations. Initialize an empty dictionary dp and update it in each recursive call. The base case should be when N becomes 0.
