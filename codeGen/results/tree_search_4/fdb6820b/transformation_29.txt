===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i] = total number of combinations to form 'i' using elements from the array
base case: 0 <= i < N when the base case value is i + 1 because there's only one way to form each integer less than or equal to N, namely by simply adding up all numbers below it.

dp[i] = sum(dp[j] for j in range(i)) * (i == 0 or 1)
Use a loop to fill the dynamic programming table dp by iterating over all possible values of N from 1 to N
for i in range(1, N+1):
    if i < m:
        dp[i] = 1
    else:
        for j in range(i):
            dp[i] += dp[j]
        if i > 0: 
            dp[i] %= 10**9 + 7
