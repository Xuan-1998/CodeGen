===BEGIN PLAN===
Treat this as a dynamic programming problem and use a 2D array dp initialized with zeros. Iterate over the elements of the array to fill up the dp table.

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][i-k-1] for k in range(i)) if i <= j else 0

Maintain a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to form sum 'N-j' using the first 'i' elements of the array.

Iterate over each element in the array, and for each element calculate the total number of ways to form sums from 1 to N-j by adding the current element. This can be done by iterating over all previous elements and calculating the number of ways to add them up to get a sum less than or equal to N-j.

Implement memoization by defining a recursive function that uses a dictionary or cache to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
