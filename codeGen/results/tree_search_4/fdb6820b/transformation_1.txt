===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider dynamic programming where each subproblem is defined as a tuple (N, i) representing the remaining value N and the index i in the array. The optimal substructure can be identified by realizing that the problem of finding ways to form N with the first i elements of the array is similar to the original problem but with reduced size.

State: (N, i) represents the remaining value N and the index i in the array. Base case: when N is 0, there's only one way to form it (by not including any elements).

Transition Relationship: F(N, i) = Sum(F(n, j), for all j from 0 to i-1, where n is the sum of array elements up to index j).

Employ a dictionary called memo to store and retrieve the results of subproblems.

Base case optimization: Instead of recalculating the base case (N=0) for each subproblem, precompute this value once at the beginning. This can significantly speed up computation.

Memoization optimization: To avoid redundant calculations, use memoization to store intermediate results. Initialize memo with default values and update it as you compute F(N, i).

Improved Transition Relationship: Instead of recalculating F(n, j) for each n and j in the transition relationship, store these values in memo once they are computed. This can reduce computation time.

Edge case handling: Ensure that your plan handles edge cases correctly, such as N being less than the sum of all array elements or greater than their maximum value.
