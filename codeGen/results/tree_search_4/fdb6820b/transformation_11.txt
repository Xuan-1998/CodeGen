===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider dynamic programming where each subproblem is defined as a tuple (N, i) representing the remaining value N and the index i in the array. The optimal substructure can be identified by realizing that the problem of finding ways to form N with the first i elements of the array is similar to the original problem but with reduced size.

State: dp[(N, i)] = min(1 + dp[(N - arr[i], i)], 1 + dp[(N - arr[i], i-1)]), represents the minimum number of ways to form N by including or excluding the ith element. Base case: when N is 0, there's only one way to form it (by not including any elements).

Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where you fill up the dp array in order of increasing 'N'. Start with dp[(0, i)] = 1 for all i and then iteratively update dp[(N, i)] based on its dependencies.

The plan correctly identifies the optimal substructure and considers the base case. It also includes a bottom-up approach to fill up the dp array, which is suitable for this problem.

To improve the plan, you can consider memoization to avoid redundant calculations and optimize the time complexity. Additionally, you should handle edge cases such as when N is less than the smallest element in the array or when i exceeds the array size.
