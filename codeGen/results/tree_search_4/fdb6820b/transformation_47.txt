===BEGIN PLAN===
Treat this as a counting problem and use dynamic programming by initializing a 2D array dp with zeros, where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to form sum 'N-j' using the first 'i' elements of the array.

Initialize dp[0][0] = 1 (base case: there is exactly one way to form sum 0 using no elements)

Iterate over the elements of the array:
    for i from 1 to m:
        iterate over j from i to N:
            if j < i, then dp[i][j] = 0 (no ways to form sum 'N-j' using less than 'i' elements)
            else dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][i-k-1] for k in range(i)) (number of ways to form sum 'N-j' by adding the current element and using the first 'i-1' elements)

Return dp[m][N] (the number of ways to form sum N)
