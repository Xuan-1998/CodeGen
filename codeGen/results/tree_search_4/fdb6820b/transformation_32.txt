===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i] = total number of combinations to form 'i' using elements from the array
state transition: dp[i] = 1 + sum(dp[j] for j in range(i)) where j is the element being used to form 'i'
base case: i == N, return 1 (only one way to form N)
base case: 0 <= i < N, return 1 (one way to form 0 by not adding any numbers)

Memoization: store intermediate results in a dictionary dp and update it recursively
Return the final answer once all possible combinations have been considered

Example:
    if i == N: 
        return 1
    elif 0 <= i < N:
        return 1
    else:
        total = 0
        for j in range(m):
            if elements[j] <= i:
                total += dp[i - elements[j]]
        return total

Note: The base case should be when 'i' is less than or equal to the maximum possible sum of array elements, which is N * m. This is because there can't be more ways to form a number greater than this.
