===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about using memoization where a recursive function is used to find the number of ways to form N and the function calls itself with smaller values of N until it reaches base cases.

Define the state expression as dp[i] = total number of combinations to form 'i' using elements from the array, and base case as 0 <= i < N when the base case value is 1 because there's only one way to form 0, namely by not adding any numbers.

dp[i] = sum(dp[k-1] for k in range(i+1)) if i > 0 else dp[0]
Update dp dictionary with intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations by checking if the result for a given sum is already computed before computing it anew. This way, you can optimize your code and reduce its complexity.
