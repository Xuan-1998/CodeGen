===BEGIN PLAN===
Treat this as a counting problem and use tabulation where a 2D array dp is initialized with zeros, and then iterate over the elements of the array to fill up the dp table.
dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][i-k-1] for k in range(i)) if i <= j else 0
Use memoization to store the intermediate results and avoid repeated computations.
Initialize a variable res with 0, which will store the total count of ways to form N.
Iterate over the elements of the array. For each element, iterate from i = N down to the current element. 
If dp[i][j] is greater than 0, then update res by adding dp[i][j].
Finally, return res modulo 10^9+7.
