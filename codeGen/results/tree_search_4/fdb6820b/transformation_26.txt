===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the state expression as dp[i] = total number of combinations to form 'i' using elements from the array. Set base cases: 0 <= i < N when the base case value is 1 because there's only one way to form 0, namely by not adding any numbers.
dp[0] = 1 (base case)
For i in range(N+1):
    if i < N:
        dp[i] = sum(dp[max(0, i-nums[j])] for j in range(m))
    else:
        dp[i] = 0
Return dp[N]
