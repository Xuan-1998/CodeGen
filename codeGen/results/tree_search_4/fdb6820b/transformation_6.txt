===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider dynamic programming where each subproblem is defined as a tuple (N, i) representing the remaining value N and the index i in the array. The optimal substructure can be identified by realizing that the problem of finding ways to form N with the first i elements of the array is similar to the original problem but with reduced size.

State: dp[N][i] represents the number of ways to form N using the first i elements.
Base case: when i is 0 or N is less than 0, return 0. This base case ensures that we do not attempt to form a negative number or an empty set which would be invalid.

dp[N][i] = 2*sum(dp[N-k][j] for j in range(i)) + (N in set(array[:i+1]))
This recursive formula considers two cases: 
    1. The remaining value N can be obtained by adding the current element to a subset formed using the previous elements (represented by sum(dp[N-k][j] for j in range(i))). This case is multiplied by 2 because we are considering all possible subsets that include or do not include the current element.
    2. The current element itself contributes to forming the target number N, so we add 1 if N is present in the set of elements from index 0 to i.

Use a memoization function with recursion and a dictionary to store intermediate results
This approach ensures that subproblems are solved only once, reducing the overall time complexity.
