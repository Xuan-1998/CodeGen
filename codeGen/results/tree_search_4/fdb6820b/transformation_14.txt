===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider dynamic programming where each subproblem is defined as a tuple (N, i) representing the remaining value N and the index i in the array. The optimal substructure can be identified by realizing that the problem of finding ways to form N with the first i elements of the array is similar to the original problem but with reduced size.

State: (N, i) = (num_ways_to_form_N_minus_i, num_elements_included), represents the remaining value and the number of elements included in forming N. Base case: when N is 0, there's only one way to form it (by not including any elements).

dp[n][i] = (dp[n-i][1] + dp[n][i-1], i), represents the remaining value after subtracting the i-th element from n, and i is the index of the last element used

Use a 2D table to store the dynamic programming state where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to form j using the first i elements.

For edge cases:
- If N > sum of array elements, return 0 because it's not possible to form N
- If N is less than or equal to sum of array elements, start filling up the dynamic programming table from top-right (N = sum, i = m) and move left and down
