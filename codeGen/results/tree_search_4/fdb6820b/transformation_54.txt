===BEGIN PLAN===
Treat this as a counting problem and use dynamic programming where a 2D array dp is initialized with zeros. Iterate over the elements of the array to fill up the dp table.

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][i-k-1] for k in range(i)) if i <= j else 0

Calculate the total sum of the array and determine if it's less than or equal to N.
If true, calculate the number of combinations using a recursive function.

Develop a dynamic programming solution using a bottom-up approach where you define a recursive function and modify it to store intermediate results in a lookup table.

Use memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

Iterate over the array elements from smallest to largest. For each element, update the dp table based on previously calculated values.

Calculate the total number of combinations by summing up the values in the last row of the dp table.

Finally, return the result modulo 10^9+7.
