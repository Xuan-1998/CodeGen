===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider dynamic programming where each subproblem is defined as a tuple (N, i) representing the remaining value N and the index i in the array. The optimal substructure can be identified by realizing that the problem of finding ways to form N with the first i elements of the array is similar to the original problem but with reduced size.
State: dp[N][i] represents the number of ways to form N using the first i elements. Base case: when i is 0 or N is less than 0, return 0.

dp[N][i] = 2*sum(dp[N-k][j] for j in range(i)) + (N in set(array[:i+1]))
Use a bottom-up approach to initialize and update the dynamic programming table, initializing dp[0][i] to 1 (since there's only one way to form 0) and dp[n][i] to 0 for n > N.
For each i from 0 to m-1:
    Initialize dp[N][i] = 0
    For each k in array[:i+1]:
        Update dp[N-k][j] for j in range(i)
    Return dp[N][m-1]
