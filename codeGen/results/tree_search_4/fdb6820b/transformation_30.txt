===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with memoization where a recursive function is used to find the number of ways to form N and the function calls itself with smaller values of N until it reaches base cases.

Define the state expression as dp[i] = total number of combinations to form 'i' using elements from the array, and base case as 0 <= i < N when the base case value is 1 because there's only one way to form 0, namely by not adding any numbers.

dp[i] = sum(dp[i-1]) for all numbers in the array that are less than or equal to i (this represents the number of combinations to form 'i' using the current element and previous combinations)

Initialize an array dp with size N+1 and fill it up in a loop, considering the number of ways to form each sum from 0 to N.

Return dp[N] as the total number of combinations to form N.
