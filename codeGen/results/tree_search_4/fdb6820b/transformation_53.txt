===BEGIN PLAN===
Treat this as a counting problem and use tabulation where a 2D array dp is initialized with zeros, and then iterate over the elements of the array to fill up the dp table.
dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][i-k-1] for k in range(i)) if i <= j else 0
This approach seems incorrect because it tries to count the number of ways to form N by adding elements from the array. However, the problem statement does not mention that we are allowed to use each element only once.
Instead, let's think about this problem as a problem of choosing r numbers out of m (where r is equal to N) and calculate the number of combinations using recursion with memoization.
Implement memoization by defining a helper function that takes an additional argument to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.
Store the total sum of the array in a variable, let's call it 'total_sum'.
Determine if the total_sum is less than or equal to N, and then calculate the number of combinations using recursion.
