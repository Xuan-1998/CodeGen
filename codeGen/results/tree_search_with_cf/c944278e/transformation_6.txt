1. Define the state dp[i][mask] as the set of possible maximum values achievable after processing the first i bits of the binary string s, given the bitmask mask.
2. Initialize the base case: For i = 0, dp[0][mask] is initialized to the values directly determined by the initial elements in the sequence as per the bitmask. Specifically, dp[0][mask] = {mask + 1}, since the sequence initially contains all integers from 1 to 2^n.
3. Transition: For each bit i in the string s, update dp[i][mask] based on the previous state dp[i-1][mask']:
   - If the bit is 0, dp[i][mask] is derived from the smaller values of the pairs in dp[i-1][mask'].
   - If the bit is 1, dp[i][mask] is derived from the larger values of the pairs in dp[i-1][mask'].
4. Iterate through each bit of the binary string s and update the dp table accordingly:
   - For each mask, determine the pairs of elements based on the current bit.
   - Update the dp table by comparing the pairs and keeping the appropriate values (smaller or larger) based on the current bit.
5. After processing all bits, the set of possible maximum values is given by dp[n][0], where n is the length of the binary string.
6. Output the possible maximum values in ascending order.
