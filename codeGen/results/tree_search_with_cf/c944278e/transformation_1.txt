1. Top-down approach with memoization:
   - This approach involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations.
   - Time complexity: O(2^n * n), space complexity: O(2^n * n).

   State Expression:
   - Let dp[i][mask] represent the set of possible maximum values after processing the first i bits of the string s, where mask is a bitmask representing the selected elements in the sequence p.

   Base Case:
   - dp[0][mask] = {values corresponding to the initial elements selected by the mask}.

   Transition:
   - For each bit i in the string s:
     - If s[i] is 0, then dp[i+1][new_mask] = min(dp[i][mask]) for the pairs considered.
     - If s[i] is 1, then dp[i+1][new_mask] = max(dp[i][mask]) for the pairs considered.

2. Bottom-up approach with tabulation:
   - This approach iteratively builds up the solution from the base cases using a table to store intermediate results.
   - Time complexity: O(2^n * n), space complexity: O(2^n * n).

   State Expression:
   - Let dp[i][mask] represent the set of possible maximum values after processing the first i bits of the string s, where mask is a bitmask representing the selected elements in the sequence p.

   Base Case:
   - dp[0][mask] = {values corresponding to the initial elements selected by the mask}.

   Transition:
   - For each bit i in the string s:
     - If s[i] is 0, then dp[i+1][new_mask] = min(dp[i][mask]) for the pairs considered.
     - If s[i] is 1, then dp[i+1][new_mask] = max(dp[i][mask]) for the pairs considered.
