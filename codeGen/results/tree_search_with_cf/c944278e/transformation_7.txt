1. Define a function to generate the initial sequence of integers from 1 to 2^n.
2. Initialize a memoization table dp where dp[i][mask] represents the set of possible maximum values after processing the first i bits of the binary string s, given the bitmask mask.
3. Base Case: For i = 0, initialize dp[0][mask] to the values directly determined by the initial elements in the sequence as per the bitmask.
4. For each bit i in the binary string s:
   a. If s[i] is '0', update dp[i][mask] by taking the minimum of each pair of elements from dp[i-1][mask].
   b. If s[i] is '1', update dp[i][mask] by taking the maximum of each pair of elements from dp[i-1][mask].
5. Iterate through all possible masks (subsets of elements) and update the dp table accordingly.
6. After processing all bits, collect the possible maximum values from the dp table.
7. Return the collected maximum values in ascending order as the final result.
