===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
1. State: Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum possible value in the sequence after the first i phases, considering the j-th pair of elements.
2. Transition: For each phase i and each pair j:
   - If s[i] is '0', then dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][2j], dp[i-1][2j+1]).
   - If s[i] is '1', then dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][2j], dp[i-1][2j+1]).
3. Base case: For the base case, dp[0][j] = j + 1 for all j in the range [0, 2^n - 1], because each element in the initial sequence p is just the integer from 1 to 2^n.
4. Iterate through all phases from 1 to n, updating the dp table according to the transition rules.
5. After processing all phases, the possible maximum values will be stored in dp[n][0] to dp[n][2^(n-1) - 1].
6. Collect all unique values from the final phase and sort them in ascending order.
7. Output the sorted list of unique maximum values.
