1. Define the state expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the set of possible values that can be obtained from the subarray of length 2^i starting at index j. The final answer will be found in dp[n][0].

2. Initialize the base case: For i = 0, each dp[0][j] will contain the single element {j+1}, since each subarray of length 2^0 (which is 1) starting at index j is simply the element j+1.

3. Iterate from i = 1 to n (inclusive) to fill the DP table:
   a. For each i, iterate over all possible starting indices j of subarrays of length 2^i (from 0 to 2^n - 2^i).
   b. For each j, determine the subarray of length 2^i starting at index j.
   c. Divide this subarray into two halves of length 2^(i-1):
      - The first half starts at index j.
      - The second half starts at index j + 2^(i-1).
   d. Depending on the i-th bit of the binary string s (0-based index):
      - If s[i-1] is '0', take the union of the sets from the first half and the second half, and keep the smaller elements.
      - If s[i-1] is '1', take the union of the sets from the first half and the second half, and keep the larger elements.
   e. Store the resulting set in dp[i][j].

4. The final answer will be the sorted list of elements in dp[n][0].
