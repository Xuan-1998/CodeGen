1. Initialize a 2D list dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum value obtainable at the i-th phase, considering the j-th subset of elements. The dimensions of dp will be (n + 1) x (2^n).
2. Base case: For the base case, set dp[0][j] = j + 1 for all j in the range [0, 2^n - 1], because each element in the initial sequence p is just the integer from 1 to 2^n.
3. Transition: Iterate through each phase i from 1 to n, and for each subset j from 0 to 2^(n-i) - 1:
   a. If s[i-1] is '0', set dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][2j], dp[i-1][2j+1]).
   b. If s[i-1] is '1', set dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][2j], dp[i-1][2j+1]).
4. After filling the dp table, the possible maximum values are stored in the last phase dp[n][0].
5. Extract the possible maximum values from dp[n][0] and sort them in ascending order.
6. Output the sorted list of possible maximum values.
