1. Define the state expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum possible value that can be obtained from the subarray of length 2^i starting at index j. The final answer will be found in dp[n][0].

2. Initialize the dp array: Create a 2D array dp with dimensions (n+1) x (2^n). Initialize dp[0][j] = j+1 for all j from 0 to 2^n - 1, as the initial sequence is the permutation of integers from 1 to 2^n.

3. Transition relationship: For each i from 0 to n-1 and each j from 0 to 2^(n-i-1)-1:
   - If s[i] == '0', then dp[i+1][j] = min(dp[i][2j], dp[i][2j+1])
   - If s[i] == '1', then dp[i+1][j] = max(dp[i][2j], dp[i][2j+1])

4. Determine the final result: The final result will be the unique values found in dp[n][0].

5. Output the result: Output the unique values in ascending order.

Time complexity: O(2^n * n)
Space complexity: O(2^n * n)
