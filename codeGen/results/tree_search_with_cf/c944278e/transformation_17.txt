1. State: Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum possible value in the sequence after the first i phases, considering the j-th pair of elements. Transition: For each phase i and each pair j, if s[i] is '0', then dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][2j], dp[i-1][2j+1]), else if s[i] is '1', then dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][2j], dp[i-1][2j+1]).
2. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This approach involves solving the problem iteratively from the smallest subproblems up to the original problem, storing the results in a table. Time complexity: O(2^n * n), space complexity: O(2^n * n).
3. Base case: For the base case, dp[0][j] = j + 1 for all j in the range [0, 2^n - 1], because each element in the initial sequence p is just the integer from 1 to 2^n.
4. Transition: For each phase i and each pair j, if s[i] is '0', then dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][2j], dp[i-1][2j+1]), else if s[i] is '1', then dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][2j], dp[i-1][2j+1]).
5. Result: The final result will be the sorted list of all possible values in dp[n][0] after the last phase.
