1. Base case: Initialize dp[0][j] = j + 1 for all j in the range [0, 2^n - 1], because each element in the initial sequence p is just the integer from 1 to 2^n.
2. State: Define dp[i][j] as the maximum value obtainable at the i-th phase, considering the j-th subset of elements.
3. Transition: 
   - If s[i] is '0', dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][2j], dp[i-1][2j+1]).
   - If s[i] is '1', dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][2j], dp[i-1][2j+1]).
4. Iterate through all phases from 1 to n, updating the dp table according to the transition rules.
5. After processing all phases, the possible maximum values will be found in dp[n-1][0] to dp[n-1][2^(n-1)-1].
6. Collect these values, remove duplicates, and sort them in ascending order.
7. Output the sorted list of unique possible maximum values.
