1. Initialize the sequence p: Start with the sequence p as the integers from 1 to 2^n in ascending order.

2. State Definition: Define dp[i][mask] as the set of possible maximum values achievable after processing the first i bits of the binary string s, given the bitmask mask. The bitmask represents the indices of the elements in the sequence p that are still considered in the current phase.

3. Base Case: For i = 0, dp[0][mask] is initialized to the values directly determined by the initial elements in the sequence as per the bitmask. Essentially, dp[0][mask] = {p[j] | j is in mask}.

4. Transition: For each bit i in the string s:
   - If the bit is 0, dp[i][mask] is derived from the smaller values of the pairs in dp[i-1][mask'].
   - If the bit is 1, dp[i][mask] is derived from the larger values of the pairs in dp[i-1][mask'].
   - Specifically, for each valid mask, split the elements into pairs, and based on the bit value, keep either the smaller or larger element of each pair.

5. Memoization: Store the results of subproblems in the dp array to avoid redundant computations. Use a dictionary or list of sets to store the possible maximum values for each state.

6. Result Extraction: After processing all bits, the final result will be the set of possible maximum values in dp[n][final_mask], where final_mask represents the indices of the elements that survived all phases (which should be just one element).

7. Output: Convert the set of possible maximum values to a sorted list and output it.
