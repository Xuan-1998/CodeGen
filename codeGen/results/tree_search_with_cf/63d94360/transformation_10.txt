1. Define the problem as a dynamic programming problem with a 2D array dp where dp[n][i] represents the number of ways to pass the ball exactly n times such that the i-th player has the ball at the end.
2. Initialize the base case: dp[0][0] = 1. This signifies that with 0 passes, the only way for the 0-th player to have the ball is the initial state. For all other players, dp[0][j] = 0 for j > 0, since no passes have been made yet.
3. Define the state transition: For each pass from 1 to N, and for each player from 0 to K, calculate dp[n][i] as the sum of dp[n-1][j] for all j != i. This means that the number of ways to end up with the ball at player i after n passes is the sum of all the ways to end up with the ball at any other player j after n-1 passes.
4. Use a nested loop to fill the dp table based on the state transition defined. Iterate over the number of passes from 1 to N, and for each pass, iterate over each player from 0 to K. For each player, sum the number of ways to reach all other players in the previous pass.
5. To handle large numbers, take the result modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7) at each step of the calculation to avoid overflow and ensure the result fits within standard integer limits.
6. After filling the dp table, the result for each test case is found in dp[N][P], where P is the player who should receive the ball last (in this problem, P is always player 0).
7. Read the input values for T, N, and K. For each test case, use the above steps to compute and print the result.
