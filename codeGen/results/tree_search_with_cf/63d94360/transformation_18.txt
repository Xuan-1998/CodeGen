1. Initialize a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to pass the ball `i` times such that player `j` has the ball at the end of the `i-th` pass.
2. Base Case: Initialize `dp[0][0] = 1` because if no passes are made, the ball is with player `P` (index 0).
3. Transition Relationship: For each pass `i` from 1 to `N`, and for each player `j` from 0 to `K`:
   a. Calculate `dp[i][j]` as the sum of all `dp[i-1][m]` for all players `m` where `m` is not equal to `j`.
4. Use modulo `1000000007` to keep the values manageable and to meet the problem's requirements.
5. The final answer for each test case is `dp[N][0]`, which represents the number of ways to pass the ball `N` times such that player `P` (index 0) has the ball at the end.
6. Iterate through all test cases and apply the above steps to compute the results.
