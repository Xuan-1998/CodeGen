1. Define the state expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of ways to make exactly i passes such that the j-th player receives the ball on the i-th pass.

2. Base case: Initialize dp[0][P] = 1, as there is one way to start with player P having the ball without any passes.

3. Transition: For each pass i from 1 to N, and for each player j from 1 to K+1, update dp[i][j] based on the previous state:
   dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][m]) for all m != j
   This means that the number of ways to reach player j on the i-th pass is the sum of the ways to reach any other player on the (i-1)-th pass.

4. Final result: The number of ways to pass the ball exactly N times such that player P receives the ball last is dp[N][P].

5. Implement the solution using a top-down approach with memoization to store results of subproblems, preventing redundant calculations.

6. Handle multiple test cases by iterating through each test case and computing the result using the above steps.

7. Return the result modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7) for each test case.

8. Ensure that the solution handles edge cases such as the minimum and maximum values of N and K, and that it efficiently computes the result within the given constraints.
