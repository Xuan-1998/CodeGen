1. Define the state expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of ways to pass the ball exactly i times such that player j has the ball at the end of the i-th pass.

2. Initialize the base case: At the 0th pass, only player P has the ball.
   - dp[0][P] = 1
   - dp[0][j] = 0 for all j ≠ P

3. Transition relationship: For each pass count i from 1 to N and each player j from 0 to K (excluding j = P), update the dp table.
   - dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][m]) for all m ≠ j, where m ranges from 0 to K.

4. Ensure the final pass is made to player P:
   - The result for each test case will be dp[N][P].

5. Compute the result for each test case modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7).

6. Iterate through the test cases, apply the above steps, and output the results.

Time complexity: O(N*K^2)
Space complexity: O(N*K)
