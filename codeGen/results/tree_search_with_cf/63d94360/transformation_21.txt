1. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This approach builds a table in a bottom-up manner, iteratively solving subproblems and storing the results in a table. It avoids recursion overhead and is typically easier to implement iteratively. Time complexity: O(N*K), space complexity: O(N*K).

2. State Expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of ways to pass the ball i times such that player j has the ball at the end of the i-th pass.

3. Transition Relationship: dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][m]) for all m ≠ j, with the base case being dp[0][P] = 1 and dp[0][j] = 0 for all j ≠ P.

4. Initialization: Create a 2D list dp where dp[0][P] = 1 and dp[0][j] = 0 for all j ≠ P.

5. Iteration: Iterate from i = 1 to N and for each i, iterate through each player j. Update dp[i][j] based on the transition relationship.

6. Result Extraction: The final result for each test case will be dp[N][P] % 1000000007.

7. Edge Cases: Consider edge cases such as the minimum and maximum values for N and K, and ensure the modulo operation is applied to handle large numbers.
