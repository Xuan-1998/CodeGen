1. Define the problem using a dynamic programming approach with a bottom-up strategy and tabulation. This approach builds a table iteratively and stores the results to avoid recursion overhead.
2. State Definition: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of ways to pass the ball exactly i times such that player j has the ball at the end of the i-th pass.
3. Base Case: Initialize dp[0][P] = 1, where P is the player who should receive the ball last. For all other players j ≠ P, initialize dp[0][j] = 0.
4. Transition Relationship: For each pass i from 1 to N, and for each player j from 0 to K (excluding the player who currently has the ball):
   - dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][m]) for all m ≠ j.
5. Iteratively compute the values of dp[i][j] from i = 1 to N and j = 0 to K using the transition relationship.
6. The final result for each test case is dp[N][P], which gives the number of ways to pass the ball exactly N times such that player P receives the ball last.
7. Return the result modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7) for each test case.
