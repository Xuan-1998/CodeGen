1. Understand the Problem:
   - We need to transform the initial sequence into the final sequence using a series of operations.
   - An operation consists of selecting an integer from the sequence that is strictly greater than an adjacent integer, removing the smaller integer, and adding its value to the larger integer.
   - The task is to determine if such a sequence of operations exists and, if it does, to provide one possible sequence of operations.

2. Key Observations:
   - The sum of the elements in the final sequence must equal the sum of the elements in the initial sequence for a valid transformation.
   - The order of elements in the final sequence matters, and we can only combine elements in the initial sequence in a way that respects this order.

3. Plan:
   1. Check if the sum of the initial sequence equals the sum of the final sequence. If not, print "NO" and exit.
   2. Use a greedy approach to simulate the operations:
      - Start with the initial sequence and try to match the elements of the final sequence.
      - For each element in the final sequence, find a contiguous subarray in the initial sequence that sums to that element.
      - If such a subarray is found, simulate the operations needed to combine those elements.
      - If it's not possible to find such subarrays for all elements in the final sequence, print "NO" and exit.
   3. Output the sequence of operations if the transformation is possible.

4. Detailed Steps:
   1. Initialize an empty list to store the operations.
   2. Iterate through each element in the final sequence:
      - For each element, find the smallest contiguous subarray in the initial sequence that sums to this element.
      - If found, simulate the operations needed to combine the elements in this subarray to form the element.
      - Record each operation in the list.
      - Update the initial sequence by replacing the subarray with the single element.
   3. If all elements in the final sequence are matched, print "YES" and the list of operations. Otherwise, print "NO".
