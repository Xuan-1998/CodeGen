1. State Expression: Let dp[i][j] be a boolean value where dp[i][j] is True if the first i elements of the initial sequence can be transformed into the first j elements of the final sequence, otherwise False. Base Case: dp[0][0] = True, because an empty initial sequence can be transformed into an empty final sequence.

2. Transition: For each element in the initial sequence, we check if it can be combined with its adjacent element to form the next element in the final sequence. Specifically, for each valid pair (i, j) where dp[i][j] is True:
    - If a[i] > a[i+1], then we can combine a[i] and a[i+1] to form a new value a[i] + a[i+1] and update dp[i+1][j+1] accordingly.
    - If a[i+1] > a[i], then we can combine a[i+1] and a[i] to form a new value a[i+1] + a[i] and update dp[i+1][j+1] accordingly.

3. Base Case: Initialize dp[0][0] = True, because an empty initial sequence can be transformed into an empty final sequence.

4. Fill the DP Table: Iterate through the initial sequence and fill the dp table based on the transition rules.

5. Check Final State: After filling the dp table, check the value of dp[n][k]. If it is True, then there exists a sequence of operations that can transform the initial sequence into the final sequence. Otherwise, it is not possible.

6. Construct the Sequence of Operations: If dp[n][k] is True, backtrack through the dp table to construct the sequence of operations that transforms the initial sequence into the final sequence.

7. Edge Cases:
    - If n = 1 and k = 1, the initial sequence should be equal to the final sequence.
    - If k > n, it is impossible to transform the initial sequence into the final sequence.
    - If the sum of the initial sequence does not match the sum of the final sequence, it is impossible to transform the initial sequence into the final sequence.
