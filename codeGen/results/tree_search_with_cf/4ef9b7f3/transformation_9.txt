1. Understand the Problem: We need to determine if we can transform the initial sequence into the final sequence using a series of operations. Each operation involves selecting an integer from the sequence that is strictly greater than an adjacent integer, removing the smaller integer, and adding its value to the larger integer.

2. Key Observations:
   - The length of the sequence decreases by one with each operation.
   - The sum of elements in the sequence remains the same after each operation.
   - The final sequence must be a valid transformation of the initial sequence.

3. Plan:
   - Use a greedy approach to simulate the transformation process.
   - Iterate through the initial sequence and try to match the elements with the final sequence.
   - At each step, check if the current element in the initial sequence can be transformed to match the corresponding element in the final sequence.
   - If it can, perform the necessary operations and move to the next element in the final sequence.
   - If it cannot, check if the transformation is possible by considering the adjacent elements.

4. Steps:
   1. Initialize variables to keep track of the current index in the initial sequence (`i`) and the final sequence (`j`).
   2. Iterate through the initial sequence:
      - If the current element matches the corresponding element in the final sequence, move to the next element in the final sequence.
      - If the current element is greater than the corresponding element in the final sequence, try to reduce it by combining it with adjacent elements.
      - If the current element is less than the corresponding element in the final sequence, check if the transformation is possible by combining it with adjacent elements.
   3. If we successfully match all elements in the final sequence, print "YES" and the sequence of operations.
   4. If not, print "NO".

5. Edge Cases:
   - If the initial sequence is already equal to the final sequence.
   - If the length of the initial sequence is 1.
   - If the length of the final sequence is 1.
   - If the sum of the initial sequence does not match the sum of the final sequence.
