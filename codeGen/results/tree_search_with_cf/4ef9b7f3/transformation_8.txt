1. Problem Understanding: We need to determine if we can transform the initial sequence into the final sequence through a series of operations. Each operation consists of selecting an integer from the sequence that is strictly greater than an adjacent integer, removing the smaller integer, and adding its value to the larger integer.

2. Dynamic Programming Approach:
   - Let dp[i][j] represent whether it's possible to transform the first i elements of the initial sequence into the first j elements of the final sequence.
   - Base Case: dp[0][0] = True, because no operations are needed to transform an empty initial sequence into an empty final sequence.
   - State Transition: 
     - If the element a[i] in the initial sequence is equal to b[j] in the final sequence, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1].
     - Otherwise, explore combining current and next elements in the initial sequence to match the current element in the final sequence.
   - We need to ensure that the sum of the elements in the initial sequence matches the sum of the elements in the final sequence.

3. Implementation Steps:
   - Calculate the sum of the initial sequence and the final sequence. If they do not match, print "NO".
   - Use a dynamic programming table to keep track of possible transformations.
   - Iterate through the initial sequence and attempt to match it with the final sequence using the allowed operations.
   - If we can successfully transform the initial sequence into the final sequence, print "YES" and the sequence of operations. Otherwise, print "NO".

4. Edge Cases:
   - If n = k, check if the sequences are identical.
   - If the sum of the initial sequence does not equal the sum of the final sequence, it's impossible to transform.
   - Handle cases where elements are already in the desired position without any operations.

5. Completeness:
   - Ensure the solution covers all possible scenarios and edge cases.
   - The dynamic programming approach should efficiently handle the constraints given (n â‰¤ 500).
