1. Define the state: Let dp[i][j] be a boolean that indicates whether the initial subsequence of length i can be transformed into the final subsequence of length j.
2. Initialize the DP table: Create a 2D table dp of size (n+1) x (k+1), where dp[0][0] is True (an empty initial sequence can be transformed into an empty final sequence).
3. Base Cases: Set dp[i][0] to True for all i (any initial subsequence can be transformed into an empty final sequence by removing all elements).
4. Transition: For each i from 1 to n and each j from 1 to k:
   - If a[i-1] == b[j-1], set dp[i][j] to dp[i-1][j-1] (match the current element of both sequences).
   - If a[i-1] > b[j-1], set dp[i][j] to dp[i-1][j-1] (remove the smaller element and add its value to the larger element).
   - If dp[i-1][j] is True, set dp[i][j] to True (skip the current element in the initial sequence).
5. Final Check: The answer will be dp[n][k], which tells us if the entire initial sequence can be transformed into the entire final sequence.
6. Reconstruct the sequence of operations: If dp[n][k] is True, backtrack from dp[n][k] to reconstruct the sequence of operations that transforms the initial sequence into the final sequence.
7. Output the result: If dp[n][k] is True, print "YES" and the sequence of operations. Otherwise, print "NO".
