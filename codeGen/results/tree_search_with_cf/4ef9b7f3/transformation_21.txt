2. Bottom-Up Strategy with Tabulation: This approach involves solving the problem iteratively by building up a table from the smallest subproblems to the largest. It uses a 2D table where each entry represents whether a certain subsequence can be transformed into another. Time complexity: O(n*k), space complexity: O(n*k).
1. Define the state: Let dp[i][j] be a boolean that indicates whether the initial subsequence of length i can be transformed into the final subsequence of length j.
3. Initialization: dp[0][0] is true because an empty initial sequence can be transformed into an empty final sequence.
4. Transition: For each pair (i, j), check if the current element in the initial sequence can be merged with its adjacent element to match the current element in the final sequence. Update dp[i][j] based on whether the merge operation results in the required value in the final sequence.
5. Final Check: After filling up the dp table, check the value of dp[n][k]. If it is true, print "YES" and reconstruct the sequence of operations. Otherwise, print "NO".
6. Reconstructing the sequence of operations: If dp[n][k] is true, backtrack through the dp table to find the sequence of operations that led to the transformation. This involves tracing back the decisions made during the transition step.
