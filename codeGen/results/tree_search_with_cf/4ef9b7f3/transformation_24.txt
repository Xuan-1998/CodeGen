1. Define the state: Let dp[i][j] be a boolean that indicates whether the initial subsequence of length i can be transformed into the final subsequence of length j.
2. Initialize the DP table: 
   - dp[0][0] = True, since an empty initial subsequence can be transformed into an empty final subsequence.
   - dp[i][0] = False for all i > 0, since a non-empty initial subsequence cannot be transformed into an empty final subsequence.
   - dp[0][j] = False for all j > 0, since an empty initial subsequence cannot be transformed into a non-empty final subsequence.
3. Transition: To fill dp[i][j], consider possible operations that can transform the initial subsequence of length i into the final subsequence of length j:
   - If a[i-1] == b[j-1], then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1], as the last element matches and we can consider the subsequences without the last element.
   - Additionally, for each valid operation, update dp[i][j] based on whether it can be transformed by removing elements and adding their values to adjacent elements.
4. Final Check: The answer will be dp[n][k], which tells us if the entire initial sequence can be transformed into the entire final sequence.
5. Backtracking to find the sequence of operations: If dp[n][k] is True, backtrack through the DP table to find the sequence of operations that led to the transformation.
6. Edge Cases:
   - If n == k, directly compare the initial and final sequences.
   - If any element in the final sequence is greater than the sum of all elements in the initial sequence, print "NO".
