1. State: Let dp[i][j] be True if the first i elements of the initial sequence can be transformed into the first j elements of the final sequence. Otherwise, dp[i][j] is False.
2. Base case: dp[0][0] = True, since an empty initial sequence can be transformed into an empty final sequence. For all other dp[i][0] where i > 0, dp[i][0] = False, since a non-empty initial sequence cannot be transformed into an empty final sequence. Similarly, for all dp[0][j] where j > 0, dp[0][j] = False, since an empty initial sequence cannot be transformed into a non-empty final sequence.
3. Transition: For each pair (i, j), if dp[i][j] is True, we need to check if we can merge two adjacent elements to form the next element in the final sequence. Specifically:
   - If a[i-1] + a[i-2] == b[j-1], then dp[i][j] = dp[i-2][j-1]
   - If a[i-1] + a[i] == b[j-1], then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
   - If a[i] + a[i+1] == b[j-1], then dp[i+1][j] = dp[i][j-1]
4. Iterate through the table and fill it based on the transition rules.
5. After filling the table, check the value of dp[n][k]. If it is True, print "YES" and reconstruct the sequence of operations. Otherwise, print "NO".
6. To reconstruct the sequence of operations, trace back from dp[n][k] to dp[0][0] and record the operations performed at each step.
