1. Define the state: Let dp[i][j] be a boolean that indicates whether the initial subsequence of length i can be transformed into the final subsequence of length j.
2. Bottom-Up Strategy with Tabulation: This approach involves solving the problem iteratively by building up a table from the smallest subproblems to the largest. It uses a 2D table where each entry represents whether a certain subsequence can be transformed into another. Time complexity: O(n*k), space complexity: O(n*k).
3. Initialization: dp[0][0] is true because an empty initial sequence can be transformed into an empty final sequence.
4. Transition: For each element in the initial sequence (i from 1 to n) and each element in the final sequence (j from 1 to k):
   - If dp[i-1][j] is true and the i-th element of the initial sequence can be merged with the (i-1)-th element to form the j-th element of the final sequence, set dp[i][j] to true.
   - If dp[i][j-1] is true and the i-th element of the initial sequence can be merged with the (i+1)-th element to form the j-th element of the final sequence, set dp[i][j] to true.
5. Check the final state: If dp[n][k] is true, it means the initial sequence can be transformed into the final sequence. Otherwise, it cannot be transformed.
6. If transformation is possible, reconstruct the sequence of operations by backtracking from dp[n][k] to dp[0][0] and keep track of the operations performed.
7. Output "YES" followed by the sequence of operations if the transformation is possible. Otherwise, output "NO".
