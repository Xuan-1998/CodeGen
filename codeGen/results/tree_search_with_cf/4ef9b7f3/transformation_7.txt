1. Problem Understanding:
   - We need to transform the initial sequence into the final sequence using a series of operations.
   - An operation involves selecting an integer from the sequence that is strictly greater than an adjacent integer, removing the smaller integer, and adding its value to the larger integer.
   - We need to determine if it's possible to transform the initial sequence into the final sequence and, if so, provide one possible sequence of operations.

2. Plan:
   - Use a greedy approach combined with a simulation of operations to transform the initial sequence into the final sequence.
   - Check if the sum of the initial sequence equals the sum of the final sequence. If not, print "NO".
   - Use a two-pointer technique to simulate the transformation:
     - Maintain two pointers, i for the initial sequence and j for the final sequence.
     - Traverse the initial sequence and try to form the elements of the final sequence by combining adjacent elements.
     - If the current element of the initial sequence matches the current element of the final sequence, move both pointers forward.
     - If the current element of the initial sequence is less than the current element of the final sequence, combine the current element with the next one to try to match the required value.
     - If it's not possible to match the required value, print "NO".
   - If the transformation is successful, print "YES" and the sequence of operations.

3. Detailed Steps:
   - Step 1: Check if the sum of the initial sequence equals the sum of the final sequence. If not, print "NO".
   - Step 2: Initialize two pointers, i = 0 and j = 0, to traverse the initial and final sequences.
   - Step 3: Initialize an empty list to store the operations.
   - Step 4: While i < n and j < k:
     - If a[i] == b[j], move both pointers forward.
     - If a[i] < b[j], try to combine a[i] with the next element a[i+1]:
       - If a[i] + a[i+1] <= b[j], perform the operation and update the list of operations.
       - If a[i] + a[i+1] > b[j], print "NO" and exit.
     - If a[i] > b[j], print "NO" and exit.
   - Step 5: If j == k and i == n, print "YES" and the sequence of operations. Otherwise, print "NO".

4. Edge Cases:
   - The initial sequence has only one element.
   - The final sequence has only one element.
   - The initial sequence cannot be transformed into the final sequence due to mismatched sums.
   - Multiple ways to transform the initial sequence into the final sequence.
