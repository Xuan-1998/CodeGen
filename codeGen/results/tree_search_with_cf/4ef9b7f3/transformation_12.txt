1. Define the problem as a sequence transformation problem where we need to transform the initial sequence into the final sequence using specific operations.
2. Use a Dynamic Programming (DP) approach to solve the problem efficiently.
3. Define a DP table where dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to transform the first i elements of the initial sequence into the first j elements of the final sequence.
4. Initialize the DP table:
   - dp[0][0] = True, because no operations are needed to transform an empty initial sequence into an empty final sequence.
   - dp[i][0] = False for all i > 0, because we cannot transform a non-empty initial sequence into an empty final sequence.
   - dp[0][j] = False for all j > 0, because we cannot transform an empty initial sequence into a non-empty final sequence.
5. Iterate through the DP table and fill it based on the following conditions:
   - If dp[i-1][j-1] is True and a[i-1] == b[j-1], then dp[i][j] = True.
   - If dp[i-1][j] is True and there exists an adjacent pair (a[i-2], a[i-1]) such that a[i-2] > a[i-1], then we can perform an operation to merge these two elements and form a new element a'[i-2] = a[i-2] + a[i-1]. Use this to update dp table accordingly.
6. Check the value of dp[n][k] to determine if it's possible to transform the entire initial sequence into the final sequence.
7. If dp[n][k] is True, reconstruct the sequence of operations by tracing back through the DP table.
8. Output the result:
   - If dp[n][k] is False, print "NO".
   - If dp[n][k] is True, print "YES" followed by the sequence of operations.
