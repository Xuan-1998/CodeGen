1. Bottom-Up Strategy with Tabulation: This approach involves solving the problem iteratively by building up a table from the smallest subproblems to the largest. It uses a 2D table where each entry represents whether a certain subsequence can be transformed into another. Time complexity: O(n*k), space complexity: O(n*k).

2. Initialize the DP table:
   - Create a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is True if the first `i` elements of the initial sequence can be transformed into the first `j` elements of the final sequence.
   - Base case: `dp[0][0] = True`, since an empty initial sequence can be transformed into an empty final sequence. For all other `dp[i][0]` where `i > 0`, `dp[i][0] = False`, since a non-empty initial sequence cannot be transformed into an empty final sequence. Similarly, for all `dp[0][j]` where `j > 0`, `dp[0][j] = False`, since an empty initial sequence cannot be transformed into a non-empty final sequence.

3. Transition: For each pair `(i, j)`:
   - If `dp[i-1][j-1]` is True and the `i`-th element of the initial sequence is equal to the `j`-th element of the final sequence, then `dp[i][j] = True`.
   - If there exists an element in the initial sequence before the `i`-th element which can be combined with the `i`-th element to form the `j`-th element of the final sequence, then `dp[i][j] = True`.

4. Memoization: This approach involves using a recursive function with memoization to store the results of subproblems. Time complexity: O(n*k), space complexity: O(n*k).

5. Construct the sequence of operations:
   - If `dp[n][k]` is True, backtrack through the DP table to construct the sequence of operations that transforms the initial sequence into the final sequence.
   - If `dp[n][k]` is False, output "NO".

6. Edge cases:
   - Handle cases where `n = 1` or `k = 1`.
   - Handle cases where elements in the initial sequence are all the same.
   - Handle cases where the final sequence contains elements that are much larger than any element in the initial sequence.
