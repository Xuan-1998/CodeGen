1. Define the state: Let dp[i][j] be a boolean that indicates whether the initial subsequence of length i can be transformed into the final subsequence of length j.
2. Initialize the dp table: Create a 2D table dp of size (n+1) x (k+1) and set all values to False. Set dp[0][0] to True, as an empty initial subsequence can be transformed into an empty final subsequence.
3. Transition Relationship: Iterate through the dp table. For each dp[i][j] that is True, consider all valid operations that can be performed on the subsequence of length i resulting in a subsequence of length i-1. If the resulting subsequence matches the first j elements of the final sequence, update dp[i-1][j] to True.
4. Check if transformation is possible: After filling the dp table, check the value of dp[n][k]. If it is True, print "YES" and reconstruct the sequence of operations. Otherwise, print "NO".
5. Reconstruct the sequence of operations: If dp[n][k] is True, backtrack through the dp table to find the sequence of operations that transforms the initial sequence into the final sequence. Store the operations in a list and print them.
