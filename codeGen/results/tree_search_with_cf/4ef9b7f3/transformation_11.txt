1. Define the problem in terms of subproblems:
   - Let dp[i][j] represent whether it is possible to transform the first i elements of the initial sequence into the first j elements of the final sequence.

2. Base Case:
   - dp[0][0] = True, because no operations are needed to transform an empty initial sequence into an empty final sequence.
   - dp[i][0] = False for all i > 0, because we cannot transform a non-empty initial sequence into an empty final sequence.
   - dp[0][j] = False for all j > 0, because we cannot transform an empty initial sequence into a non-empty final sequence.

3. State Transition:
   - For each i from 1 to n and each j from 1 to k:
     - If the current element of the initial sequence matches the current element of the final sequence (a[i-1] == b[j-1]), inherit the result from the previous subproblem: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1].
     - If there exists any l (1 â‰¤ l < i) such that a[l] > a[l+1], we can perform an operation to combine a[l] and a[l+1] into a new element a'[l] = a[l] + a[l+1]. Update dp table accordingly.

4. Final Check:
   - If dp[n][k] is True, then it is possible to transform the initial sequence into the final sequence. Otherwise, it is not possible.

5. Construct the Sequence of Operations:
   - If dp[n][k] is True, backtrack from dp[n][k] to find the sequence of operations that led to the transformation.
   - Keep track of the operations performed and their positions.

6. Edge Cases:
   - If n == k and the initial sequence is already equal to the final sequence, no operations are needed.
   - If k > n, it is impossible to transform the initial sequence into the final sequence.
   - If the sum of elements in the initial sequence does not match the sum of elements in the final sequence, it is impossible to transform.

Time Complexity: O(n^2 * k), because for each dp[i][j], we potentially check all previous elements.
Space Complexity: O(n * k), for storing the dp table.
