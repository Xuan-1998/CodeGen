1. Define the Problem:
   - We need to determine if we can transform the initial sequence of integers into the final sequence using a series of operations.
   - Each operation consists of selecting an integer from the sequence that is strictly greater than an adjacent integer, removing the smaller integer, and adding its value to the larger integer.

2. State Representation:
   - Use a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents whether it's possible to transform the first `i` elements of the initial sequence into the first `j` elements of the final sequence.

3. Base Case:
   - `dp[0][0] = True`: No operations are needed to transform an empty initial sequence into an empty final sequence.
   - `dp[i][0] = False` for all `i > 0`: Non-empty initial sequence cannot be transformed into an empty final sequence.
   - `dp[0][j] = False` for all `j > 0`: Empty initial sequence cannot be transformed into a non-empty final sequence.

4. State Transition:
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n` and each `j` from 1 to `k`:
     - If `a[i-1] == b[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.
     - If `a[i-1] > a[i-2]` and `a[i-1] + a[i-2] == b[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-2][j-1]`.

5. Final Output:
   - If `dp[n][k]` is True, print "YES" and reconstruct the sequence of operations.
   - If `dp[n][k]` is False, print "NO".

6. Reconstructing the Sequence of Operations:
   - If `dp[n][k]` is True, backtrack through the DP table to find the sequence of operations that led to the transformation.
   - For each operation, determine the position `x` and whether it involves the integer to the left ('L') or the right ('R').

7. Edge Cases:
   - Initial sequence and final sequence are identical.
   - Initial sequence has more elements than the final sequence, but they cannot be combined to form the final sequence.
   - Initial sequence elements are all the same, but the final sequence has different elements.

8. Complexity:
   - Time complexity: O(n*k), where `n` is the length of the initial sequence and `k` is the length of the final sequence.
   - Space complexity: O(n*k) for the DP table.
