1. Define State: Let dp[i][j] be a boolean that indicates whether the initial subsequence of length i can be transformed into the final subsequence of length j.
2. Initialize Base Cases: dp[0][0] = True (an empty initial sequence can be transformed into an empty final sequence). All other dp[i][0] and dp[0][j] should be False.
3. Transition: Iterate over the initial sequence (i) and the final sequence (j). For each dp[i][j], check if it's possible to achieve the transformation:
   - If a[i-1] == b[j-1], then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1].
   - If a[i-1] can be combined with an adjacent element to match b[j-1], update dp[i][j] accordingly.
4. Final Check: The answer will be dp[n][k], which tells us if the entire initial sequence can be transformed into the entire final sequence.
5. Reconstruction: If dp[n][k] is True, reconstruct the sequence of operations by backtracking through the dp table. Track the operations performed and output them.
