2. Bottom-Up Strategy with Tabulation: This approach involves solving the problem iteratively by building up a table from the smallest subproblems to the largest. It uses a 2D table where each entry represents whether a certain subsequence can be transformed into another. Time complexity: O(n*k), space complexity: O(n*k).
2. Base case: dp[0][0] = True, since an empty initial sequence can be transformed into an empty final sequence. For all other dp[i][0] where i > 0, dp[i][0] = False, since a non-empty initial sequence cannot be transformed into an empty final sequence. Similarly, for all dp[0][j] where j > 0, dp[0][j] = False, since an empty initial sequence cannot be transformed into a non-empty final sequence.
2. Transition: For each pair (i, j), dp[i][j] = True if any of the following conditions hold: (a) dp[i-1][j] is True and the i-th element of the initial sequence is equal to the j-th element of the final sequence, or (b) there exists an element in the initial sequence before the i-th element which can be combined with the i-th element to form the j-th element of the final sequence.
1. Tabulation: This approach involves using a 2D table where each entry dp[i][j] represents whether the initial subsequence up to i can be transformed into the final subsequence up to j. Time complexity: O(n*k), space complexity: O(n*k).
