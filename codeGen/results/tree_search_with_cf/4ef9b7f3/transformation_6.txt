1. Problem Understanding:
   - We need to transform the initial sequence into the final sequence using a specific set of operations.
   - An operation consists of selecting an integer from the sequence that is strictly greater than an adjacent integer, removing the smaller integer, and adding its value to the larger integer.

2. Approach:
   - Use a greedy approach to simulate the operations step by step.
   - Iterate through the initial sequence and attempt to match it to the final sequence by performing valid operations.

3. Detailed Steps:
   1. Initialize a pointer for the initial sequence (i) and a pointer for the final sequence (j).
   2. Check if the sum of the initial sequence matches the sum of the final sequence. If not, output "NO" and terminate.
   3. While traversing the initial sequence:
      a. If the current element in the initial sequence matches the current element in the final sequence, move both pointers (i and j) forward.
      b. If the current element in the initial sequence is greater than the next element, perform a 'L' operation (merge the next element into the current element) and record the operation.
      c. If the current element in the initial sequence is less than the next element, perform a 'R' operation (merge the current element into the next element) and record the operation.
      d. If neither operation is possible and the elements do not match, output "NO" and terminate.
   4. Continue until the initial sequence is transformed into the final sequence.
   5. Output "YES" followed by the sequence of operations.

4. Edge Cases:
   - If the initial sequence is already equal to the final sequence.
   - If it's impossible to transform the initial sequence into the final sequence due to mismatched sums or invalid operations.

5. Complexity:
   - Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the initial sequence. Each element is processed at most once.
   - Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the sequence of operations.
