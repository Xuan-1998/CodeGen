1. Define the state: Let dp[i][j] be a boolean that indicates whether the initial subsequence of length i can be transformed into the final subsequence of length j.
2. Initialization:
    - dp[0][0] is true because an empty initial sequence can be transformed into an empty final sequence.
    - For any j > 0, dp[0][j] is false because an empty initial sequence cannot be transformed into a non-empty final sequence.
    - For any i > 0, dp[i][0] is false because a non-empty initial sequence cannot be transformed into an empty final sequence.
3. Transition:
    - For each i from 1 to n and each j from 1 to k:
        - If dp[i-1][j] is true and a[i-1] can be merged with its adjacent element to form b[j-1], then dp[i][j] is true.
        - If dp[i][j-1] is true and a[i-1] can be merged with its adjacent element to form b[j-1], then dp[i][j] is true.
4. Final Check:
    - If dp[n][k] is true, print "YES" and reconstruct the sequence of operations.
    - Otherwise, print "NO".
5. Reconstruction of operations:
    - Start from dp[n][k] and backtrack to find the sequence of operations that led to this state.
    - For each dp[i][j] that is true, determine if it came from dp[i-1][j] or dp[i][j-1] and record the corresponding operation.
