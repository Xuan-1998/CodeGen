1. Top-Down Approach with Memoization:
   - This approach involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations. It uses recursion and a memoization table to store results.
   - State Expression: Let dp[i][j] be a boolean value where dp[i][j] is True if the first i elements of the initial sequence can be transformed into the first j elements of the final sequence, otherwise False.
   - Base Case: dp[0][0] = True, because an empty initial sequence can be transformed into an empty final sequence.

2. Transition Relationship:
   - For each dp[i][j], check the possible operations that can transform the first i elements to the first j elements.
   - Specifically, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] if merging a_i with a_{i-1} forms b_j, or dp[i+1][j-1] if merging a_i with a_{i+1} forms b_j.
   - If a_i can be merged with a_{i-1} or a_{i+1} to form b_j, then update dp[i][j] based on the previous states.

3. Bottom-Up Approach with Tabulation:
   - This approach builds the solution iteratively from the base case, filling up a table to store the results of subproblems.
   - Initialize a table dp with dimensions (n+1) x (k+1) where dp[i][j] indicates whether the first i elements of the initial sequence can be transformed into the first j elements of the final sequence.
   - Fill the table using the transition relationships defined above.
   - Time complexity: O(n*k), space complexity: O(n*k).

4. Extracting the Sequence of Operations:
   - If dp[n][k] is True, backtrack through the table to extract the sequence of operations that transforms the initial sequence into the final sequence.
   - Start from dp[n][k] and trace back to dp[0][0], recording the operations performed at each step.
   - Output the sequence of operations in the required format.

5. Edge Cases:
   - If n == k and the initial sequence is the same as the final sequence, the answer is "YES" with no operations.
   - If n < k, it's impossible to transform the initial sequence into the final sequence, so the answer is "NO".
   - If the sum of the initial sequence is not equal to the sum of the final sequence, the answer is "NO".
