1. Define the state: Let dp[i][j] be a boolean that indicates whether the initial subsequence of length i can be transformed into the final subsequence of length j.
2. Initialize the dp table: dp[0][0] should be true because an empty initial sequence can be transformed into an empty final sequence. All other dp[i][0] should be false for i > 0 since a non-empty initial sequence cannot be transformed into an empty final sequence.
3. Transition Relationship: If dp[i][j] is true, then for each valid operation that can be performed on the subsequence of length i resulting in a subsequence of length i-1, we update dp[i-1][j] to true if the resulting subsequence matches the first j elements of the final sequence.
4. Iterate through the dp table: For each i from 1 to n and for each j from 1 to k, check if dp[i][j] can be updated based on the previous states and the valid operations.
5. Check the final state: If dp[n][k] is true, then it is possible to transform the initial sequence into the final sequence. Otherwise, it is not possible.
6. Traceback to find the sequence of operations: If dp[n][k] is true, trace back from dp[n][k] to dp[0][0] to find the sequence of operations that transforms the initial sequence into the final sequence.
7. Output the result: If dp[n][k] is true, print "YES" followed by the sequence of operations. Otherwise, print "NO".
