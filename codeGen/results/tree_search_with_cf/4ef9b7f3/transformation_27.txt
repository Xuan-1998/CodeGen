1. State: Let dp[i][j] be True if the first i elements of the initial sequence can be transformed into the first j elements of the final sequence. Otherwise, dp[i][j] is False.
2. Base case: dp[0][0] = True, since an empty initial sequence can be transformed into an empty final sequence. For all other dp[i][0] where i > 0, dp[i][0] = False, since a non-empty initial sequence cannot be transformed into an empty final sequence. Similarly, for all dp[0][j] where j > 0, dp[0][j] = False, since an empty initial sequence cannot be transformed into a non-empty final sequence.
3. Transition: For each pair (i, j), where 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ j ≤ k:
   - Check if there exists an operation that can transform the first i elements of the initial sequence into the first j elements of the final sequence.
   - Specifically, if the sum of the first i elements of the initial sequence equals the sum of the first j elements of the final sequence, then dp[i][j] = True.
   - Additionally, ensure the sequence of operations is valid by checking if adjacent elements can be merged correctly.
4. Construct the solution: If dp[n][k] is True, reconstruct the sequence of operations by backtracking through the dp table. Otherwise, print "NO".
5. Edge cases:
   - If n = k, check if the initial sequence is already equal to the final sequence.
   - If the sum of the initial sequence does not match the sum of the final sequence, print "NO".
6. Output: If a valid sequence of operations exists, print "YES" followed by the sequence of operations. Otherwise, print "NO".
