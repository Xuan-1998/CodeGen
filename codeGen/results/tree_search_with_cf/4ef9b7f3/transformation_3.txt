1. Define a Dynamic Programming (DP) table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is a boolean value indicating whether the first `i` elements of the initial sequence can be transformed into the first `j` elements of the final sequence.

2. Initialize the DP table:
   - `dp[0][0] = True` because an empty initial sequence can be transformed into an empty final sequence.
   - For all other `dp[i][0]` and `dp[0][j]` where `i > 0` or `j > 0`, set to `False` initially.

3. Iterate through the initial sequence and the final sequence to fill the DP table based on possible operations:
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n` (length of the initial sequence):
     - For each `j` from 1 to `k` (length of the final sequence):
       - Check if `dp[i-1][j-1]` is `True` and if merging `a[i-1]` with `a[i]` or `a[i+1]` forms `b[j-1]`. If so, set `dp[i][j]` to `True`.
       - Specifically:
         - If `i > 1` and `a[i-1] + a[i] == b[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-2][j-1]`.
         - If `i < n` and `a[i] + a[i+1] == b[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.

4. After filling the DP table, check the value of `dp[n][k]`:
   - If `dp[n][k]` is `True`, print "YES" and reconstruct the sequence of operations from the DP table.
   - If `dp[n][k]` is `False`, print "NO".

5. To reconstruct the sequence of operations:
   - Start from `dp[n][k]` and trace back to `dp[0][0]` to find the operations performed.
   - For each `dp[i][j]` that is `True`, determine if the operation was merging `a[i-1]` with `a[i]` or `a[i]` with `a[i+1]` and record the operation accordingly.

6. Edge Cases:
   - If `n == k`, check if the initial sequence is already equal to the final sequence.
   - If `k == 1`, check if the sum of the initial sequence equals the single element in the final sequence.
   - Handle cases where merging is not possible due to sequence constraints.
