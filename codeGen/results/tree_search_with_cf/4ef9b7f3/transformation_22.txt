1. Define the state: Let dp[i][j] be a boolean that indicates whether the initial subsequence of length i can be transformed into the final subsequence of length j.
2. Initialize the table: Set dp[0][0] to True, as an empty initial sequence can be transformed into an empty final sequence. Set all other dp[i][0] to False for i > 0, as a non-empty initial sequence cannot be transformed into an empty final sequence.
3. Fill the table: Iterate over each possible length of the initial sequence (i from 1 to n) and each possible length of the final sequence (j from 1 to k):
   - If dp[i-1][j-1] is True and the sum of the elements in the initial subsequence from index i-1 to the end equals the sum of the elements in the final subsequence from index j-1 to the end, set dp[i][j] to True.
   - Otherwise, if dp[i-1][j] is True and the sum of the elements in the initial subsequence from index i-1 to the end equals the sum of the elements in the final subsequence from index j to the end, set dp[i][j] to True.
4. Final Check: The answer will be dp[n][k], which tells us if the entire initial sequence can be transformed into the entire final sequence.
5. Traceback to find the sequence of operations: If dp[n][k] is True, trace back from dp[n][k] to dp[0][0] to find the sequence of operations that transformed the initial sequence into the final sequence. Record each operation in the format "x L" or "x R", where x is the position of the integer in the current sequence that performs the operation.
