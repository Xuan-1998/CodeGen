1. Define the Problem: The task is to find the maximum possible value of the remaining element after performing the operations on the array until only one element remains.

2. Approach: Use a greedy strategy to solve this problem instead of dynamic programming. The key observation is that to maximize the remaining element, we should always try to remove the smallest adjacent element whenever possible.

3. Steps:
   1. Initialize a variable `max_element` to store the maximum possible value of the remaining element.
   2. Iterate through the array from the first element to the second last element:
      - For each element `x` at index `i` and its adjacent element `y` at index `i+1`, update `x` to `x - y` and remove `y` from the array.
      - Update `max_element` to the new value of `x`.
   3. Continue this process until only one element remains in the array.
   4. The final value of `max_element` will be the answer.

4. Edge Cases:
   - If the array has only one element, return that element as the result.
   - If the array contains all positive or all negative elements, the strategy should still hold as we always remove the smallest adjacent element.

5. Time Complexity: The time complexity of this approach is O(n) because we iterate through the array once.
6. Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space.
