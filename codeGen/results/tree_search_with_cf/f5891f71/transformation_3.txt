1. Top-down Approach with Memoization:
   - This approach involves solving the problem recursively and storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. It can be more intuitive but may have higher overhead due to recursive calls.
   - Time complexity: O(n), space complexity: O(n).
   - State Expression: Let dp[i] represent the maximum possible value of the remaining element when considering the subarray from the start to the ith element. The transition would involve choosing an element 'x' and its adjacent element 'y', updating 'x' to 'x - y', and removing 'y'.
   - Transition Relationship: For each element dp[i], the transition would be dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] - arr[i], dp[i-1]). This means we either subtract the current element from the previous dp value or we keep the previous dp value as it is.

2. Bottom-up Approach with Tabulation:
   - This approach involves iteratively solving the subproblems and storing the results in a table. It avoids the overhead of recursive calls and can be more efficient in practice.
   - Time complexity: O(n), space complexity: O(n).
   - State Expression: Let dp[i] represent the maximum possible value of the remaining element when considering the subarray from the start to the ith element.
   - Transition Relationship: For each element dp[i], the transition would be dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] - arr[i], dp[i-1]). This means we either subtract the current element from the previous dp value or we keep the previous dp value as it is.
