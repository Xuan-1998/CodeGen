1. Initialize a dp array where dp[i] represents the maximum possible value of the remaining element when considering the subarray from the start up to the i-th element.
2. Base Case: Set dp[0] to arr[0] since with only one element, the maximum possible value is the element itself.
3. Iterate through the array from the second element to the last element:
   - For each element arr[i], update dp[i] using the transition relation: dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] - arr[i], dp[i-1]).
4. The final answer will be the value at dp[n-1], which represents the maximum possible value of the remaining element after considering the entire array.
5. Edge Cases:
   - If the array has only one element, return that element as the result.
   - Ensure that the dp array is properly initialized to handle negative values in the array.
