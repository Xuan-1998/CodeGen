1. Problem Understanding: Given an array of integers, we need to perform a sequence of operations until only one element remains. An operation consists of choosing an element 'x' and its adjacent element 'y', removing 'y' from the array and updating 'x' to 'x - y'. The goal is to find the maximum possible value of the remaining element after all operations.

2. Dynamic Programming Approach:
   - We will use a bottom-up approach with tabulation to solve this problem iteratively.
   - We need to find the maximum possible value of the remaining element by considering the effect of removing adjacent elements and updating the current element.

3. State Definition:
   - Let dp[i] represent the maximum possible value of the remaining element when considering the subarray from index 0 to i.

4. Transition:
   - For each element, calculate the maximum value by considering the effect of removing its adjacent element and updating the current element.
   - The transition relation can be defined as:
     - If i > 0: dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-1] - a[i])
     - If i == 0: dp[i] = a[i]

5. Initialization:
   - Initialize dp[0] with the value of the first element of the array.

6. Iterative Calculation:
   - Iterate through the array from the second element to the last element.
   - Update the dp array using the transition relation defined above.

7. Result:
   - The final result will be the value of dp[n-1], which represents the maximum possible value of the remaining element after performing all operations.

8. Edge Cases:
   - If the array has only one element, the result is the element itself.
   - Consider negative values and large values within the given constraints.

9. Time Complexity: O(n)
   - We iterate through the array once to fill the dp table.

10. Space Complexity: O(n)
   - We use an additional array of size n to store the dp values.
