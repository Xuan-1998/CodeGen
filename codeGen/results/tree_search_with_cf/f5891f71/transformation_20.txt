1. Define the Problem: We need to find the maximum possible value of the remaining element after performing a series of operations on an array of integers. An operation consists of choosing an element 'x' and its adjacent element 'y', removing 'y' from the array and updating 'x' to 'x - y'.

2. Dynamic Programming Approach:
   a. Define dp[i][j] as the maximum possible value of the remaining element when considering the subarray from the i-th element to the j-th element.
   b. Base Case: When there is only one element in the subarray, dp[i][i] = a[i].
   c. Transition: To fill the dp table, we consider the two possible operations:
      - Removing the element at the start of the subarray: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j] - a[i])
      - Removing the element at the end of the subarray: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-1] - a[j])
   d. Iterate over all possible lengths of subarrays from 2 to n and fill the dp table accordingly.

3. Result: The value of dp[0][n-1] will give the maximum possible value of the remaining element for the entire array.

4. Complexity: The time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops for filling the dp table, and the space complexity is also O(n^2) for storing the dp table.

Steps:
1. Initialize the dp table with size n x n.
2. Set the base cases: dp[i][i] = a[i] for all i.
3. Fill the dp table using the transition rules.
4. Return dp[0][n-1] as the result.
