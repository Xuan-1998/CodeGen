1. Top-down Approach with Memoization: This approach involves solving the problem recursively and storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. It can be more intuitive but may have higher overhead due to recursive calls. Time complexity: O(n), space complexity: O(n).

2. State Expression: Let dp[i] represent the maximum possible value of the remaining element when considering the subarray from the start to the ith element. The transition would involve choosing an element 'x' and its adjacent element 'y', updating 'x' to 'x - y', and removing 'y'.

3. Transition Relationship: For each element dp[i], the transition would be dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] - arr[i], dp[i-1]). This means we either subtract the current element from the previous dp value or we keep the previous dp value as it is.

4. Initialization: Initialize dp[0] to arr[0] since the maximum value when only the first element is considered is the element itself.

5. Iterative Calculation: Iterate through the array from the second element to the last element, updating dp[i] based on the transition relationship.

6. Result Extraction: The final result will be found in dp[n-1], which represents the maximum possible value of the remaining element after considering the entire array.

7. Edge Cases:
   - If the array has only one element, the result is the element itself.
   - Handle negative values in the array, ensuring the transition relationship accounts for them correctly.

Steps to implement:
1. Parse the input to get the array size 'n' and the array 'arr'.
2. Initialize the dp array with the same size as 'arr'.
3. Set dp[0] to arr[0].
4. Iterate through the array from the second element to the last element, updating dp[i] using the transition relationship.
5. Print the value of dp[n-1] as the result.
