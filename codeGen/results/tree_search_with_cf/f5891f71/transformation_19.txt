2. Bottom-up Strategy with Tabulation: This approach involves iteratively solving subproblems and building up the solution from the base cases. It is generally more efficient in terms of both time and space as it avoids the overhead of recursion. Time complexity: O(n^2), space complexity: O(n^2)
Base Case: The base case is straightforward: dp[i][i] = a[i] because if there's only one element in the subarray, it remains as it is.
State: Let dp[i][j] be the maximum possible value of the remaining element when considering the subarray from the i-th element to the j-th element.
Transition: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j] - a[i], dp[i][j-1] - a[j]), where dp[i+1][j] and dp[i][j-1] are the maximum possible values from the subarrays excluding the current elements.
Initialization: Initialize the dp array with base cases where dp[i][i] = a[i] for all i.
Final Output: The final answer will be dp[0][n-1], which represents the maximum possible value for the entire array.
