1. Define the problem in terms of Dynamic Programming.
2. State: Let dp[i] represent the maximum possible value of the remaining element when considering the subarray from index 0 to i.
3. Base Case: The base case is when the array has only one element left, which means dp[0] = a[0].
4. Transition:
   - For each element, calculate the maximum value by considering the effect of removing its adjacent element and updating the current element.
   - The transition relation can be defined as:
     - If i == 1: dp[i] = max(a[i], a[i-1] - a[i])
     - If i > 1: dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] - a[i])
5. Iterate through the array and fill the dp array using the above transition relations.
6. The final answer will be stored in dp[n-1], which represents the maximum possible value of the remaining element after considering all elements.
7. Return the value of dp[n-1] as the result.
8. Consider edge cases:
   - If the array has only one element, the result is the element itself.
   - If the array has two elements, the result is the maximum of the first element and the first element minus the second element.
