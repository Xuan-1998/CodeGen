1. Define the problem as finding the maximum possible value of the remaining element after performing a sequence of operations on the array.
2. Use a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization to solve the problem recursively and avoid redundant calculations.
3. Define a state expression:
   - Let dp[i] represent the maximum possible value of the remaining element when considering the subarray from the start to the ith element.
4. Initialize the base case:
   - dp[0] = array[0], as the maximum value when considering only the first element is the element itself.
5. Define the recursive transition:
   - For each element i from 1 to n-1, update dp[i] by considering the operation of choosing element array[i-1] and its adjacent element array[i], updating array[i-1] to array[i-1] - array[i], and removing array[i].
   - This can be expressed as dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-1] - array[i]) where dp[i-1] represents the value of the previous element after performing the operation.
6. Iterate through the array and apply the transition to fill the dp array.
7. The final result will be the maximum value in the dp array after all operations have been performed.
8. Consider edge cases:
   - When the array has only one element, the result is the element itself.
   - When the array has two elements, the result is the maximum value after performing the operation once.
9. Ensure the solution handles the constraints efficiently, with time complexity O(n) and space complexity O(n).
