1. Top-down Approach with Memoization:
    - Base Case: When the array has only one element left, dp[i][i] = a[i].
    - State: Define dp[i][j] as the maximum possible value of the remaining element when considering the subarray from index i to j.
    - Transition: For each subarray, choose an element and its adjacent element, remove the adjacent element, and update the chosen element. The transition relation can be dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][k] - a[k+1], dp[k+1][j] - a[k]) for all k from i to j-1.
2. Memoization: Store the results of subproblems in a 2D array dp to avoid redundant calculations.
3. Time complexity: O(n^2)
4. Space complexity: O(n^2)
5. Initialization: Initialize a 2D array dp of size n x n with -1 to indicate uncomputed subproblems.
6. Recursive Function: Implement a recursive function that takes the indices i and j and returns the maximum possible value of the remaining element for the subarray from index i to j.
7. Edge Cases: Handle edge cases where the array size is 1.
8. Final Result: The final result will be stored in dp[0][n-1], representing the maximum possible value for the entire array.
