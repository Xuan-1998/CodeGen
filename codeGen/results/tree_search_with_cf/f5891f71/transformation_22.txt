1. Problem Understanding: The task is to perform a sequence of operations on an array until only one element remains, and we need to maximize the value of this remaining element. The operation involves choosing an element 'x' and its adjacent element 'y', removing 'y' from the array, and updating 'x' to 'x - y'.

2. Approach: Use a Greedy Strategy. The goal is to maximize the value of the remaining element by making optimal choices at each step.

3. Strategy: 
    a. Sort the array in descending order.
    b. Initialize a variable `result` with the value of the first element of the sorted array.
    c. Iterate through the sorted array starting from the second element:
        - For each element `a[i]`, update `result` to `result - a[i]`.
    d. The final value of `result` will be the maximum possible value of the remaining element after all operations.

4. Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting.
5. Space Complexity: O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

6. Edge Cases:
    - If the array has only one element, return that element.
    - If all elements are the same, the result will be the first element minus the sum of all other elements.
    - Handle negative numbers appropriately as they will affect the subtraction operation.
