1. Problem Understanding: We need to find the maximum possible value of the remaining element after performing a sequence of operations on the array. An operation consists of choosing an element 'x' and its adjacent element 'y', removing 'y' from the array, and updating 'x' to 'x - y'.

2. Dynamic Programming Approach: We will use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. This approach involves solving the problem recursively and storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

3. State Definition: Let dp[i] represent the maximum possible value of the remaining element when considering the subarray from the start to the ith element.

4. Transition Relationship: 
   - For each element dp[i], the transition would be:
     dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] - arr[i], dp[i-1])
   - This means we either subtract the current element from the previous dp value or we keep the previous dp value as it is.

5. Base Case: 
   - dp[0] = arr[0], as the subarray with only one element is the element itself.

6. Result: The result will be stored in dp[n-1], which represents the maximum possible value after considering all elements.

7. Edge Cases: 
   - If n = 1, the result is the single element itself.
   - If the array contains both positive and negative elements, the transitions should handle the maximum value correctly.

8. Implementation Steps:
   - Read input values.
   - Initialize the dp array.
   - Iterate through the array and update the dp values using the transition relationship.
   - Output the result stored in dp[n-1].
