1. Define the problem in terms of dynamic programming. Let dp[i] represent the maximum possible value of the remaining element when considering the subarray from the start to the ith element.
2. Initialize the dp array where dp[0] is the first element of the array since there are no elements to remove before it.
3. Iterate through the array from the second element to the last element.
4. For each element arr[i], update dp[i] as dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] - arr[i], arr[i]). This means we either subtract the current element from the previous dp value or we start a new subarray from the current element.
5. The final answer will be the maximum value in the dp array after processing all elements.
6. Handle edge cases:
   - If the array has only one element, the answer is that element itself.
   - If all elements are negative, the strategy will still hold as we are always taking the maximum possible value.
