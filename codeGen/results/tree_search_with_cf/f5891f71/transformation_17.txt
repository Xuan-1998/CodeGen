1. State: Let dp[i] be the maximum possible value of the remaining element when considering the subarray from the i-th element to the end of the array.
2. Transition: dp[i] = max(dp[i+1] - a[i], a[i] - dp[i+1]), where dp[i+1] is the maximum possible value from the next element onward.
3. Base Case: The base case is straightforward: dp[n-1] = a[n-1] because if there's only one element, it remains as it is.
4. Bottom-up Strategy with Tabulation: This approach involves iteratively solving subproblems and building up the solution from the base cases. It is generally more efficient in terms of both time and space as it avoids the overhead of recursion. Time complexity: O(n), space complexity: O(n)
5. Tabulation: Create a dp array of size n. Initialize dp[n-1] with a[n-1]. Iterate from i = n-2 to 0 and apply the transition formula to fill up the dp array.
6. Result: The maximum possible value of the remaining element after all operations is stored in dp[0].
