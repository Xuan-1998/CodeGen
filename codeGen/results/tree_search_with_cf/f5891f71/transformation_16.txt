1. Bottom-up Strategy with Tabulation: This approach involves iteratively solving subproblems and building up the solution from the base cases. It is generally more efficient in terms of both time and space as it avoids the overhead of recursion. Time complexity: O(n), space complexity: O(n).

2. State Expression: Let dp[i] be the maximum possible value of the remaining element when considering the subarray from the start up to the i-th element. The transition would involve considering the effect of removing the i-th element and updating the (i-1)-th element.

3. Transition Relationship: The transition can be formulated as dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] - arr[i], dp[i-1]), where arr[i] is the current element being considered. This ensures that we are maximizing the value of the remaining element by either subtracting the current element from the previous one or not performing the operation at all.

4. Initialization: Initialize dp[0] with the first element of the array, since there are no previous elements to consider.

5. Iteration: Iterate through the array from the second element to the last element, updating the dp array using the transition relationship.

6. Result: The maximum possible value of the remaining element after performing all operations will be found in dp[n-1].

7. Edge Cases: Consider edge cases where the array has only one element (no operations needed) or where all elements are negative or positive.
