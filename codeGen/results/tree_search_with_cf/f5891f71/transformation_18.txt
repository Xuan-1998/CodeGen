2. Bottom-up Strategy with Tabulation: This approach involves iteratively solving subproblems and building up the solution from the base cases. It is generally more efficient in terms of both time and space as it avoids the overhead of recursion. Time complexity: O(n), space complexity: O(n).

1. State: Let dp[i] be the maximum possible value of the remaining element when considering the subarray from the i-th element to the end of the array.

2. Base Case: The base case is straightforward: dp[n-1] = a[n-1] because if there's only one element, it remains as it is.

3. Transition: For each element from the second last to the first element, update dp[i] as follows:
   dp[i] = max(dp[i+1] - a[i], a[i] - dp[i+1]), where dp[i+1] is the maximum possible value from the next element onward.

4. Memoization: This approach involves solving subproblems and storing their results to avoid redundant calculations. Time complexity: O(n), space complexity: O(n).

5. Result: The value dp[0] will be the maximum possible value of the remaining element after performing the operations on the entire array.
