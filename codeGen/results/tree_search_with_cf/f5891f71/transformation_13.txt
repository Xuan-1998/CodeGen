2. Bottom-up Strategy with Tabulation: This approach involves iteratively solving subproblems and building up the solution from the base cases. It is generally more efficient in terms of both time and space as it avoids the overhead of recursion. Time complexity: O(n), space complexity: O(n).

State Expression: Let dp[i] be the maximum possible value of the remaining element when considering the subarray from the start up to the i-th element. The transition would involve considering the effect of removing the i-th element and updating the (i-1)-th element.

1. Initialize the dp array: Create an array dp of size n where dp[i] represents the maximum possible value of the remaining element when considering the subarray from the start up to the i-th element.

2. Base Case: Set dp[0] = a[0] because when there's only one element, the maximum possible value is the element itself.

3. Transition: Iterate through the array from the second element to the end. For each element, update dp[i] as dp[i-1] - a[i] because removing the i-th element and updating the (i-1)-th element would result in dp[i-1] - a[i].

4. Result: The value of dp[n-1] will be the maximum possible value of the remaining element after performing all operations.

Steps:
1. Read input values.
2. Initialize dp array.
3. Set the base case.
4. Iterate through the array to fill the dp array.
5. Output the result.
