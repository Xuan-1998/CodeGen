1. **Base Case**: The base case is straightforward: if there's only one element, it remains as it is.
2. **State Definition**: Let dp[i][j] be the maximum possible value of the remaining element when considering the subarray from the i-th element to the j-th element.
3. **Transition**: For each subarray from index i to j:
   - If we choose the leftmost element 'a[i]' and its adjacent element 'a[i+1]', we remove 'a[i+1]' and update 'a[i]' to 'a[i] - a[i+1]'.
   - If we choose the rightmost element 'a[j]' and its adjacent element 'a[j-1]', we remove 'a[j-1]' and update 'a[j]' to 'a[j] - a[j-1]'.
   - Therefore, the transition relation is:
     dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j] - a[i], dp[i][j-1] - a[j])
4. **Initialization**: Initialize the dp array for all single-element subarrays: dp[i][i] = a[i].
5. **Iteration**: Iterate over all possible subarray lengths from 2 to n, and for each length, iterate over all possible starting indices to fill the dp table.
6. **Result**: The answer will be in dp[0][n-1], representing the maximum possible value for the entire array.
7. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n^2) because we are filling an n x n table.
8. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n^2) for storing the dp table.
