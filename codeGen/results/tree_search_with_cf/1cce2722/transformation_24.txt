1. Frequency Count: Create an array `count` of size 105 (since the maximum value of ai is 105) to store the frequency of each integer in the sequence.
2. Initialize DP Array: Create a dp array of size 105. Initialize dp[0] = 0 (since no points can be obtained from an empty set) and dp[1] = count[1] (since we can only take the integer 1 if it exists).
3. Transition: For each integer i from 2 to 105, the relation is dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + count[i] * i). This relation captures the decision to either take or skip the integer i.
4. Result: The value dp[105] will contain the maximum points that can be obtained.
