1. Frequency Count: Create an array `count` of size 105 (since the maximum value of ai is 105) to store the frequency of each integer in the sequence.
2. Bottom-Up Strategy with Tabulation: This approach builds up the solution iteratively from the base cases using a table to store results of subproblems. The time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(105) due to the table used for storing results.
3. State Expression: Let dp[x] be the maximum points that can be obtained considering all integers from 1 to x. The transition relation will be dp[x] = max(dp[x-1], dp[x-2] + count[x] * x), where count[x] is the frequency of the integer x in the sequence.
4. Base Cases: dp[0] = 0 and dp[1] = count[1] * 1. These base cases are essential for the transition relation to build upon.
5. Iteration: Iterate from 2 to 105 to fill the dp table using the state expression.
6. Result: The maximum points that can be obtained is dp[105].
