1. **Frequency Count**: First, create a frequency array `count` where `count[x]` represents the number of times integer `x` appears in the sequence. Initialize this array with zeros and then populate it by iterating through the input sequence.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: Create a DP array `dp` where `dp[x]` represents the maximum points that can be obtained considering all integers from 1 to `x`. Initialize `dp[0]` to 0.

3. **Base Cases**: 
   - If the maximum value in the sequence is `1`, then `dp[1] = count[1] * 1` because there's no `0` to consider.
   - If the maximum value is greater than `1`, initialize `dp[1]` to `count[1] * 1`.

4. **DP Transition**: Iterate through integers from `2` to the maximum value in the sequence, and for each integer `x`, update `dp[x]` using the relation:
