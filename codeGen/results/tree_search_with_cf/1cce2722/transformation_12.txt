1. State Expression: Let dp[x] be the maximum points that can be obtained considering all integers from 1 to x. The transition relation will be dp[x] = max(dp[x-1], dp[x-2] + count[x] * x), where count[x] is the frequency of the integer x in the sequence.

2. Bottom-Up Strategy with Tabulation: This approach builds up the solution iteratively from the base cases using a table to store results of subproblems. The time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n) due to the table used for storing results.

3. Detailed Steps:
   a. Initialize an array `count` of size 105 (since the maximum value of ai is 105) to store the frequency of each integer in the sequence.
   b. Populate the `count` array by iterating through the input sequence and incrementing the count of each integer.
   c. Initialize a dp array of size 105 to store the maximum points for each integer up to 105.
   d. Set dp[0] = 0 and dp[1] = count[1] * 1.
   e. Iterate from 2 to 105 to fill the dp array using the relation dp[x] = max(dp[x-1], dp[x-2] + count[x] * x).
   f. The final answer will be dp[105], which contains the maximum points that can be obtained.

4. Edge Cases:
   a. If n = 1, the answer is simply the value of the single integer in the sequence.
   b. If all integers in the sequence are the same, the strategy should correctly identify that removing all instances of that integer is optimal.
   c. If the sequence contains a mix of integers with no consecutive values, the strategy should correctly sum the values of all integers.
