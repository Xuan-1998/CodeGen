1. Problem Analysis: The problem is about maximizing the points earned by selectively removing integers from a sequence along with their adjacent values. This can be approached using Dynamic Programming.
2. State Expression: Let dp[x] be the maximum points that can be obtained considering all integers from 1 to x.

3. Transition Relationship:
   - If we take all instances of x, we gain x * count[x] points, and we cannot take x-1, so we add this to dp[x-2].
   - If we skip x, we just take the result of dp[x-1].
   - Therefore, the relation is: dp[x] = max(dp[x-1], dp[x-2] + x * count[x]).

4. Initialization:
   - dp[0] = 0 (no points can be earned from an empty sequence).
   - dp[1] = count[1] (points earned by taking all instances of 1).

5. Iteration:
   - Iterate from 2 to the maximum value in the sequence (let's call it max_val).
   - For each value x, update dp[x] using the transition relationship.

6. Result:
   - The result will be dp[max_val], which gives the maximum points that can be obtained.

7. Edge Cases:
   - If n = 1, the result is simply the value of the single element in the sequence.
   - If all elements are the same, the result is the value of that element times its count.
   - If elements are consecutive, the algorithm should correctly handle the removal of adjacent values.

8. Complexity:
   - Time Complexity: O(n + max_val), where max_val is the maximum value in the sequence.
   - Space Complexity: O(max_val), for storing the dp array and count array.

Steps:
1. Read the input values.
2. Count the frequency of each integer in the sequence.
3. Initialize the dp array.
4. Apply the transition relationship to fill the dp array.
5. Output the result from dp[max_val].
