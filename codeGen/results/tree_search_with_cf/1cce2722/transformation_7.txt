1. Count Frequencies: First, iterate through the sequence to count the frequency of each integer. This will help in determining the points earned by selecting a particular integer.
2. Initialize a DP Array: Create a dp array where dp[x] represents the maximum points that can be obtained considering numbers up to x in the sequence.
3. Base Cases: 
   - dp[0] = 0, as no points can be earned from an empty sequence.
   - dp[1] = frequency[1], as the only option is to take all 1's.
4. State Transition: For each number x from 2 to the maximum integer value in the sequence:
   - Either take all occurrences of x and add x * frequency[x] to the result from dp[x-2].
   - Or skip x and take the result from dp[x-1].
   - Therefore, the relationship is dp[x] = max(dp[x-1], dp[x-2] + x * frequency[x]).
5. Result: The maximum points that can be obtained is stored in dp[max_value], where max_value is the maximum integer in the sequence.
