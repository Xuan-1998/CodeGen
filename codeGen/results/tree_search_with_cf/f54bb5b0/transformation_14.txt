1. **State Representation**: Define dp[u][d] to represent the count of vertices that are exactly at distance d from vertex u. 
   - Base Case: dp[u][0] = 1 for all u, as the distance from a vertex to itself is zero.
   
2. **State Transition**: For each vertex u, calculate dp[u][d] using the values of dp from its child vertices.
   - Transition Relation: dp[u][d] = sum(dp[v][d-1] for each child v of u). This means that the number of vertices at distance d from u can be found by summing the number of vertices at distance d-1 from each of u's children.
   
3. **DFS Traversal**: Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal of the tree to calculate the dp values. 
   - During the DFS traversal, for each vertex u, update dp[u][d] based on its children.
   - Use memoization to store the results of sub-problems to avoid redundant computations.
   
4. **Counting Pairs**: For each vertex u, count the number of pairs (u, v) such that the path length between them is exactly k.
   - Use the dp values calculated during the DFS traversal to count these pairs.
   - For each vertex u, the number of pairs with distance k can be found by summing dp[u][k] for all u.
   
5. **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases such as:
   - Smallest tree with n = 1.
   - Trees with k greater than the possible maximum path length.
   - Ensure that the solution handles trees with varying structures (e.g., skewed trees, balanced trees).
   
6. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity of this approach is O(n*k), and the space complexity is O(n*k) due to the dp table.
