1. Define the state dp[u][d] where dp[u][d] represents the number of paths of length d that start from vertex u.
2. Initialize the base case: dp[u][0] = 1 for all u, because a path of length 0 from a vertex to itself is always possible.
3. Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) to fill the dp table:
   a. For each vertex u, calculate dp[u][d] for all d from 1 to k.
   b. For each neighbor v of u, update dp[u][d] using dp[v][d-1] because extending a path of length d-1 from v to u forms a path of length d.
4. Use a secondary array to store intermediate results to avoid double-counting paths.
5. During the DFS traversal, count the number of valid pairs of vertices that have a path of exactly length k between them:
   a. For each vertex u, consider all pairs (u, v) such that the path length between them is exactly k.
   b. Use the dp table to count these pairs efficiently.
6. Ensure that each pair is counted only once by maintaining a visited set or using properties of the tree structure.
7. Return the total count of valid pairs.
