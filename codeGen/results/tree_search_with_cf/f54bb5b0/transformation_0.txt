1. Parse the input to read the number of vertices n, the required path length k, and the edges of the tree.
2. Construct the tree using an adjacency list representation.
3. Initialize a 2D list dp where dp[u][d] represents the number of vertices that are at a distance d from vertex u.
4. Define a recursive function dfs(u, parent) to perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from vertex u and considering parent as the parent vertex of u.
5. In the dfs function:
    a. Set dp[u][0] = 1 since each vertex is at distance 0 from itself.
    b. For each child v of u (excluding the parent vertex):
        i. Recursively call dfs(v, u) to compute dp values for the subtree rooted at v.
        ii. After returning from the recursive call, update dp[u] using the dp values of its child v. Specifically, for each distance d from 1 to k, update dp[u][d] += dp[v][d-1].
        iii. Count valid pairs where the total distance between vertices in different subtrees rooted at u is exactly k. This can be done by iterating over all pairs of distances that sum up to k and multiplying the respective dp values.
6. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of valid pairs.
7. Call the dfs function starting from any arbitrary root (e.g., vertex 1) with a parent of -1.
8. Output the counter as the result.
