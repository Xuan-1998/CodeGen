1. Define the state expression dp[u][d] to represent the number of vertices that are at a distance d from vertex u.
2. Initialize the base case: dp[u][0] = 1 for all vertices u, since each vertex is at distance 0 from itself.
3. Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree and compute the dp values for each subtree.
4. For each vertex u, maintain an array dp[u] where dp[u][d] indicates the number of vertices at distance d from u in the subtree rooted at u.
5. While performing DFS, for each child v of a vertex u, combine the dp values of v into the dp values of u to update the distances from u.
6. After computing the dp values for a vertex u, count the number of valid pairs (u, v) such that the path length from u to v is exactly k by considering all subtrees rooted at u.
7. To count the pairs, for each vertex u, iterate through its dp array and for each distance d, look for pairs (u, v) where the distance from u to v is exactly k.
8. Use a global counter to keep track of the total number of valid pairs found.
9. Finally, output the global counter as the result.

Edge Cases:
- The smallest tree with n = 1, k = 1.
- Trees where k is larger than the maximum possible path length in the tree (no valid pairs).
- Trees with varying structures, such as skewed trees or balanced trees.
