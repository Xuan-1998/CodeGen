1. Top-Down Approach with Memoization:
   - This dynamic programming approach involves breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems and storing the results of these sub-problems to avoid redundant computations. It generally uses recursion and a memoization table.
   - Time complexity: O(n*k), space complexity: O(n*k)
   
2. State Expression:
   - Let dp[u][d] be the number of vertices that are at a distance d from vertex u.
   - Base Case: dp[u][0] = 1 for all vertices u, since each vertex is at distance 0 from itself.
   - State Transition: The state dp[u][d] can be derived from the states of its child vertices. For each vertex u, if v is a child of u, then dp[u][d] can be updated using dp[v][d-1]. Specifically, dp[u][d] += dp[v][d-1] for all children v of u.

3. Implementation Steps:
   - Parse the input to get the number of vertices n, the required path length k, and the edges of the tree.
   - Construct the adjacency list representation of the tree.
   - Initialize the dp table with dimensions n x (k+1) and set all values to 0.
   - Define a recursive function to perform a DFS on the tree. This function should update the dp table based on the state transition described above.
   - During the DFS, count the number of valid pairs of vertices that have a path of exactly length k between them by using the dp values.
   - Output the total count of such pairs.
