1. **Initialization**: 
   - Read the input values for n and k.
   - Read the edges and construct the adjacency list for the tree.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Definition**:
   - Define a DP table `dp[u][d]` where `dp[u][d]` represents the number of vertices at distance `d` from vertex `u`.
   - Initialize the base case: `dp[u][0] = 1` for all vertices `u` since each vertex is at distance 0 from itself.

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Traversal**:
   - Perform a DFS traversal of the tree starting from any root (e.g., vertex 1).
   - During the DFS traversal, update the DP table for each vertex based on its children's DP values.

4. **Merging DP Values**:
   - For each vertex `u`, after processing all its children, merge the DP values of the children into the DP values of `u`.
   - This merging step ensures that `dp[u][d]` correctly counts the number of vertices at distance `d` from `u`, considering the subtree rooted at `u`.

5. **Count Valid Pairs**:
   - For each vertex `u`, count the number of valid pairs of vertices `(u, v)` such that the distance between `u` and `v` is exactly `k`.
   - Use the DP table to efficiently count pairs by considering the contributions from different subtrees.

6. **Output the Result**:
   - Sum up the counts of valid pairs from all vertices and print the result.
