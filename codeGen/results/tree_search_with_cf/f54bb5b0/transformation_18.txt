1. Top-Down Approach with Memoization:
   - Use recursion and a memoization table to avoid redundant computations.
   - Define dp[u][d] as the count of vertices that are exactly at distance d from vertex u.
   - Base Case: dp[u][0] = 1 for all u, as the distance from a vertex to itself is zero.
   - Transition: For each child v of u, update dp[u][d] by adding dp[v][d-1].

2. Counting Pairs:
   - For each vertex u, to count the number of pairs (u, v) with a path of length k, use the dp values of its children.
   - Specifically, for each child v of u, the number of such pairs is the product of dp[v][d-1] and dp[u][k-d-1].
   - Use a DFS to traverse the tree and compute the dp values.
   - While computing dp values, also count the pairs by considering the paths that go through the parent.

3. Implementation Steps:
   - Read the input values n and k.
   - Construct the tree using adjacency lists.
   - Initialize the dp table with size n x (k+1) and set dp[u][0] = 1 for all u.
   - Perform a DFS to fill the dp table.
   - During the DFS, count the number of valid pairs using the dp values of children.
   - Output the total count of valid pairs.

4. Edge Cases:
   - Smallest tree with n = 1.
   - Trees where k is larger than the maximum possible path length.
   - Ensure no double-counting of pairs.
