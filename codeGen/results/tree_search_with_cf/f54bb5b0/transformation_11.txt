1. Represent the tree using an adjacency list. This will allow efficient traversal of the tree.

2. Define a 2D list `dp` where `dp[u][d]` represents the number of paths of length `d` that start from vertex `u`.

3. Initialize the base case: `dp[u][0] = 1` for all vertices `u`, because there is exactly one path of length 0 from any vertex to itself.

4. Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) to compute the `dp` values:
   - For each vertex `u`, recursively compute the values of `dp[v][d-1]` for all neighbors `v` of `u`.
   - Use these values to compute `dp[u][d]` as the sum of `dp[v][d-1]` for all neighbors `v` of `u`.

5. During the DFS traversal, keep track of the number of valid paths of length `k`:
   - For each vertex `u`, before moving to its children, calculate the number of valid paths of length `k` that pass through `u` using the `dp` values of its neighbors.
   - Sum these counts to get the total number of valid paths of length `k`.

6. Return the total count of valid paths of length `k`.

Edge Cases:
- If `n = 1`, there are no edges, hence no paths of length `k` for any `k >= 1`.
- If `k > n-1`, it's impossible to have a path of length `k` in the tree.

Time Complexity: O(n*k) due to the DFS traversal and computation of `dp` values.
Space Complexity: O(n*k) for storing the `dp` values.
