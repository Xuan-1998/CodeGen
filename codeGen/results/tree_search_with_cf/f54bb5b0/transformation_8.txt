1. **Top-Down Approach with Memoization**: This dynamic programming approach involves breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems and storing the results of these sub-problems to avoid redundant computations. It uses recursion and a memoization table.

2. **State Expression**: 
   - Let `dp[u][d]` be the number of vertices that are at a distance `d` from vertex `u`.
   - Base Case: `dp[u][0] = 1` for all vertices `u`, since each vertex is at distance 0 from itself.

3. **Recursive Computation**:
   - For each vertex `u`, recursively compute the number of vertices at distance `d` from `u` using its children.
   - If `v` is a child of `u`, then for each distance `d`, update `dp[u][d]` using `dp[v][d-1]`.

4. **Combine Results**:
   - For each vertex `u`, to count pairs `(u, v)` with a path length of exactly `k`, consider pairs `(u, v)` such that `v` is a descendant of `u`. This requires combining results from `dp` tables of `u` and its children.
   - Use a temporary array to store intermediate results to avoid counting pairs multiple times.

5. **Summing Up Valid Pairs**:
   - Sum up all valid pairs for each vertex `u` to get the total number of distinct pairs in the tree with a path length of exactly `k`. This involves iterating through all vertices and their respective distances in the `dp` table.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle cases where `n = 1` or `k = 1`.
   - Ensure that the tree structure is properly maintained and there are no cycles.

7. **Time and Space Complexity**:
   - Time complexity: O(n * k), as each vertex and distance combination is processed once.
   - Space complexity: O(n * k), for storing the `dp` table.
