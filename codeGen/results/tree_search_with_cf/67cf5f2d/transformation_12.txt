1. Sort the points based on their positions in ascending order. This ensures that we process points from left to right, which will make the state transitions easier to manage.
2. Define the state expression: Let dp[i] be the minimum number of points removed if we consider the first i points and add the additional point to the right of all existing points. Initialize dp[0] = 0, since if there are no points, no points can be removed.
3. Iterate over each point i from 1 to n. For each point i, determine the impact of adding the additional point and how it affects the removal of other points:
   a. Let j be the rightmost point that will not be removed when point i is activated. This can be determined by finding the largest index j such that the position of point j is greater than the position of point i minus the range of point i.
   b. Update dp[i] as the minimum of dp[i-1] (not activating point i) or dp[j] + (i - j - 1) (activating point i and removing points between j and i).
4. The final answer will be the minimum number of points removed when considering all points and adding the additional point to the right, which is dp[n].

Time complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting and O(n) for the DP transitions, resulting in an overall complexity of O(n log n).
Space complexity: O(n) for storing the dp array.
