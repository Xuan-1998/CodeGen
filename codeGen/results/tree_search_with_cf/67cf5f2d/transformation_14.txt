2. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This approach involves solving all subproblems iteratively and storing their results in a table. It generally requires less overhead compared to the top-down approach and is often more efficient in terms of both time and space for problems with overlapping subproblems.

1. Define the state expression: Let dp[i] be the minimum number of points removed if we consider the first i points and add the additional point to the right of all existing points. Base case: dp[0] = 0, since if there are no points, no points can be removed.

2. State: Define dp[i] as the minimum number of points removed when the first i points are considered, and one additional point is added to the right.

3. Transition: Sort the points by their positions in ascending order. For each point i, calculate dp[i] by examining all previous points j (j < i) to see if they lie within the range of bi from point i. Update dp[i] using the relation dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1) if point j is within the range of bi from point i.

4. Iterate through all points from right to left, updating the dp array based on the above transition.

5. The final answer will be the minimum value in the dp array after considering the additional point to the right.

6. Time complexity: O(n^2) due to the nested loop for transitions. Space complexity: O(n) for storing the dp array.
