1. Sort the points based on their position in ascending order. This ensures that we can process points from left to right.
2. Define the state expression: Let dp[i] be the minimum number of points removed if we consider the first i points and add the additional point to the right of all existing points.
3. Initialize the dp array: dp[0] = 0, since if there are no points, no points can be removed.
4. Iterate through each point i from 1 to n:
   a. Set dp[i] to be the maximum possible value initially.
   b. Iterate through each previous point j from 0 to i-1:
      i. If point j lies within the range bi from point i (i.e., aj >= ai - bi), update dp[i] using the relation dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1).
5. The final answer will be dp[n], which represents the minimum number of points removed when considering all n points and adding the additional point to the right.
6. Output the value of dp[n].

Edge Cases:
- If n = 1, the answer is 0 since adding one point to the right will not affect the single point.
- If all points have the same range bi, the solution should still correctly account for overlapping ranges.
- Ensure that the solution handles the maximum constraints efficiently.

Time Complexity: O(n^2) due to the nested loops iterating through the points.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the dp array.
