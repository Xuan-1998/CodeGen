===UPDATED PLAN===
1. Precompute all possible "beautiful" patterns of length up to 3, as these are the only lengths that can contain palindromes in the given problem constraints.
2. Generate all possible "beautiful" strings of length up to 3 using the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. These patterns will be 'abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cab', and 'cba'.
3. Precompute the cost to transform any substring of length up to 3 into each of the "beautiful" patterns. This can be stored in a table where each entry represents the minimum cost to transform a substring into a specific pattern.
4. Use a sliding window approach to compute the cost for all substrings of the given string `s` of lengths 1, 2, and 3. Store these costs in a table.
5. For each query, determine the length of the substring and use the precomputed table to quickly find the minimum cost to transform the substring into a "beautiful" string.
6. Output the cost for each query.

Steps:
1. Precompute the "beautiful" patterns and their transformation costs.
2. Iterate over the string with a sliding window to compute the transformation costs for all substrings of length 1, 2, and 3.
3. For each query, use the precomputed costs to determine the minimum cost for transforming the specified substring into a "beautiful" string.
4. Output the results for each query.

Edge Cases:
1. Single character substrings are always beautiful, so the cost is 0.
2. Substrings of length 2 or 3 can be directly compared to precomputed patterns to find the minimum transformation cost.
3. Queries that span the entire string should be handled efficiently using the precomputed costs.

Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n is the length of the string and m is the number of queries.
Space Complexity: O(n), for storing the precomputed transformation costs.
