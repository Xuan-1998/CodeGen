1. Identify the problem constraints and requirements:
   - The string contains only the first three lowercase Latin alphabets ('a', 'b', 'c').
   - We need to avoid palindromic substrings of length 2 or more.
   - Each query specifies a substring and we need to calculate the minimum cost to make it "beautiful".

2. Define the state expression:
   - Let dp[i][j] be the minimum cost to make the substring s[i:j] beautiful.
   - Base case: dp[i][i] = 0 since a single character substring is inherently beautiful.

3. Precompute all possible beautiful patterns:
   - There are only 3 characters ('a', 'b', 'c'), so the possible non-palindromic patterns of length up to 3 are limited.
   - Generate all permutations of length 1 to 3 of 'a', 'b', 'c' and check which are non-palindromic.

4. Build the dp table using a bottom-up strategy:
   - Initialize a 2D dp array of size n x n, where n is the length of the string.
   - Iterate over all possible substring lengths from 2 to n.
   - For each substring length, iterate over all possible starting positions.
   - For each substring, calculate the minimum cost to transform it into one of the precomputed beautiful patterns.

5. Answer each query efficiently:
   - For each query, use the precomputed dp table to get the minimum cost for the specified substring.
   - Output the result for each query.

6. Optimize the solution:
   - Instead of storing the dp table for all substrings, use a sliding window approach to reduce space complexity.
   - Precompute the cost for transforming each substring of length 2 and 3 and use these precomputed values to answer the queries.

7. Implementation steps:
   - Parse the input values.
   - Precompute the beautiful patterns and their transformation costs.
   - Build the dp table using the bottom-up approach.
   - Answer each query using the precomputed values.
