1. State Definition: Let dp[i][j] represent the minimum cost to make the substring s[i:j] beautiful. Base Case: dp[i][i] = 0 since a single character substring is inherently beautiful.

2. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This approach involves filling up a table iteratively based on the results of smaller subproblems. It can be more intuitive and straightforward to implement, ensuring that all subproblems are solved in a structured manner. Time complexity: O(n * n), space complexity: O(n * n).

3. Transition: To compute dp[i][j], consider the following:
   - If the substring s[i:j] is already beautiful, dp[i][j] = 0.
   - If not, we need to check all possible ways to make it beautiful by changing characters. This involves checking every possible split point k (i <= k < j) and calculating the cost of making both s[i:k] and s[k+1:j] beautiful, then adding the cost of any necessary changes at the split point.

4. Precompute Costs: To efficiently determine the cost of making any substring beautiful, precompute the cost of transforming every possible substring of length 1, 2, and 3 into a beautiful string. Use these precomputed costs to fill up the dp table.

5. Query Processing: For each query (l_i, r_i), directly use the precomputed dp table to get the result in O(1) time.

6. Edge Cases: Consider cases where the string is already beautiful, where the substring length is 1, and where the entire string needs to be transformed.

7. Implementation: Implement the plan in a structured manner, ensuring to handle the input and output as specified.
