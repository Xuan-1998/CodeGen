1. Precomputation: Prepare three possible "beautiful" patterns of length n using the first three lowercase Latin alphabets: "abc", "bca", and "cab". These patterns will help in calculating the minimum changes required for any substring to become beautiful.
2. Cost Calculation: For each position in the original string, precompute the cost to convert the substring starting from the beginning of the string up to that position to each of the three beautiful patterns. Store these costs in three separate arrays: cost1, cost2, and cost3.
3. Query Handling: For each query, calculate the cost to transform the substring into a "beautiful" string by using the precomputed costs. Specifically, for a query (l, r), calculate the cost of converting s[l-1:r] to each of the three patterns and return the minimum cost among them.
4. Edge Cases: Ensure that the solution handles edge cases such as when the substring length is 1 (it is already beautiful) and when the substring spans the entire string.
5. Time Complexity: The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, and each query can be answered in O(1) time due to the precomputed costs. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n + m).
6. Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(n) for storing the three cost arrays.
