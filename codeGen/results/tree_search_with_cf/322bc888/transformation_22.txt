1. Define the problem in terms of Dynamic Programming (DP). Use a bottom-up strategy with tabulation to fill up a table iteratively based on the results of smaller subproblems. This ensures that all subproblems are solved in a structured manner. However, considering the constraints, we need to optimize the approach to handle large inputs efficiently.
2. State expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the minimum cost to make the substring s[i:j+1] beautiful. However, due to high space complexity, we should aim to reduce the problem to a manageable size.
3. Precompute the minimum cost to transform any substring of length 3 into a "beautiful" string. There are only 6 possible patterns for a beautiful string of length 3: "abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba". We can compute the cost to transform any substring of length 3 to each of these patterns.
4. For each query, break down the problem into chunks of length 3 and use the precomputed costs to quickly determine the minimum cost for each chunk. If the substring length is not a multiple of 3, handle the remaining characters separately.
5. Iterate through each query, calculate the total cost using the precomputed values, and output the result.
6. Ensure to handle edge cases, such as very small substrings (length 1 or 2), separately.
