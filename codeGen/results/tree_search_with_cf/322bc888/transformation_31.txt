1. Identify Patterns: Since the string is composed of only three characters ('a', 'b', 'c'), and we need to avoid palindromes of length 2 or more, we can precompute the costs for three possible beautiful patterns: "abc", "acb", and "bac".

2. Precompute Costs: For each of the three patterns, compute the cost to transform the original string into each of these patterns. Create a 2D list `costs` where `costs[i][j]` represents the cost to transform the substring `s[0:j+1]` to match the pattern starting from the i-th character.

3. Query Processing: For each query, use the precomputed costs to calculate the minimum cost to transform the substring into a beautiful string. This can be achieved by comparing the costs for the three patterns.

4. Complexity: Precomputing the costs takes O(n) time for each pattern, resulting in O(3*n) = O(n) total time for preprocessing. Each query can be answered in O(1) time using the precomputed costs, resulting in O(m) time for all queries. Overall, the approach has a time complexity of O(n + m) and space complexity of O(n).

5. Implementation Steps:
   a. Read input values.
   b. Define the three possible beautiful patterns.
   c. Precompute the costs for transforming the string into each of the three patterns.
   d. For each query, calculate the minimum cost using the precomputed costs.
   e. Output the results for each query.
