1. Define the problem in terms of Dynamic Programming (DP) where we need to calculate the minimum cost to transform a substring into a "beautiful" string.
2. State expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the minimum cost to make the substring s[i:j+1] beautiful.
3. Base case: dp[i][i] = 0 for any i, as a single character is always beautiful.
4. Transition relation:
   - For each substring s[i:j+1] of length 2, if s[i] == s[i+1], then dp[i][i+1] = 1; otherwise dp[i][i+1] = 0.
   - For longer substrings, we need to consider all possible ways to split the substring into smaller parts and combine their results. Specifically, dp[i][j] = min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i+1][j-1] + (1 if s[i] == s[j] else 0)).
5. Precompute the dp table for all possible substrings of the given string s.
6. For each query, extract the precomputed result from the dp table.
7. Ensure the solution handles edge cases such as very short strings and queries that span the entire string.
8. Optimize the solution to handle the constraints efficiently by using appropriate data structures and minimizing redundant calculations.
