1. Define a "beautiful" string as one that does not contain a palindrome substring of length 2 or more.
2. Use a bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This approach involves filling up a table iteratively based on the results of smaller subproblems. It can be more intuitive and straightforward to implement, ensuring that all subproblems are solved in a structured manner. Time complexity: O(n + m * (r-l)), space complexity: O(n).
3. State expression: Create multiple precomputed arrays for the three possible "beautiful" patterns of length 3:
   - Pattern 1: "abcabcabc..."
   - Pattern 2: "acbacbacb..."
   - Pattern 3: "bacbacbac..."
4. Precompute the cost to transform the original string into each of these patterns for every prefix of the string.
5. For each query, calculate the cost to make the substring beautiful by evaluating the precomputed costs for the three patterns and selecting the minimum cost.
6. Output the minimum cost for each query.
