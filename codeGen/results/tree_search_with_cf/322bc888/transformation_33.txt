1. Define the problem as a dynamic programming problem.
2. Use a bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This approach involves filling up a table iteratively based on the results of smaller subproblems. It ensures that all subproblems are solved in a structured manner. Time complexity: O(n * m), space complexity: O(n * m).
3. State expression: Let dp[i][j] be the minimum cost to make the substring s[i:j] beautiful. Base case: dp[i][i] = 0 since a single character substring is inherently beautiful.
4. Transition: 
   - For each substring s[i:j], iterate over all possible split points k (i <= k < j) and calculate the cost to make both s[i:k] and s[k+1:j] beautiful.
   - Add the cost of changing the character at position k if it forms a palindrome with the next character.
5. Precompute the dp table for all possible substrings.
6. For each query, directly retrieve the cost from the dp table.
7. Handle edge cases such as single character substrings and substrings that are already beautiful.
