1. Define a "beautiful" string as one that does not contain a palindrome substring of length 2 or more.
2. Precompute the minimum cost to make any substring of length 1, 2, and 3 beautiful. Since there are only three characters ('a', 'b', 'c'), there are limited possible combinations for these lengths, making it feasible to precompute.
3. For substrings longer than 3, use the precomputed values to determine the minimum cost. A "beautiful" string can be one of the permutations of 'abc' repeated. There are 6 such permutations: "abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba".
4. For each query, determine the cost to transform the given substring into each of the 6 possible "beautiful" strings and select the minimum cost.
5. Use a sliding window approach to efficiently compute the transformation costs for each query.
6. For each query, output the minimum cost.
