1. State Definition: Let dp[i][j] represent the minimum cost to make the substring s[i:j] beautiful. Base Case: dp[i][i] = 0 since a single character substring is inherently beautiful.
2. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This approach involves filling up a table iteratively based on the results of smaller subproblems. It can be more intuitive and straightforward to implement, ensuring that all subproblems are solved in a structured manner. Time complexity: O(n * m), space complexity: O(n * m).
3. State expression: Let dp[i][j] be the minimum cost to make the substring s[i:j] beautiful. Base case: dp[i][i] = 0 since a single character substring is inherently beautiful.
4. Transition: To fill dp[i][j], we need to consider the cost of transforming s[i:j] such that no palindrome substrings of length 2 or more exist. This involves checking each possible transformation and updating the cost.
5. Preprocessing: Since the constraints are large, we need to preprocess the string to efficiently answer each query. We can create multiple possible beautiful strings of the same length and calculate the cost of transforming the original string into each of these beautiful strings.
6. Query Handling: For each query, use the precomputed costs to quickly determine the minimum cost to make the specified substring beautiful.
