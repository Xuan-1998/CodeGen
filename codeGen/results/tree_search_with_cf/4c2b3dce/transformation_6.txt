1. Initialize two boolean flags, found_AB and found_BA, to keep track of whether we have found the subsequences "AB" and "BA" respectively.
2. Iterate through the string s from the beginning to the second last character:
   - If s[i:i+2] == "AB":
     - If found_BA is already True, return "YES" because we found both "AB" and "BA" in non-overlapping positions.
     - Set found_AB to True and skip the next character by incrementing i to avoid overlapping.
   - If s[i:i+2] == "BA":
     - If found_AB is already True, return "YES" because we found both "BA" and "AB" in non-overlapping positions.
     - Set found_BA to True and skip the next character by incrementing i to avoid overlapping.
3. If the iteration completes without finding both subsequences in non-overlapping positions, return "NO".
