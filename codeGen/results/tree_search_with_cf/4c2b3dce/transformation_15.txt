===UPDATED PLAN===
1. Initialize two boolean variables found_AB and found_BA to False. These will track whether the subsequences "AB" and "BA" have been found in the string.

2. Iterate through the string from the beginning to the second last character:
   a. If the current character and the next character form the subsequence "AB":
      - If found_BA is already True, return "YES" because we have found both "AB" and "BA" in non-overlapping positions.
      - Otherwise, set found_AB to True and skip the next character to ensure non-overlapping.
   b. If the current character and the next character form the subsequence "BA":
      - If found_AB is already True, return "YES" because we have found both "BA" and "AB" in non-overlapping positions.
      - Otherwise, set found_BA to True and skip the next character to ensure non-overlapping.

3. If the loop completes without finding both subsequences, return "NO".

4. This approach ensures that we check for both "AB" and "BA" while maintaining non-overlapping conditions.

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
