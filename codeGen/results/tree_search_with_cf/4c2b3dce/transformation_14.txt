1. Initialize two boolean variables `found_AB` and `found_BA` to False. These will track whether we have found the subsequences "AB" and "BA" respectively.
2. Iterate through the string `s` from the first character to the second last character:
   a. If the current character and the next character form the substring "AB" and `found_BA` is False, set `found_AB` to True and skip the next character to ensure non-overlapping.
   b. If the current character and the next character form the substring "BA" and `found_AB` is False, set `found_BA` to True and skip the next character to ensure non-overlapping.
3. After the iteration, if both `found_AB` and `found_BA` are True, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".
Constraints: The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1).
