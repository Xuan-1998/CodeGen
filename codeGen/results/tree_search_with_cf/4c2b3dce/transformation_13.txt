1. Initialize two boolean variables found_AB and found_BA to False. These will track whether we have found the subsequences "AB" and "BA" respectively.
2. Traverse the string from left to right:
    - If the current character and the next character form "AB", and found_BA is True, return "YES".
    - If the current character and the next character form "BA", and found_AB is True, return "YES".
    - If the current character and the next character form "AB", set found_AB to True and skip the next character to ensure non-overlapping.
    - If the current character and the next character form "BA", set found_BA to True and skip the next character to ensure non-overlapping.
3. If the traversal completes without finding both subsequences, return "NO".
