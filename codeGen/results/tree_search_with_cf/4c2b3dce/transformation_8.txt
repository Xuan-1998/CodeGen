1. Initialize two flags: `found_AB` and `found_BA` to False. These flags will help track whether we have found the subsequences "AB" and "BA".
2. Traverse the string from left to right:
    a. If the current character and the next character form the subsequence "AB" and `found_BA` is True, print "YES" and exit.
    b. If the current character and the next character form the subsequence "BA" and `found_AB` is True, print "YES" and exit.
    c. If the current character and the next character form the subsequence "AB", set `found_AB` to True and skip the next character to ensure non-overlapping.
    d. If the current character and the next character form the subsequence "BA", set `found_BA` to True and skip the next character to ensure non-overlapping.
3. If the loop completes without finding both subsequences in a non-overlapping manner, print "NO".
