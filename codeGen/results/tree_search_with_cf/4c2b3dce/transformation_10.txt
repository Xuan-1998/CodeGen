1. Define two boolean variables `found_AB` and `found_BA` to keep track of whether we have found the subsequences "AB" and "BA" respectively. Initialize both to False.
2. Iterate through the string `s` from the beginning to the second-to-last character:
   a. If the current character and the next character form the subsequence "AB" and `found_BA` is True, return "YES".
   b. If the current character and the next character form the subsequence "BA" and `found_AB` is True, return "YES".
   c. If the current character and the next character form the subsequence "AB", set `found_AB` to True and skip the next character to avoid overlapping.
   d. If the current character and the next character form the subsequence "BA", set `found_BA` to True and skip the next character to avoid overlapping.
3. After the loop, if neither subsequence pair was found, return "NO".
