1. Initialize two boolean variables, found_AB and found_BA, to keep track of whether the subsequences "AB" and "BA" have been found, respectively. Set both to False initially.
2. Iterate through the string s using an index i from 0 to n-2 (since we are looking for pairs of characters).
3. Check for the subsequence "AB":
   a. If s[i] == 'A' and s[i+1] == 'B', set found_AB to True.
   b. If found_AB is True, continue to check for "BA" starting from the next character (i+2 onwards).
4. Check for the subsequence "BA":
   a. If s[i] == 'B' and s[i+1] == 'A', set found_BA to True.
   b. If found_BA is True, continue to check for "AB" starting from the next character (i+2 onwards).
5. If both found_AB and found_BA are True at any point, print "YES" and exit.
6. If the loop completes and either found_AB or found_BA is not True, print "NO".
