1. Initialize two boolean variables, found_AB and found_BA, to False. These will track whether the subsequences "AB" and "BA" have been found.
2. Iterate through the string s from the beginning to the end.
3. Check for the subsequence "AB":
   a. If the current character is 'A' and the next character is 'B', then set found_AB to True and skip the next character to avoid overlap.
4. Check for the subsequence "BA":
   a. If the current character is 'B' and the next character is 'A', then set found_BA to True and skip the next character to avoid overlap.
5. If both found_AB and found_BA are True at any point during the iteration, print "YES" and terminate the program.
6. If the iteration completes and either found_AB or found_BA is still False, print "NO".
