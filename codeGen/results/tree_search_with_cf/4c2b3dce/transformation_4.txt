1. Initialize variables to track the presence of "AB" and "BA" subsequences.
2. Iterate through the string to check for the presence of "AB" and "BA" in a non-overlapping manner.
3. Use two flags, `found_AB` and `found_BA`, to track whether "AB" and "BA" have been found, respectively.
4. Traverse the string from left to right:
    - If "AB" is found and `found_BA` is False, set `found_AB` to True and skip the next character to avoid overlap.
    - If "BA" is found and `found_AB` is False, set `found_BA` to True and skip the next character to avoid overlap.
5. If both `found_AB` and `found_BA` are True at any point, print "YES".
6. If the end of the string is reached and both subsequences are not found, print "NO".
