1. Initialize two boolean variables, found_AB and found_BA, to keep track of whether the subsequences "AB" and "BA" have been found in the string respectively. Set both to False initially.
2. Iterate through the string s from the beginning to the second last character.
3. For each character at position i:
   a. If the substring s[i:i+2] is "AB" and found_BA is True, return "YES" because we have found both subsequences "AB" and "BA" in the string.
   b. If the substring s[i:i+2] is "BA" and found_AB is True, return "YES" because we have found both subsequences "AB" and "BA" in the string.
   c. If the substring s[i:i+2] is "AB" and found_AB is False, set found_AB to True and skip the next character to ensure non-overlapping.
   d. If the substring s[i:i+2] is "BA" and found_BA is False, set found_BA to True and skip the next character to ensure non-overlapping.
4. If the loop completes without returning "YES", return "NO".
