The problem can be solved using a combination of both memoization and tabulation techniques, where the top-down approach is used to determine the optimal recoloring strategy, and the bottom-up approach is used to efficiently compute the minimum number of recolors.
DP states: The state can be defined as a tuple (i, c) where i is the current lamp index and c is the color of the previous lamp.
state = (lamp_index, prev_color), transition: dp[i][c] = min(dp[i-1][color]) + (1 if color != prev_color else 0)
To implement memoization by defining a dictionary to store the dynamic programming table and using it to look up previously computed values.
