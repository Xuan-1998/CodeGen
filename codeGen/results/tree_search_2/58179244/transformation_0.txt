Use a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization to store previously computed values, and recursively solve the problem for smaller subproblems.
The state expression could be dp[i][c], where dp[i][c] represents the minimum number of recolors needed to make the first i lamps diverse, given that the ith lamp is colored c. The base case would be when i = 0, and we would have dp[0][c] = 0 for any color c.
dp[i-1][c'] + (0 if s[i-1] == c' else 1), where c' is a color different from c and s[i-1] is the color of the (i-1)th lamp
Use dynamic programming with memoization to store previously computed values, by using a dictionary dp where dp[(i,c)] = min(dp[(i-1,d)]) + 1 if s[i] != c and d is different from c, and dp[(0,c)] = 0 for any color c.
