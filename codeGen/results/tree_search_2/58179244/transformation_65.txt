The problem can be solved using a combination of both memoization and tabulation techniques, where the top-down approach is used to determine the optimal recoloring strategy, and the bottom-up approach is used to efficiently compute the minimum number of recolors.
DP states: Define the state as a tuple (i, prev_color, curr_color) where i is the current lamp index, prev_color is the color of the previous lamp, and curr_color is the color of the current lamp.
Define the state as (i, prev_color) where i is the current lamp index and prev_color is the color of the previous lamp.
Use tabulation by creating a 2D array dp[i][prev_color] where dp[i][prev_color] represents the minimum number of recolors needed up to lamp i with the previous lamp having color prev_color.
