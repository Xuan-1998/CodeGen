The problem can be solved using a combination of both memoization and tabulation techniques, where the top-down approach is used to determine the optimal recoloring strategy, and the bottom-up approach is used to efficiently compute the minimum number of recolors.
DP states: The state can be defined as a pair (i, prev_color) where i is the current lamp index and prev_color is the color of the previous lamp.
The state can be defined as dp[i][c] = min_num_rec, where i is the current lamp index and c is a set containing the colors of the lamps from 0 to i
To implement memoization using a dictionary with (i, prev_color) as keys.
