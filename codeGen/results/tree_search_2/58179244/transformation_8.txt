Use a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization to store previously computed values, and recursively solve the problem for smaller subproblems.
dp[i][c] could represent the total number of distinct colors in the first i lamps, with the ith lamp being colored c. In this case, the base case would be when i = 1, where we would have dp[1][c] = 1 for each possible color c.
Consider using a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of recolors needed to make the first i lamps diverse if the last lamp has color j. The state would be (i, j) and the transition would be from state (i-1, k) for any k.
Dynamically construct a suffix tree or suffix automaton for the given string and then traverse it to find the minimum number of recolors required.
