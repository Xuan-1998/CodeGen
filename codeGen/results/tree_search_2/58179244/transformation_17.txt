Use a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization to store previously computed values, and recursively solve the problem for smaller subproblems.
Let's define dp[i][p] as a boolean indicating whether it's possible to make the first i lamps diverse with p recolors. The base case would then be when i = 0, where dp[0][p] is always False unless p is 0, in which case it's True.

Utilize a recursive function that stores its intermediate results in a memoization dictionary.
