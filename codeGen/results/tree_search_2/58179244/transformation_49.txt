The problem can be solved using a combination of both memoization and tabulation techniques, where the top-down approach is used to determine the optimal recoloring strategy, and the bottom-up approach is used to efficiently compute the minimum number of recolors.
DP states: The state can be defined as a tuple (i, c) where i is the current lamp index and c is the color of the previous lamp.
state = (lamp_index, prev_color), transition: dp[i][c] = min(dp[i-1][color]) + (1 if color != prev_color else 0)
To implement tabulation by initializing a 2D array dp with size n x 3, where each cell dp[i][c] represents the minimum number of recolors needed for the first i lamps ending with color c, and filling this array bottom-up.
