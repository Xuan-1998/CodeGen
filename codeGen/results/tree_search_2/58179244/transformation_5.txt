Use a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization to store previously computed values, and recursively solve the problem for smaller subproblems.
dp[i][c] could represent the total number of distinct colors in the first i lamps, with the ith lamp being colored c. In this case, the base case would be when i = 1, where we would have dp[1][c] = 1 for each possible color c.
dp[i][c] could represent the minimum number of recolors needed to make the first i lamps diverse, with the ith lamp being colored c.
