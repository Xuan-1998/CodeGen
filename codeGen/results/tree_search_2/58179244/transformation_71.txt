The problem can be solved using a combination of both memoization and tabulation techniques, where the top-down approach is used to determine the optimal recoloring strategy, and the bottom-up approach is used to efficiently compute the minimum number of recolors.
DP states: Define the state as a tuple (i, prev_color, curr_color) where i is the current lamp index, prev_color is the color of the previous lamp, and curr_color is the color of the current lamp.
Define the state as (i, prev_color, curr_color, recolor_count) where i is the current lamp index, prev_color is the color of the previous lamp, curr_color is the color of the current lamp, and recolor_count is the number of lamps that have been recolored.
dp_states = {(i, prev_color, curr_color): None for i in range(n+1) for prev_color in ['R', 'G', 'B'] for curr_color in ['R', 'G', 'B']}
