The problem can be solved using a combination of both memoization and tabulation techniques, where the top-down approach is used to determine the optimal recoloring strategy, and the bottom-up approach is used to efficiently compute the minimum number of recolors.
DP states: The state can be defined as a pair (i, prev_color) where i is the current lamp index and prev_color is the color of the previous lamp.
dp_state can be (n-1, prev_color), with transition relationship: dp_new_state = (i-1, color), if recoloring at i; or dp_new_state = (i-1, prev_color), if not recoloring at i
To implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach using a 2D table to store the minimum number of recolors needed for each subproblem.
