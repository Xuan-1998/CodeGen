The problem can be solved using a combination of both memoization and tabulation techniques, where the top-down approach is used to determine the optimal recoloring strategy, and the bottom-up approach is used to efficiently compute the minimum number of recolors.
DP states: Define the state as a tuple (i, prev_color, curr_color) where i is the current lamp index, prev_color is the color of the previous lamp, and curr_color is the color of the current lamp.
Define the state as (i, curr_color) where i is the current lamp index and curr_color is the color of the current lamp.
Tabulation can be implemented by iterating over all possible lamp indices i and colors curr_color, and updating the table dp[i][curr_color] with the minimum number of recolors needed to obtain a diverse garland up to index i with the current lamp having color curr_color.
