Use a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization to store previously computed values, and recursively solve the problem for smaller subproblems.
Let's define dp[i][p] as a boolean indicating whether it's possible to make the first i lamps diverse with p recolors. The base case would then be when i = 0, where dp[0][p] is always False unless p is 0, in which case it's True.
dp[i][j] can be set to True if the i-th lamp's color is different from the previous one and j is equal to the number of recolors needed to make the first i-1 lamps diverse plus 1.
Employ a combination of memoization and tabulation, where memoization is used for the recursive function calls and tabulation is used to pre-compute and store the results for smaller subproblems.
