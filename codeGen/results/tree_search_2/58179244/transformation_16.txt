Use a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization to store previously computed values, and recursively solve the problem for smaller subproblems.
Let's define dp[i][p] as a boolean indicating whether it's possible to make the first i lamps diverse with p recolors. The base case would then be when i = 0, where dp[0][p] is always False unless p is 0, in which case it's True.

Use a 2D list to store the dynamic programming table and fill it in a bottom-up manner from left to right and top to bottom.
