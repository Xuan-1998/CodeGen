The problem can be solved using a combination of both memoization and tabulation techniques, where the top-down approach is used to determine the optimal recoloring strategy, and the bottom-up approach is used to efficiently compute the minimum number of recolors.
DP states: The state can be defined as a tuple (i, c) where i is the current lamp index and c is the color of the previous lamp.
state = dp[i], transition: dp[i] = sum(1 for c in colors[:i+1] if c != colors[i-1]) if i > 0 else 0
You can use memoization to store the intermediate results of the dynamic programming table, which would require a recursive function with a base case and an inductive case.
