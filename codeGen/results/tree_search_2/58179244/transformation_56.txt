The problem can be solved using a combination of both memoization and tabulation techniques, where the top-down approach is used to determine the optimal recoloring strategy, and the bottom-up approach is used to efficiently compute the minimum number of recolors.
DP states: The state can be defined as a pair (i, prev_color) where i is the current lamp index and prev_color is the color of the previous lamp.
The state can be defined as s_i = (i, c_{i-1}), where i is the current lamp index and c_{i-1} is the color of the previous lamp.
To implement tabulation, we can use a 2D array dp where dp[i][c] represents the minimum number of recolors needed to obtain a diverse garland from the first i lamps with color c. We initialize dp[0][c] = 0 for all colors c and then fill up the dp table using a bottom-up approach.
