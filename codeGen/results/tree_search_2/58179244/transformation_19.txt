Use a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization to store previously computed values, and recursively solve the problem for smaller subproblems.
Let's define dp[i][p] as a boolean indicating whether it's possible to make the first i lamps diverse with p recolors. The base case would then be when i = 0, where dp[0][p] is always False unless p is 0, in which case it's True.
Let's define dp[i][j] as a boolean indicating whether there are j ways to make the first i lamps diverse. Then, we can set dp[i][j] to be True if dp[i-1][k] and s[i-1] is different from s[i-2] for some k less than or equal to j, where s[i] is the color of the i-th lamp.
Applying dynamic programming principles by creating a 2D array dp[][] where dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to make the first i lamps diverse with j recolors, and updating dp[i][j] based on dp[i-1][k] for some k less than or equal to j.
