Compare suffixes of str1 and prefixes of str2 to find overlapping subproblems.
DP[i][j] is the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i-1 and j-1 in str1 and str2.
Consider a 3D DP table, where DP[i][j][k] is the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i-1, j-1, and k in str1 and str2. The transition relationship can be defined based on whether the characters at indices i, j, and k are matching or not.
Implement memoization using a dictionary where keys are tuples representing (i, j, k) indices and values are the computed DP[i][j][k] values to avoid redundant calculations.
