Compare suffixes of str1 and prefixes of str2 to find overlapping subproblems.
DP[i][j] is the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i-1 and j-1 in str1 and str2.
Consider a 3D DP table, where DP[i][j][k] is the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i-1, j-1, and k in str1 and str2. The transition relationship can be defined based on whether the characters at indices i, j, and k are matching or not.
Employ tabulation by initializing the DP table with base cases (e.g., DP[0][j][k] = 0 for all j and k), then iteratively fill the table using a loop that considers character matching or non-matching conditions.
