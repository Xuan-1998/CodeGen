Compare suffixes of str1 and prefixes of str2 to find overlapping subproblems.
DP[i][j] is 1 if the substring from index i to j in both strings are equal, otherwise it's the maximum value from the left or top cell plus 1.
DP[i][j] is 1 if the substring from index i to j in both strings are equal, otherwise it's the maximum value from the top cell plus 1.
Create a DP table using nested loops with row and column indices.
