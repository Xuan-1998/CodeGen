Compare suffixes of str1 and prefixes of str2 to find overlapping subproblems.
DP[i][j] is 1 if the substring from index i to j in both strings are equal, otherwise it's the maximum value from the left or top cell plus 1.
DP[i][j] represents the length of the longest common suffix ending at index i and the longest common prefix starting at index j. If they match, increment by 1. Otherwise, take the minimum from left or top.
Use a Trie data structure to store the substrings in both strings and then iterate through them to count common non-overlapping substrings
