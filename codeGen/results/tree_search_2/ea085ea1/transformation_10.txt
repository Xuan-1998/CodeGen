Compare suffixes of str1 and prefixes of str2 to find overlapping subproblems.
DP[i][j] is 1 if the substring from index i to j in both strings are equal, otherwise it's the maximum value from the left or top cell plus 1.
DP[i][j] is the maximum number of non-overlapping common substrings found so far between the first i characters of str1 and the last j characters of str2.
Implement memoization using a dictionary where keys are tuples (i, j) and values are the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far.
