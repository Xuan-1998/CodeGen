Compare suffixes of str1 and prefixes of str2 to find overlapping subproblems.
DP[i][j] is the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i-1 and j-1 in str1 and str2.
DP[i][j] is the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i-1 and j-1 in str1 and str2. The transition relationship can be defined based on whether the characters at indices i and j are matching or not.
Use a 2D array to store DP values for memoization
