The dynamic programming solution involves identifying common substrings between str1 and str2, where each substring is a state in the DP table. The transition relationships can be defined based on whether two substrings have any common characters.
The state expression could be the pair of substrings (str1[i..j], str2[k..l]), where i, j, k, l are integers representing the start and end indices of the substrings.
Consider the substrings as hash values, where the state is represented by a tuple of two strings. The transition relationship can be defined as: if there exists a common substring between str1 and str2 with hash value h, then there is an edge from state s to state t, where s and t are states represented by their corresponding substrings.
Design a 2D table where rows represent indices in str1, columns represent indices in str2, and cells store counts of common non-overlapping substrings.
