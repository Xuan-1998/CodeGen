Compare suffixes of str1 and prefixes of str2 to find overlapping subproblems.
DP[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i and j in str1 and str2.
DP[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i in str1 and j in str2, where it considers all possible previous substrings ending up to i-1 in str1 and j-1 in str2. If a common substring is found, then DP[i][j] is updated with max(DP[i-1][j-1] + 1, DP[i-1][j]) or similar recursive relationships.
Implement memoization using a dictionary where the key is a tuple of (i, j) and the value is the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings.
