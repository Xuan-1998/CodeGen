Compare suffixes of str1 and prefixes of str2 to find overlapping subproblems.
DP[i][j] is the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i-1 and j-1 in str1 and str2.
Consider a 3D DP table, where DP[i][j][k] is the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i-1, j-1, and k in str1 and str2. The transition relationship can be defined based on whether the characters at indices i, j, and k are matching or not.
Use a 3D DP table with dimensions N x N x 3 to store the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at each position in str1 and str2, considering matching or non-matching characters.
