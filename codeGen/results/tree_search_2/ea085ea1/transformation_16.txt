Compare suffixes of str1 and prefixes of str2 to find overlapping subproblems.
DP[i][j] is the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i-1 and j-1 in str1 and str2.
DP[i][j] is the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i-1 and j-1 in str1 and str2. The transition relationship can be defined based on whether the characters at indices i and j are matching or not.
Implement dynamic programming with two nested loops, one iterating over str1 and the other over str2
