Compare suffixes of str1 and prefixes of str2 to find overlapping subproblems.
DP[i][j] is the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i-1 and j-1 in str1 and str2.
Compare the longest common prefix (LCP) between suffixes of str1 and prefixes of str2, and use it as the DP state.
Implement top-down memoization using a dictionary to store the computed LCP values.
