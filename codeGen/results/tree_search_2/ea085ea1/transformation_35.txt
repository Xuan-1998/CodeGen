The dynamic programming solution involves identifying common substrings between str1 and str2, where each substring is a state in the DP table. The transition relationships can be defined based on whether two substrings have any common characters.
A state could represent whether str1[i..j] is equal to str2[k..l], and the base case would be when two substrings are not equal.
State could represent a pair of (i, j) and (k, l) indices in str1 and str2 respectively, where the DP table value at this state is the count of common non-overlapping substrings ending at these positions.
Implement tabulation by iterating over all possible lengths of common substrings and for each length, iterate over all possible starting positions in both strings.
