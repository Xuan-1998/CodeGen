The dynamic programming solution involves identifying common substrings between str1 and str2, where each substring is a state in the DP table. The transition relationships can be defined based on whether two substrings have any common characters.
A state could represent whether str1[i..j] is equal to str2[k..l], and the base case would be when two substrings are not equal.
State could represent whether str1[i..j] is equal to str2[k..l], and the transition relationship can be defined based on whether two substrings have any common characters. The base case would be when two substrings are not equal.
Employ memoization to optimize the search for common substrings by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when needed.
