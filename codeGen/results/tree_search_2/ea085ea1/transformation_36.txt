The dynamic programming solution involves identifying common substrings between str1 and str2, where each substring is a state in the DP table. The transition relationships can be defined based on whether two substrings have any common characters.
A state could represent whether str1[i..j] is equal to str2[k..l], and the base case would be when two substrings are not equal.

Use a 3D DP table to store the presence of substrings in both strings and update based on common characters.
