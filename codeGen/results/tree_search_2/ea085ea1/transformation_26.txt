The dynamic programming solution involves identifying common substrings between str1 and str2, where each substring is a state in the DP table. The transition relationships can be defined based on whether two substrings have any common characters.
The state expression could be the pair of substrings (str1[i..j], str2[k..l]), where i, j, k, l are integers representing the start and end indices of the substrings.
The transition relationship can be defined as: if there is at least one common character between str1[i..j] and str2[k..l], then there is a connection from state (str1[m..n], str2[p..q]) to state (str1[i..j], str2[k..l]), otherwise, no connection.
