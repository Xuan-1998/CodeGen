Compare suffixes of str1 and prefixes of str2 to find overlapping subproblems.
DP[i][j] is the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at indices i-1 and j-1 in str1 and str2.
Compare the longest common prefix (LCP) between suffixes of str1 and prefixes of str2, and use it as the DP state.
Use a suffix tree data structure to efficiently compute the LCP values.
