The dynamic programming solution involves identifying common substrings between str1 and str2, where each substring is a state in the DP table. The transition relationships can be defined based on whether two substrings have any common characters.
The state expression could be the length of the longest common substring ending at index i in either string, with a base case being when the substring is empty or reaches the end of one of the strings.
The state expression could be the number of non-overlapping common substrings of a given length that can be formed by considering all possible pairs of characters from str1 and str2
Memoize the function that calculates the number of common substrings for a given prefix in both strings
