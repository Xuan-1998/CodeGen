The dynamic programming solution involves identifying common substrings between str1 and str2, where each substring is a state in the DP table. The transition relationships can be defined based on whether two substrings have any common characters.
The state expression could be the pair of substrings (str1[i..j], str2[k..l]), where i, j, k, l are integers representing the start and end indices of the substrings.
Choose a state as the pair of non-overlapping substrings (str1[i..j], str2[k..l]), where i, j, k, l are integers representing the start and end indices of the substrings.
Implement memoization using a dictionary to store the dynamic programming values, where each key is a state (str1[0..i], str2[0..k]) and the value is the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings.
