Consider using dynamic programming with a 2D array to store the minimum and maximum number of recomputations for each vertex, where the state represents the current vertex and the previous path.
The state expression is (prev_v, prev_path) where prev_v is the last vertex in the path and prev_path is the sequence of vertices up to prev_v.
The dynamic programming state can be formulated as (v, rec_min, rec_max) where v is the current vertex and rec_min and rec_max are the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path from v to t needs to be recomputed.
Use a dictionary memo where keys are tuples (prev_v, prev_path) and values are tuples (rec_min, rec_max) representing the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path from v to t needs to be recomputed given that the previous vertex is prev_v and the previous path is prev_path.
