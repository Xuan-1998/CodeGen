Explore the idea of using a priority queue to maintain the shortest distance from each vertex to t and update the minimum and maximum number of recomputations based on the path recomputation.
State: dp[i] = number of times the shortest path from vertex i to t needs to be recomputed
dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1, j in path from s to i) for all vertices j in the fixed path
Use memoization with a dictionary to store the minimum and maximum number of recomputations for each vertex, updating it based on the path recomputation.
