Consider using dynamic programming with a 2D array to store the minimum and maximum number of recomputations for each vertex, where the state represents the current vertex and the previous path.
Define the state as a single variable 'v' representing the current vertex and the base case is when v equals t since there's no need to recalculate at this point.
Define the state as a dictionary d where d[v] stores the minimum and maximum number of recomputations for each vertex v.
Use 2D array dp[][] with states (v, path_length) to store the minimum and maximum number of recomputations for each vertex.
