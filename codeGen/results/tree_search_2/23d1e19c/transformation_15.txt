Consider using dynamic programming with a 2D array to store the minimum and maximum number of recomputations for each vertex, where the state represents the current vertex and the previous path.
Define the state as a single variable 'v' representing the current vertex and the base case is when v equals t since there's no need to recalculate at this point.
The state can be represented as an integer 'dist' which represents the distance from the current vertex to t, along with an additional variable 'count' to keep track of the number of times the shortest path needs to be recalculated.
Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary to store the state value and return the minimum and maximum number of recomputations for each vertex.
