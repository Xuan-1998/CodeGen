Consider using dynamic programming with a 2D array to store the minimum and maximum number of recomputations for each vertex, where the state represents the current vertex and the previous path.
Define the state as a single variable 'v' representing the current vertex and the base case is when v equals t since there's no need to recalculate at this point.
The state can be represented as a tuple (v, path), where v is the current vertex and path is a list of previous vertices in the fixed path.
Dynamically build up an array dp by iterating through all vertices in the graph and updating dp[v][p] based on the state (v, p) and the minimum and maximum values from previous states.
