This code first constructs the graph using the edge list and then uses a disjoint set data structure to keep track of connected components. Then it simulates recomputing shortest paths by traversing the fixed path from $s$ to $t$. For each vertex in the fixed path, it checks if recomputation is needed and updates the minimum and maximum number of times recomputation is needed.

The problem really asks you to find the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path from the current vertex to $t$ needs to be recomputed. The answer lies in simulating this process by keeping track of connected components using a disjoint set data structure.

This code receives inputs from stdin, constructs the graph and fixed path, and then prints the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path from the current vertex to $t$ needs to be recomputed.
