Consider using dynamic programming with a 2D array to store the minimum and maximum number of recomputations for each vertex, where the state represents the current vertex and the previous path.
The state expression is (prev_v, prev_path) where prev_v is the last vertex in the path and prev_path is the sequence of vertices up to prev_v.
The dynamic programming state can be formulated as (v, path) where v is the current vertex and path is the list of vertices from s to t including v.
Store the previous state in a dictionary for efficient lookup.
