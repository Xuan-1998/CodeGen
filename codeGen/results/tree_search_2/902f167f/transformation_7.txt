The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as finding the minimum number of squares that tile a rectangle of size n x m-1. The optimal substructure is that the solution to the larger problem can be constructed from the solutions of the smaller subproblems.
The state expression could be 'dp[i][j]' where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares that tile a rectangle of size i x j.
dp[i][j] could be the minimum number of squares with sides up to min(i, j), such that each square covers a contiguous area in the rectangle.
Determine whether a square with side length k can be placed at position (i, j) in the rectangle, and update dp[i-k][j-k] accordingly.
