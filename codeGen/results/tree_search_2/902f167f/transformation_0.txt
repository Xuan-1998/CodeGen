The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as finding the minimum number of squares that tile a rectangle of size n x m-1. The optimal substructure is that the solution to the larger problem can be constructed from the solutions of the smaller subproblems.
The state expression could be 'dp[i][j]' where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares that tile a rectangle of size i x j.
dp[i][j] can be the minimum number of squares that tile a rectangle of size i x j, with the base case being when i or j is 0.
Use bottom-up dynamic programming by initializing an n x m grid with zeros and filling it up row by row, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares that tile a rectangle of size i x j.
