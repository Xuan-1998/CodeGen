It's possible to use dynamic programming with tabulation by iterating over all possible values of n and m, and for each value, computing the minimum number of squares that tile the rectangle, and then storing this result in a 2D array.
The base case is when i == 1, in which case the only possible square is a single unit square, so dp[1][j] = 1 for all j.
The transition relationship can be formulated as dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k]+dp[1][j-k] for k in range(1, j+1))
Use a 2D array to store the minimum number of squares that tile the rectangle, with the base case being when i == 1 and dp[1][j] = 1 for all j.
