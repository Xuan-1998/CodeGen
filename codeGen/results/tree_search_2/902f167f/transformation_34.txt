The problem has overlapping subproblems because the same subproblem may be encountered multiple times during the computation, and it would be efficient to store the results of these subproblems in a memoization table.
The state expression could be dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of integer-sided squares that can fit in an i x j rectangle with sides parallel to the original sides. The base case would be when i < 2 or j < 2, where the minimum number is either 1 (if the rectangle is too small) or the maximum possible value.
dp[i][j] = 1 if i < 2 or j < 2 else min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + (i > 0 and j > 0) * 1
You could also consider using dynamic programming with a 2D array to store the state values and transition equations, where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of integer-sided squares that can fit in an i x j rectangle.
