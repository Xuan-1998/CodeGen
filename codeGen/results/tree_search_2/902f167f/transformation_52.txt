It's possible to use dynamic programming with tabulation by iterating over all possible values of n and m, and for each value, computing the minimum number of squares that tile the rectangle, and then storing this result in a 2D array.
The base case is when i == 1, in which case the only possible square is a single unit square, so dp[1][j] = 1 for all j.
The state can be defined as (i, j) representing the minimum number of squares that tile a rectangle of size i x j.
Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming values and initialize it with zeros.
