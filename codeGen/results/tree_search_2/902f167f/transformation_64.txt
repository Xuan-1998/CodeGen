It's possible to use dynamic programming with tabulation by iterating over all possible values of n and m, and for each value, computing the minimum number of squares that tile the rectangle, and then storing this result in a 2D array.
The base case is when i == 1 or j == 1, in which case there are no possible squares, so dp[i][0] = dp[0][j] = 0 for all i and j.
dp[i][j] is the minimum number of squares that tile a rectangle of size i x (i + k) when k satisfies 1 <= k <= m
Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares that tile a rectangle of size i x (i + j).
