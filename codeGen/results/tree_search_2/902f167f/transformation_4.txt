The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as finding the minimum number of squares that tile a rectangle of size n x m-1. The optimal substructure is that the solution to the larger problem can be constructed from the solutions of the smaller subproblems.
The state expression could be 'dp[i][j]' where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares that tile a rectangle of size i x j.
Consider 'dp[i-1][j]' and 'dp[i][j-1]' as intermediate states, which represent the minimum number of squares that tile rectangles of size (i-1) x j and i x (j-1) respectively. Then, the transition relationship can be expressed as dp[i][j] being the minimum of these two values plus one.
Use memoization by creating a function that takes n and m as input and returns the minimum number of squares that tile the rectangle, using the previously computed values in the table to avoid redundant computations.
