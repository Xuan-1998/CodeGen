The problem has overlapping subproblems because the same subproblem may be encountered multiple times during the computation, and it would be efficient to store the results of these subproblems in a memoization table.
The state expression could be dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of integer-sided squares that can fit in an i x j rectangle with sides parallel to the original sides. The base case would be when i < 2 or j < 2, where the minimum number is either 1 (if the rectangle is too small) or the maximum possible value.
dp[i][j] = min(1 + dp[min(i, k)][min(j, l)] + dp[max(0, i-k)][max(0, j-l)]) for k in range(1, i+1) and l in range(1, j+1)
Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table with initialization dp[i][j] = min(1 + dp[min(i, k)][min(j, l)] + dp[max(0, i-k)][max(0, j-l)]) for k in range(1, i+1) and l in range(1, j+1);
