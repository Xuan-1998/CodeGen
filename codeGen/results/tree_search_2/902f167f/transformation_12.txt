The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as finding the minimum number of squares that tile a rectangle of size n x m-1. The optimal substructure is that the solution to the larger problem can be constructed from the solutions of the smaller subproblems.
The base case could be when i == 1 or j == 1, in which case the answer is simply the maximum of i and j.
Consider a rectangle of size n x m, where we can place squares on top or to the right. Define a function f(i, j) that returns the minimum number of squares needed to tile the remaining rectangle of size i x (m-j). The state is dp[i][j] = f(i-1, j) + 1, and the transition relationship could be dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1.
Memoize the function f(i, j) using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems as they are computed.
