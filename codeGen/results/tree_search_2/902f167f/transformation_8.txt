The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as finding the minimum number of squares that tile a rectangle of size n x m-1. The optimal substructure is that the solution to the larger problem can be constructed from the solutions of the smaller subproblems.
The base case could be when i == 1 or j == 1, in which case the answer is simply the maximum of i and j.
Let's define a function dp[i][j] that represents the minimum number of squares needed to tile a rectangle of size i x j. The state is dp[i][j], and the transition relationship could be dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-k] + 1) for k in range(j).
Implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table with size (n+1) x (m+1), where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares needed to tile a rectangle of size i x j.
