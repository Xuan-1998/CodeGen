It's possible to use dynamic programming with tabulation by iterating over all possible values of n and m, and for each value, computing the minimum number of squares that tile the rectangle, and then storing this result in a 2D array.
Let the state be dp[i][j], representing the minimum number of squares that tile a rectangle of size i x j.
dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares that can cover an area of (i-1) x (j-1). For a given i and j, we need to find the minimum number of squares that can cover the area from 0 to i-1 in the horizontal direction and from 0 to j-1 in the vertical direction. The transition relationship is then dp[i][j] = min(dp[i/k][j/l] + 1) for k from 1 to sqrt(i) and l from 1 to sqrt(j).
Implement bottom-up dynamic programming by initializing dp[0][j] = 1 for all j, since a rectangle of width 0 can be covered with one square, then fill up the rest of the dp array in a way that each cell is dependent on its top-left cells.
