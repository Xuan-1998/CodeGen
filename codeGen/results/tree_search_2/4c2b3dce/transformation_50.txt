Determine if 'A' or 'B' appears more frequently in the string, then use this information to decide whether the string contains both substrings.
When i = 0, the base case is True (assuming an empty string contains both substrings).
Neither 'A' nor 'B' appears in the current prefix
Determine the maximum gap between consecutive appearances of characters 'A' and 'B', and check if this gap is sufficient for both substrings to coexist.
