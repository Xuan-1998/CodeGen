Determine if 'A' or 'B' appears more frequently in the string, then use this information to decide whether the string contains both substrings.
The state expression is dp[i], where i is the length of the current string prefix.
dp[i] = {'A': sum(1 for c in s[:i] if c == 'A'), 'B': sum(1 for c in s[:i] if c == 'B')} and check if both counts are greater than 0.
Create a 2D array where dp[i][j] is the maximum frequency of 'A' and 'B' in the first i characters and j substrings.
