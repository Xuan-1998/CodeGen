Check if 'AB' appears in the string, then check if the remaining part contains 'BA'.
Consider the substring of s that ends at index i: Define the state as a boolean indicating whether the first 'A' has been found in this substring, and the base case is when i = 0.
'A' seen if the current character is 'A', 'B' seen if the current character is 'B', and none of them are seen otherwise.
Dynamically build the 2D array by iterating over the string and updating the states based on the current character.
