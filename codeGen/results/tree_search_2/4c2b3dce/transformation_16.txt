Check if 'AB' appears in the string, then check if the remaining part contains 'BA'.
Let dp[i] be true if s[0..i-1] contains both 'AB' and 'BA', otherwise false; define the state as dp[i], and the base case is dp[0] = True.
dp[i] = (i >= 3) and (s[i-2:i] == 'BA') and ((i >= 6) and (s[i-5:i-2] == 'AB'))
Create a dynamic programming array dp of size n+1, where n is the length of string s, initialized with all False values.
