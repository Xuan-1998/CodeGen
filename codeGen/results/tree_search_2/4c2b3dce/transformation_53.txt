Determine if 'A' or 'B' appears more frequently in the string, then use this information to decide whether the string contains both substrings.
The state expression and base case are related by dp[i] being True if either 'AB' or 'BA' appears in s[:i], and False otherwise.
The state is an integer representing the number of times 'A' or 'B' has been seen so far, and the transition relation is that this state increments by 1 for each new occurrence of 'A' or 'B', with a base case when the state reaches 2 and indicates that both substrings have appeared.
Use dynamic programming to create a 2D table where dp[i][0] is True if s[:i] contains 'AB' and False otherwise, and dp[i][1] is True if s[:i] contains 'BA' and False otherwise.
