Check if 'AB' appears in the string, then check if the remaining part contains 'BA'.
Let dp[i] be true if s[0..i-1] contains both 'AB' and 'BA', otherwise false; define the state as dp[i], and the base case is dp[0] = True.
dp[i] = dp[j] for some j < i such that s[0:j] contains both 'AB' and 'BA', then check if s[j:i] contains one of them
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach, where dp[i] is the minimum value required to reach index i.
