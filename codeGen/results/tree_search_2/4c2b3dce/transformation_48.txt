Determine if 'A' or 'B' appears more frequently in the string, then use this information to decide whether the string contains both substrings.
When i = 0, the base case is True (assuming an empty string contains both substrings).
Neither 'A' nor 'B' appears in the current prefix
Check for presence of substring 'AB' and then use this to determine if the remaining part of the string can contain 'BA'.
