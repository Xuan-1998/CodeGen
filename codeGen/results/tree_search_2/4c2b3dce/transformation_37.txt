Determine if 'A' or 'B' appears more frequently in the string, then use this information to decide whether the string contains both substrings.
The state expression is dp[i], where i is the length of the current string prefix.
dp[i] = True if 'A' appears more frequently in the string[:i], False otherwise.
Create a dynamic programming table with initial values dp[0] = 1 (since we can't find any substrings of length 0) and dp[i] = 0 for i > 0.
