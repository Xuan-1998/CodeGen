Determine if 'A' or 'B' appears more frequently in the string, then use this information to decide whether the string contains both substrings.
Let dp[i] represent whether s[:i] has a substring 'AB' or 'BA'. If neither, then dp[i] is False.
Think about the number of 'A's and 'B's in the string, if one appears more frequently than the other, then the other must appear in a specific way.
Determine the first occurrence of either 'A' or 'B', then check if the remaining part of the string contains the other substring.
