Determine if 'A' or 'B' appears more frequently in the string, then use this information to decide whether the string contains both substrings.
Let dp[i] represent whether s[:i] has a substring 'AB' or 'BA'. If neither, then dp[i] is False.
Consider two states: 1) the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA', and 2) it doesn't contain either substring.
for i in range(len(s)-1): dp.append((s[:i+1].count('A') > s[:i+1].count('B')) != (s[i+1:].count('A') < s[i+1:].count('B'))
