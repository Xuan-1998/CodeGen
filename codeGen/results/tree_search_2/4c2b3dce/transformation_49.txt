Determine if 'A' or 'B' appears more frequently in the string, then use this information to decide whether the string contains both substrings.
When i = 0, the base case is True (assuming an empty string contains both substrings).
Neither 'A' nor 'B' appears in the current prefix
Use dynamic programming to compute the number of occurrences of each character in the string, and then decide based on the counts.
