Determine if 'A' or 'B' appears more frequently in the string, then use this information to decide whether the string contains both substrings.
When i = 0, the base case is True (assuming an empty string contains both substrings).
The number of 'A's in the current prefix is one more than the number of 'B's
Check if the count of 'A' and 'B' are equal
