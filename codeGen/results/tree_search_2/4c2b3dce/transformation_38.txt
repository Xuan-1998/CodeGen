Determine if 'A' or 'B' appears more frequently in the string, then use this information to decide whether the string contains both substrings.
The state expression is dp[i], where i is the length of the current string prefix.
dp[i] = True if 'A' appears more frequently in the string[:i], False otherwise.
Use memoization to store the count of 'A' or 'B' in the string[:i], then use this information to determine if the string contains both substrings.
