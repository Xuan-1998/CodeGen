Determine if 'A' or 'B' appears more frequently in the string, then use this information to decide whether the string contains both substrings.
When i = 0, the base case is True (assuming an empty string contains both substrings).
The number of 'A's in the current prefix equals the number of 'B's
Use two pointers, one starting from the beginning of the string and one from the end. Move the pointers towards each other. If an 'A' is encountered before a 'B', increment the first pointer. If a 'B' is encountered before an 'A', decrement the second pointer. When both pointers meet, check if the remaining characters are in order to determine if the string contains both substrings.
