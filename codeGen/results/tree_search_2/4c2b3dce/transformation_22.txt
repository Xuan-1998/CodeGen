Split the string into two parts at a random position, check if one part is 'AB' and the other part is 'BA', then recursively split the remaining parts.
dp[i][j] = 1 if there exists a pair of indices k, l such that i <= k < l <= j and s[k...k+2] is 'AB' and s[l-2...l] is 'BA'. Otherwise, dp[i][j] = 0.
Determine if there are two non-overlapping substrings 'AB' and 'BA' by iterating through all possible pairs of positions in the string, checking if the substring from i to i+2 is 'AB' and the substring from j-2 to j is 'BA',
Check for overlapping substrings using a dynamic programming approach
