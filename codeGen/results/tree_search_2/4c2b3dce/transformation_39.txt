Determine if 'A' or 'B' appears more frequently in the string, then use this information to decide whether the string contains both substrings.
The state expression is dp[i], where i is the length of the current string prefix.
dp[i] = {'A': sum(1 for c in s[:i] if c == 'A'), 'B': sum(1 for c in s[:i] if c == 'B')} and check if both counts are greater than 0.
Use a dictionary to store the count of characters, then check if both counts are greater than 0.
