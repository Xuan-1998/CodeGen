Determine if 'A' or 'B' appears more frequently in the string, then use this information to decide whether the string contains both substrings.
Let dp[i] represent whether s[:i] has a substring 'AB' or 'BA'. If neither, then dp[i] is False.
Consider two states: 1) the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA', and 2) it doesn't contain either substring.
dp[i] = any(s[:i].endswith('A') and s[i:].startswith('B')) or any(s[:i].endswith('B') and s[i:].startswith('A'))
