Check if 'AB' appears in the string, then check if the remaining part contains 'BA'.
Consider the substring of s that ends at index i: Define the state as a boolean indicating whether the first 'A' has been found in this substring, and the base case is when i = 0.
Consider two states: one for 'A' being seen, and another for 'B' being seen.
Check if 'AB' appears as a suffix of the string.
