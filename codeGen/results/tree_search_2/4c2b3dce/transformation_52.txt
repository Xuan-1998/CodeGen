Determine if 'A' or 'B' appears more frequently in the string, then use this information to decide whether the string contains both substrings.
The state expression and base case are related by dp[i] being True if either 'AB' or 'BA' appears in s[:i], and False otherwise.
The state is a boolean indicating whether the string contains both substrings up to the current position, and the transition relation is that this state becomes True if either 'AB' or 'BA' appears in the remaining part of the string.
Initialize a variable max_freq to the frequency of 'A' or 'B', then use this information to decide whether the string contains both substrings. Use tabulation to fill up the dp array
