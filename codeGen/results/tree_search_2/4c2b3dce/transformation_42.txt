Determine if 'A' or 'B' appears more frequently in the string, then use this information to decide whether the string contains both substrings.
When i = 0, the base case is True (assuming an empty string contains both substrings).
The number of 'A's in the current prefix equals the number of 'B's
Create a boolean array to keep track of whether each character is an 'A' or a 'B', then use this information to decide which substring appears first and how many times it appears.
