Determine if 'A' or 'B' appears more frequently in the string, then use this information to decide whether the string contains both substrings.
The state expression and base case are related by dp[i] being True if either 'AB' or 'BA' appears in s[:i], and False otherwise.
The state is a boolean indicating whether the string contains both substrings up to the current position, and the transition relation is that this state becomes True if either 'AB' or 'BA' appears in the remaining part of the string.
Use a boolean array dp of size len(s) to keep track of whether the substring s[:i] contains both substrings, and update it by checking if either 'AB' or 'BA' appears in s[i:]
