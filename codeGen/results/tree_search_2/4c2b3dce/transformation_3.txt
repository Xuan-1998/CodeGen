Check if 'AB' appears in the string, then check if the remaining part contains 'BA'.
Consider the substring of s that ends at index i: Define the state as a boolean indicating whether the first 'A' has been found in this substring, and the base case is when i = 0.
'A' seen if the current character is 'A', 'B' seen if the current character is 'B', and none of them are seen otherwise.
Create a 2D array to store the dynamic programming states for each substring, with the first dimension representing the index i and the second dimension representing whether 'A' has been seen.
