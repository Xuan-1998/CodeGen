Determine if 'A' or 'B' appears more frequently in the string, then use this information to decide whether the string contains both substrings.
Let dp[i] represent whether s[:i] has a substring 'AB' or 'BA'. If neither, then dp[i] is False.
Determine if there is an 'A' followed by a 'B' or vice versa, and use this information to decide whether the string contains both substrings.
Use a sliding window approach to check for 'A' followed by 'B' or vice versa
