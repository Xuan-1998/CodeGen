Check if 'AB' appears in the string, then check if the remaining part contains 'BA'.
Consider the substring of s that ends at index i: Define the state as a boolean indicating whether the first 'A' has been found in this substring, and the base case is when i = 0.
'A' seen if the current character is 'A', 'B' seen if the current character is 'B', and none of them are seen otherwise.
Define a function that takes an index i and returns True if the substring from 0 to i contains 'AB', and False otherwise.
