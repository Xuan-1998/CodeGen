The problem can be solved by solving smaller instances of the same problem and combining their solutions to solve the original problem, so use bottom-up approach with tabulation.
The state transition relation is dp[i][j+1] = ..., given dp[i][j].
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] if i == 0 or j == 0, else it's a combination of dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1].
Use memoization to store the intermediate results in a dictionary where the keys are the indices and the values are the corresponding computed results.
