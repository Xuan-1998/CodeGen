The problem can be solved by solving smaller instances of the same problem and combining their solutions to solve the original problem, so use bottom-up approach with tabulation.
Define dp[i][0] as ... for all 0 <= i <= n.
dp[i][j] = 1 if i == 0 and j in [0, 31] else (a^i & (1 << j)) ^ (b >> j)
Use a dictionary memo to store the intermediate results, where memo[(i, j)] = ...
