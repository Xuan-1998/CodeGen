Decide if the optimal substructure is a monotonic function of some subproblem solution, then use top-down approach with memoization.
Let the state be (a & b, i) where a & b is the bitwise AND operation on a and b, and i is the iteration index. The base case can be when any bit in a or b becomes zero.
The state can be (a, i) where a is the bitwise AND operation on a and b, and the transition relationship is determined by the parity of bits in both numbers.
Use top-down dynamic programming with a recursive function and a dictionary to store previously computed values.
