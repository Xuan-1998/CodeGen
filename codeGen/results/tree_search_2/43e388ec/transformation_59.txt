Identify the base case and recursive relation for the dynamic programming problem. Determine if a table or dictionary is needed to store previously computed values.
The state could be defined as (a, b, i) representing the sum of XOR(a, left_shift(b, i)) for all values of i from 0 to 314159.
state: (b, i), transition: dp[b][i] = dp[b-1][i] + XOR(a, left_shift(b, i)), table: 2D list
Creating a function that recursively calculates the dynamic programming problem using a loop from 0 to 314159 for each binary number b.
