The problem can be solved by solving smaller instances of the same problem and combining their solutions to solve the original problem, so use bottom-up approach with tabulation.
The state transition relation is dp[i][j+1] = ..., given dp[i][j].
dp[i][j] represents the sum of OR(a, b<<i) for all a from 0 to 2^k-1 and all b up to j.
You can use a 2D array to store the intermediate results of dp[i][j], and then calculate the final result by summing up all values in the array modulo 10^9+7.
