Decide if the optimal substructure is a monotonic function of some subproblem solution, then use top-down approach with memoization.
Let the state be (i, a) where i is the iteration index and a is the current value of a. The base case can be when i > 314159.
Transition relationship: dp[i][b] = (a ^ b) + dp[i-1][b>>1], considering modulo 10^9+7.
Utilize a 2D array dp[i][b] to store the results of subproblems for each iteration i and value b
