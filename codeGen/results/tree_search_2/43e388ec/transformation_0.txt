Decide if the optimal substructure is a monotonic function of some subproblem solution, then use top-down approach with memoization.
Let the state be (i, a) where i is the iteration index and a is the current value of a. The base case can be when i > 314159.
State: (i, b), where i is the iteration index and b is the current value of b.
Create a 2D table dp[i][a] to store the result for each subproblem. Initialize all values in the table as -1, then fill it up from top-down approach using memoization.
