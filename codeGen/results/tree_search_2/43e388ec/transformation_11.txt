Decide if the optimal substructure is a monotonic function of some subproblem solution, then use top-down approach with memoization.
Let the state be (i, a) where i is the iteration index and a is the current value of a. The base case can be when i > 314159.
State: (i, a), where i is the iteration index and a is the current value of a. The transition relationship can be based on the exclusive OR operation and binary shift to the left operation on b for each possible value of i from 0 to 314159.
You can also create a dictionary memo where the key is the current state and the value is the result of that state, then update the memo as you recursively solve each subproblem.
