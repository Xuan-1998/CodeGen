The problem can be solved by solving smaller instances of the same problem and combining their solutions to solve the original problem, so use bottom-up approach with tabulation.
The state expression is dp[i][j] = ..., where i is the number of bits in a, j is the bit position.
dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j % (i+1)] if j > i else 0) + ((a >> i) ^ b) * pow(2, i)
Apply bottom-up approach by filling up the table in a loop from left to right, updating each cell as you go.
