Decide if the optimal substructure is a monotonic function of some subproblem solution, then use top-down approach with memoization.
Let the state be (i, a) where i is the iteration index and a is the current value of a. The base case can be when i > 314159.
State: (i, a, b), where i is the iteration index, a is the current value of a, and b is the current value of b. Transition relationship: dp[i][a][b] = (a ^ b) + dp[i-1][a>>1][b>>1], considering modulo 10^9+7.
Use a dictionary as memoization to store intermediate results based on the current state (i, a, b)
