Decide if the optimal substructure is a monotonic function of some subproblem solution, then use top-down approach with memoization.
The state is (b, i) where b is the current value of b and i is the iteration index. The base case can be when b becomes zero.
The state is (i, b) where i is the current value of i and b is the left shifted value of b. The base case can be when i becomes 314159.
Use a 2D array to store the state and fill it in a bottom-up manner. The base case can be when b becomes zero.
