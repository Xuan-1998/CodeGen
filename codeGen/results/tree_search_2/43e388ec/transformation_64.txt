Identify the base case and recursive relation for the dynamic programming problem. Determine if a table or dictionary is needed to store previously computed values.
The state could be defined as (i) and the base case is when i = 0, with a recursive relation that calculates the sum for each subsequent value of i.
State: (i, a, b), Transition: update_state(i-1, a<<1, b), Base Case: when i == 0
Use a dictionary to store previously computed values and fill it in an iterative manner, using the state as the key.
