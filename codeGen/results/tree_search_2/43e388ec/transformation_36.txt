The problem can be solved by solving smaller instances of the same problem and combining their solutions to solve the original problem, so use bottom-up approach with tabulation.
The state expression is dp[i][j] = ..., where i is the number of bits in a, j is the bit position.
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + (a & 1) * (b >> i)
Create a dictionary where the key is the tuple (i, j) and the value is the calculated dp[i][j].
