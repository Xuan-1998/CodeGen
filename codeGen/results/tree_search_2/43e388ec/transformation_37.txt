The problem can be solved by solving smaller instances of the same problem and combining their solutions to solve the original problem, so use bottom-up approach with tabulation.
Define dp[i][0] as ... for all 0 <= i <= n.
dp[i][j] = (a^i & (1 << j)) ^ (b >> j) + dp[i-1][0]
Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming state, where dp[i][j] represents the sum of OR operation and binary shift for all values of i up to i = j.
