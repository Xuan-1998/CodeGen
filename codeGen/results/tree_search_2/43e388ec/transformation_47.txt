The problem can be solved by solving smaller instances of the same problem and combining their solutions to solve the original problem, so use bottom-up approach with tabulation.
The state transition relation is dp[i][j+1] = ..., given dp[i][j].
dp[i][j] is the sum of dp[i-1][j-1] for all i from 1 to k and all j from 1 to n, plus some constant term.
Use a dictionary where dp[(a, b)] stores the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing XOR operation on a and binary shift to the left operation on b for all values of a and b.
