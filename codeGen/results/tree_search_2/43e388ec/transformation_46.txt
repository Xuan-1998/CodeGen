The problem can be solved by solving smaller instances of the same problem and combining their solutions to solve the original problem, so use bottom-up approach with tabulation.
The state transition relation is dp[i][j+1] = ..., given dp[i][j].
dp[i][j] is the sum of dp[i-1][j-1] for all i from 1 to k and all j from 1 to n, plus some constant term.
Use a 2D array where dp[i][j] stores the result of performing XOR operation on a and binary shift to the left operation on b for all values of i from 0 to k and j from 0 to n.
