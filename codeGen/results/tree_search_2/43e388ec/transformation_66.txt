Identify the base case and recursive relation for the dynamic programming problem. Determine if a table or dictionary is needed to store previously computed values.
The state could be defined as (i) and the base case is when i = 0, with a recursive relation that calculates the sum for each subsequent value of i.
State: (i, a, b), Transition: update_state(i-1, xor(a, b>>i), and(b, 1)), Base Case: when i >= len(bin(a))+len(bin(b))
Consider using a table to store previously computed values for each state (i, a, b).
