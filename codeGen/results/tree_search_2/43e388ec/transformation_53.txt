Identify the base case and recursive relation for the dynamic programming problem. Determine if a table or dictionary is needed to store previously computed values.
The state could be defined as (a, b, i) representing the sum of XOR(a, left_shift(b, i)) for all values of i from 0 to 314159.
state: (i, b), transition: dp[i] = dp[i-1] + XOR(a, left_shift(b, i)), table: dictionary
Tabulation-based DP implementation using a list of lists to store the state values and compute the next state values.
