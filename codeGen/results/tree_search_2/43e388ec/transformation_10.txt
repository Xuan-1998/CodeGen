Decide if the optimal substructure is a monotonic function of some subproblem solution, then use top-down approach with memoization.
Let the state be (i, a) where i is the iteration index and a is the current value of a. The base case can be when i > 314159.
State: (i, a), where i is the iteration index and a is the current value of a. The transition relationship can be based on the exclusive OR operation and binary shift to the left operation on b for each possible value of i from 0 to 314159.
Another approach would be to use a 2D array tab to store the results of subproblems, with dimensions (314159 + 1) * (2^10^5 + 1).
