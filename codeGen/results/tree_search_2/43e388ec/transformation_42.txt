The problem can be solved by solving smaller instances of the same problem and combining their solutions to solve the original problem, so use bottom-up approach with tabulation.
Define dp[i][0] as ... for all 0 <= i <= n.
dp[i][j] = 1 if i == 0 and j in [0, 31] else (a^i & (1 << j)) ^ (b >> j)
Create an array dp of size n+1 where each cell dp[i] stores the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on i and the binary shift to the left operation on 0 for all values of i from 0 to n.
