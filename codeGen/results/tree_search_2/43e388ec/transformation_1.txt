Decide if the optimal substructure is a monotonic function of some subproblem solution, then use top-down approach with memoization.
Let the state be (i, a) where i is the iteration index and a is the current value of a. The base case can be when i > 314159.
State: (i, b), where i is the iteration index and b is the current value of b.
Use a dictionary memo to store the results of subproblems. The state can be represented by a tuple (i, a), and the function returns dp[i][a] = b when the result for state (i, a) is calculated.
