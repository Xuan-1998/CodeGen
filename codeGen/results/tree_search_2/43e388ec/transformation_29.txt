The problem can be solved by solving smaller instances of the same problem and combining their solutions to solve the original problem, so use bottom-up approach with tabulation.
The state expression is dp[i][j] = ..., where i is the number of bits in a, j is the bit position.
dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][0] if j == 0 else dp[i-1][j]) + (a & 1) * (b >> (i - 1))
Implement a bottom-up approach by initializing the dp table and filling it in a single pass.
