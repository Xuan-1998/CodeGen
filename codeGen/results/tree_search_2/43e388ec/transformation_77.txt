Identify the base case and recursive relation for the dynamic programming problem. Determine if a table or dictionary is needed to store previously computed values.
A dictionary d could be used to store previously computed values of XOR(a, left_shift(b, i)) for all values of i from 0 to 314159.
Define an array dp where dp[i] represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing XOR operation on a and the binary shift to the left operation on b for all values of i from 0 to k, then update each dp[i] by adding the value at dp[i-1] if i > 0.
Create a table t where t[(a << i) ^ b] stores previously computed values of XOR(a, left_shift(b, i)) for all values of i from 0 to 314159.
