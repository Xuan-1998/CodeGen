Decide if the optimal substructure is a monotonic function of some subproblem solution, then use top-down approach with memoization.
Let the state be (a & b, i) where a & b is the bitwise AND operation on a and b, and i is the iteration index. The base case can be when any bit in a or b becomes zero.
The state can be ((a & b) | (a & (~b))) with no transition relationship as the solution does not depend on previous iterations.
Implement dynamic programming using tabulation by initializing a 2D table with zeros and filling it up iteratively.
