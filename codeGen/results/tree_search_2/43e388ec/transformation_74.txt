Identify the base case and recursive relation for the dynamic programming problem. Determine if a table or dictionary is needed to store previously computed values.
A dictionary d could be used to store previously computed values of XOR(a, left_shift(b, i)) for all values of i from 0 to 314159.
The state is a tuple containing the current values of a and b, and the transition relationship is to update the state by performing XOR operation on the previous result with the next binary shift of b.
Use a one-dimensional table to store the dynamic programming values, where each cell represents the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the XOR operation on 'a' and the left shift of 'b' for a specific value of 'i', taking into account the periodicity of the binary operations.
