Identify the base case and recursive relation for the dynamic programming problem. Determine if a table or dictionary is needed to store previously computed values.
A dictionary d could be used to store previously computed values of XOR(a, left_shift(b, i)) for all values of i from 0 to 314159.
The state is the current value of b, and the transition relationship is to update the state by shifting it one bit to the left.
Use memoization by passing the current value of b as an argument to a function that calculates the result for each i
