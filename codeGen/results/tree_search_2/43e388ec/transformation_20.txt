Decide if the optimal substructure is a monotonic function of some subproblem solution, then use top-down approach with memoization.
Let the state be (a & b, i) where a & b is the bitwise AND operation on a and b, and i is the iteration index. The base case can be when any bit in a or b becomes zero.
The state can be (a ^ (b << i), i) where a ^ (b << i) is the XOR operation between a and the left shift of b by i bits.
Use dictionary to store intermediate results and look up previous solutions
