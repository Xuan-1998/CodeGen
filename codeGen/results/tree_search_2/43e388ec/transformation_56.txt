Identify the base case and recursive relation for the dynamic programming problem. Determine if a table or dictionary is needed to store previously computed values.
The state could be defined as (a, b, i) representing the sum of XOR(a, left_shift(b, i)) for all values of i from 0 to 314159.
state: (a, i), transition: dp[a][i] = dp[a-1][i] + XOR(a, left_shift(b, i)), table: 2D list
Implement memoization using a dictionary with the key being (a, i) and the value being the sum of XOR(a, left_shift(b, i)) for all values of i from 0 to 314159.
