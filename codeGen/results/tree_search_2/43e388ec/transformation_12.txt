Decide if the optimal substructure is a monotonic function of some subproblem solution, then use top-down approach with memoization.
The state is (b, i) where b is the current value of b and i is the iteration index. The base case can be when b becomes zero.
State: (a, i), (b, i) where a is the current value of a, i is the iteration index, and we need to compute the result of XOR operation between a and left shifted b for each i.
Create a 2D array dp[b][i] where dp[b][i] stores the sum modulo 10^9+7 of the result of performing the exclusive OR operation on a and the binary shift to the left operation on b for all values of i from 0 to k, where k is the maximum iteration index. Then, fill up this table based on the recurrence relation.
