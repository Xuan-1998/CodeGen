The problem can be solved by solving smaller instances of the same problem and combining their solutions to solve the original problem, so use bottom-up approach with tabulation.
Define dp[i][0] as ... for all 0 <= i <= n.
dp[i][j] = (a^i & (1 << j)) ^ (b >> j) + dp[i-1][0]
Implement tabulation using a 2D array where each cell dp[i][j] is computed based on the previous cells and then summed up.
