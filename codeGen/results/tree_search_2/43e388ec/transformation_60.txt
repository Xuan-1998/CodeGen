Identify the base case and recursive relation for the dynamic programming problem. Determine if a table or dictionary is needed to store previously computed values.
The state could be defined as (i) and the base case is when i = 0, with a recursive relation that calculates the sum for each subsequent value of i.
State: (a, b, i), Transition: update_state(a, b, i-1), Base Case: when i == 0
Create a table to store the sum of XOR and shift operations for each state (i), with dimensions (10^5 + 7) x 2, initialized with zeros.
