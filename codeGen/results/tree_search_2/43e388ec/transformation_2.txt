Decide if the optimal substructure is a monotonic function of some subproblem solution, then use top-down approach with memoization.
Let the state be (i, a) where i is the iteration index and a is the current value of a. The base case can be when i > 314159.
State: (i, b), where i is the iteration index and b is the current value of b.
Maintain two lists, one for 'a' values and one for 'b' values. For each pair of values, calculate the result using the given operations and store it in another list. Then use this list to find the required sum modulo 10^9+7.
