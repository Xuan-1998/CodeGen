Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The state would be updated by considering the maximum possible speed for the remaining distance
: The maximum distance that can be traveled at this speed before it needs to be updated.
You could use dynamic programming by initializing a table with zeros, where each cell represents the maximum possible length of the path segment up to a certain time with an initial speed, then update the cells based on the rules of constant speed and the allowed change in speed between adjacent seconds.
