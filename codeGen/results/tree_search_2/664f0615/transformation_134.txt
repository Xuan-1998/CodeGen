Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The final speed would be reached when the given time is exceeded
The transition relationship could be that the next state is determined by whether the maximum possible length of the path segment would increase if the current speed was maintained for another second.
Apply memoization by storing the intermediate results in a dictionary and avoiding redundant calculations for similar states.
