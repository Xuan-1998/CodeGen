The time it takes to travel the distance could be broken down into smaller segments, with each segment having its own initial and final speed constraints.
The state could be defined as a tuple (speed, time) where speed is the current speed and time is the current second.
The state could be defined as a tuple (speed, time), where speed is the current speed and time is the current second. The transition relationship would depend on whether the current speed is within the allowed range or not.
Use dynamic programming with 2D table to store maximum distance for each possible combination of speed and time.
