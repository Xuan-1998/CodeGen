Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The state would be updated by considering the maximum possible speed for the remaining distance
The state could be a tuple of (remaining time, remaining distance) and the transition would update these values based on the allowed change in speed.\
Implement tabulation using a 2D array to store intermediate results where rows represent the remaining time and columns represent the remaining distance, and update the state by considering the allowed change in speed.
