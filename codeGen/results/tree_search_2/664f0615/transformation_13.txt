The maximum allowed change in speed could be used to identify overlapping subproblems, such as considering only the differences in speed between adjacent seconds rather than the absolute speeds themselves.
State: let dp[i][diff] represent the maximum possible length of path segment up to i-th second with a difference in speed diff from the previous second.
state dp[i][speed] as the maximum possible length of path segment up to i-th second when the current speed is speed, with transitions defined by whether the current speed differs from the previous one by at most the allowed change
Using dynamic programming to build up the maximum possible length of path segment, with dp[i][speed] representing the maximum possible length at the i-th second when the current speed is speed
