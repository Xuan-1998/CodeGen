Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The state would be updated when the next second's speed is calculated
State: (speed, time) -> maximum distance traveled so far; Transition: update speed for next second based on current speed and max change, and increment time.
Store the maximum distance traveled for each possible speed in a list and use that as a base for memoization
