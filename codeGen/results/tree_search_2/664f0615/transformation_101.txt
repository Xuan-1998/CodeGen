Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (time, max_change) - The time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed
The state could be defined as the current time elapsed since the initial speed was recorded.
Create a memoization function that takes in the current time elapsed, maximum allowed change in speed, and initial/final speeds as arguments, and returns the maximum possible length of the path segment.
