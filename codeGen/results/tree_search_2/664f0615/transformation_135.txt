Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (current_speed, remaining_time) - The current speed of the car and the remaining distance to cover
Define state as (time, speed) and formulate a relationship between states based on the maximum allowed change in speed.
Use dynamic programming with 2D array to store intermediate results where each cell [t, s] represents the maximum possible length of path segment at time t and speed s.
