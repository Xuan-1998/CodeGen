Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The maximum allowed change in speed is not considered in this base case
The length of the segment where the speed is constant for every second, considering the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds should not exceed the maximum allowed change in speed.
To apply dynamic programming with memoization, where you solve smaller instances of the problem first and store their solutions, then use those solutions to solve larger instances.
