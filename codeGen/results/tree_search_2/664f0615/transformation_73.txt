Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (initial_speed, time) - The current speed of the car at the given time
Instead of considering the whole time, consider breaking it down into smaller segments of constant speed. State can be represented as (time_segment, segment_speed), where time_segment is the duration of the current segment and segment_speed is the constant speed for that segment. The next state would be determined by either increasing or decreasing the segment speed within the allowed change, considering the remaining distance to cover in each segment.
Use memoization to optimize the recursive function by storing intermediate results in a dictionary. This allows for efficient computation of the maximum length of the path segment without recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.
