Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The state would be updated when the next second's speed is calculated
State: (speed, time, distance) -> maximum allowed distance to travel at this speed; Transition: check if new distance can be added within the allowed range.
Implement a recursive function that calculates the maximum distance based on the current speed, time, and the allowed change in speed between adjacent seconds, with memoization used to avoid redundant calculations.
