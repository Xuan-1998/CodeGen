Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (time, max_change) - The time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed
Memoize the results of these updates for each second.
You can use a dictionary to store the intermediate results, using tuples of (time, max_change) as keys and distances as values.
