The time it takes to travel the distance could be broken down into smaller segments, with each segment having its own initial and final speed constraints.
The state could be defined as a tuple (speed, time) where speed is the current speed and time is the current second.
The state could be defined as a tuple (time, max_speed), where time is the current second and max_speed is the maximum speed for this segment.
Use a 2D array to store the maximum length of path segment at each state (speed, time) as dynamic programming progresses.
