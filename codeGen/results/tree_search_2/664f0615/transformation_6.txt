The maximum allowed change in speed could be used to identify overlapping subproblems, such as considering only the differences in speed between adjacent seconds rather than the absolute speeds themselves.
State: let dp[i][diff] represent the maximum possible length of path segment up to i-th second with a difference in speed diff from the previous second.
let dp[i][speed] be the maximum possible length of path segment up to i-th second when the current speed is speed, with the initial speed being the given initial_speed.
Use dynamic programming by iterating over all possible differences in speed and building a table of maximum lengths for each difference.
