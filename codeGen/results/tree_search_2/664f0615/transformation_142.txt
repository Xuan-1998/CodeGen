Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (current_speed, remaining_time) - The current speed of the car and the remaining distance to cover
Consider a state (time, initial_speed, final_speed) that captures the remaining time, initial speed, and final speed. The transition relation would be based on updating the initial and final speeds by the maximum allowed change in each step.
Apply dynamic programming by creating a 2D array where the rows represent the remaining time and the columns represent the possible initial speeds, then fill in the array using the transition relation.
