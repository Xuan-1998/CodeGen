Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (time, max_change) - The time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed
For each second, check if the current speed is within the allowed range and update the maximum possible length accordingly.
Dynamically build a 2D table where each cell represents the maximum possible length for a given time and maximum allowed change in speed, using the previously calculated cells to avoid redundant calculations
