Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The state would be updated by considering the maximum possible speed for the remaining distance
\
Using bottom-up dynamic programming with a 2D table, where each cell (i, j) represents the maximum possible length of the path segment at the ith second and the jth maximum allowed change in speed.
