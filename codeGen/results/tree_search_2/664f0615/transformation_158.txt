Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The state would be updated by considering the maximum possible speed for the remaining distance
: The maximum distance that can be traveled at this speed before it needs to be updated.
Consider storing the intermediate results as a dictionary where the keys are tuples of (initial_speed, current_time) and the values are the maximum possible distance that can be traveled at this speed up to the given time.
