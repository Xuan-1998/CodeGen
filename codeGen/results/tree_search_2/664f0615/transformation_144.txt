Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The base case would be when all the seconds are exhausted or the maximum allowed change in speed is reached
You can consider the current speed as a state and the next possible speeds given the previous speed and the maximum allowed change in speed as transitions.
Use dynamic programming to create a 2D table where each cell represents the maximum length that can be achieved with the given initial and final speed, time, and maximum allowed change in speed up to the current second.
