Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (time, max_change) - The time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed
The state could be defined as the current time elapsed since the initial speed was recorded.
You can use a dictionary to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations, for example: dp[(time, max_change)] = value.
