Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The state would be updated by considering the maximum possible speed for the remaining distance
The state would be the remaining time, and the transition would be the maximum possible distance that can be covered at the given speed.\
To implement memoization using a recursive function that keeps track of previously computed intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.
