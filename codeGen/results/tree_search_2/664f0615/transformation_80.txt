Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The maximum allowed change in speed is not considered in this base case
State: The current speed and time. Transition: Calculate the new state based on the current speed and the maximum allowed change in speed at each step, with the condition that the speed does not exceed the initial or final speed.
The dynamic programming solution could involve maintaining a dp array of size (final_speed - initial_speed + 1) * time, where each cell represents the maximum possible path length for a given speed at that second. The base case would be when the current speed is equal to the initial or final speed.
