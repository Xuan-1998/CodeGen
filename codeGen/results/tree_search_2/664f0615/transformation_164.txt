Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The state would be updated by considering the maximum possible speed for the remaining distance
The state could be a tuple of (remaining time, remaining distance) and the transition would update these values based on the allowed change in speed.\
To use dynamic programming with memoization by storing the maximum possible length of the path segment for each state as a dictionary where keys are tuples of (remaining time, remaining distance) and values are integers representing the maximum length.
