The maximum allowed change in speed could be used to identify overlapping subproblems, such as considering only the differences in speed between adjacent seconds rather than the absolute speeds themselves.
State: let dp[i][diff] represent the maximum possible length of path segment up to i-th second with a difference in speed diff from the previous second.
consider the maximum possible length of path segments in subproblems where the difference in speed between adjacent seconds is within the allowed_change_in_speed and use these subproblem solutions to construct the solution for the original problem
Use dynamic programming with bottom-up approach, where you start from the initial conditions and iteratively build up the solution for each second considering the maximum allowed change in speed.
