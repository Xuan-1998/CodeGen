Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The maximum allowed change in speed is not considered in this base case
State: The current speed and time. Transition: Calculate the new state based on the current speed and the maximum allowed change in speed at each step, with the condition that the speed does not exceed the initial or final speed.
The problem could also be approached by maintaining a memoization dictionary where the keys are tuples representing the current state (speed and time) and the values are the maximum possible path length for that state. This approach avoids redundant calculations by storing intermediate results in the memoization dictionary.
