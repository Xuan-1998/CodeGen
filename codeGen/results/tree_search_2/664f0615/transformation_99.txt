Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (time, max_change) - The time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed
Memoize the results of these calculations for each second.
To use dynamic programming with a 1D array to store intermediate results where indices represent seconds, and calculate the maximum possible length of the path segment by iterating through the array.
