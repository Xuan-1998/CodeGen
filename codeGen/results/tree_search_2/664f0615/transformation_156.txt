Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The state would be updated by considering the maximum possible speed for the remaining distance
: The current speed, and \
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by tabulating the maximum possible lengths for different segments, considering the constraints on the speed and the remaining distance.
