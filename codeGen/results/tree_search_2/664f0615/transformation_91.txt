Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The final speed is always reached after a certain amount of time
The state could be represented by the absolute difference between the current speed and the initial/final speeds, and the time, with transitions defined based on whether the difference is within the allowed change in speed.
