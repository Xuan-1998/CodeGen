Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The state would be updated by considering the maximum possible speed for the remaining distance
The state would be the remaining time, and the transition would be the maximum possible distance that can be covered at the given speed.\
To use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with a tabular representation where each cell represents the maximum possible length of the path segment up to the corresponding time, considering the constraints on the initial and final speeds and the allowed change in speed between any two adjacent seconds.
