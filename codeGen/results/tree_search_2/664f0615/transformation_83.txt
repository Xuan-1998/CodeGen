Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The final speed is always reached after a certain amount of time
Consider the maximum allowed change in speed as the key state variable, and the current speed and time as transition variables.
Consider using dynamic programming with tabulation to create a table where each cell represents the maximum possible length of the path segment for a given set of speed and time.
