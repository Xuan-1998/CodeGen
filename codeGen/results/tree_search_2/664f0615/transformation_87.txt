Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The final speed is always reached after a certain amount of time
The state could be represented by a tuple containing the current speed and time, with transitions defined based on whether the current speed is within the allowed range of the previous speed and time.
Store the dynamic programming table in a list where each row corresponds to a possible speed and each column corresponds to a possible time.
