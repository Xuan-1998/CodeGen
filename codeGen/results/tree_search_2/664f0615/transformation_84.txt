Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The final speed is always reached after a certain amount of time
Consider the maximum allowed change in speed as the key state variable, and the current speed and time as transition variables.
Use memoization to store the intermediate results in a dictionary, where the key is the current speed and the value is the maximum possible length of the path segment.
