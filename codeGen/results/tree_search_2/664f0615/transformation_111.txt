Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (time, max_change) - The time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed
The state could be defined as a combination of the current time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed.
Implement a recursive function that takes the current time elapsed, maximum allowed change in speed, initial and final speeds as inputs, and returns the maximum possible length of the path segment. Use memoization to store intermediate results.
