Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The state would be updated when the next second's speed is calculated
State: (speed, time, distance) -> maximum allowed distance to travel at this speed; Transition: check if new distance can be added within the allowed range.
Memoize the state space with a 2D array where each cell represents the maximum distance that can be traveled given the current speed and time, with the goal of avoiding redundant calculations when transitioning to the next second.
