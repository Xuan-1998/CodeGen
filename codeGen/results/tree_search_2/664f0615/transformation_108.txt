Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (time, max_change) - The time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed
Memoize the results of these updates for each second.
Create a function that recursively calculates the maximum distance for each possible combination of time and max_change, and uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
