The time it takes to travel the distance could be broken down into smaller segments, with each segment having its own initial and final speed constraints.
Another possibility is defining the state as a tuple (speed_diff, time) where speed_diff is the difference between the current speed and the initial speed, and time is the current second.
State: (time, initial_speed_to_current_speed), Transition: (current_speed_to_new_speed) if new_speed <= final_speed; else 0
The dynamic programming approach could be implemented by creating a table where each cell represents the maximum possible length of the path segment at that time and speed difference, with transitions being made to adjacent cells based on the constraints.
