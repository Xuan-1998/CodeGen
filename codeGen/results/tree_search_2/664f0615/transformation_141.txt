Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (current_speed, remaining_time) - The current speed of the car and the remaining distance to cover
Consider a state (time, initial_speed, final_speed) that captures the remaining time, initial speed, and final speed. The transition relation would be based on updating the initial and final speeds by the maximum allowed change in each step.
Use a dictionary to store intermediate results where keys are tuples of (time, initial_speed) and values are the maximum possible length of the path segment at that state.
