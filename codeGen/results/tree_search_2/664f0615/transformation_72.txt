Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (initial_speed, time) - The current speed of the car at the given time
Instead of considering the whole time, consider breaking it down into smaller segments of constant speed. State can be represented as (time_segment, segment_speed), where time_segment is the duration of the current segment and segment_speed is the constant speed for that segment. The next state would be determined by either increasing or decreasing the segment speed within the allowed change, considering the remaining distance to cover in each segment.
Dynamically build a 2D table to store the maximum length of the path segment that can be achieved with the given initial and final speed, time, and maximum allowed change in speed. The table rows represent the possible segment speeds, and columns represent the seconds.
