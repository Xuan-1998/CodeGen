Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The maximum allowed change in speed is not considered in this base case
State: The current speed and time. Transition: Calculate the new state based on the current speed and the maximum allowed change in speed at each step, with the condition that the speed does not exceed the initial or final speed.
Another option would be to use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you start from the final speed and iterate backwards towards the initial speed, maintaining an array of dp values representing the maximum possible path lengths for each speed at each second.
