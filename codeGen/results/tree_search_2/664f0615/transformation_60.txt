The time it takes to travel the distance could be broken down into smaller segments, with each segment having its own initial and final speed constraints.
Another possibility is defining the state as a tuple (speed_diff, time) where speed_diff is the difference between the current speed and the initial speed, and time is the current second.
State: (time, current_speed), Transition: (new_speed) if abs(new_speed - current_speed) <= max_allowed_change; else 0
Implement memoization using a dictionary where the keys are tuples representing the state (speed_diff, time) and the values are the corresponding maximum lengths
