Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The state would be updated when the next second's speed is calculated
State: (speed, time, distance) -> maximum allowed distance to travel at this speed; Transition: check if new distance can be added within the allowed range.
Use memoization to store the intermediate results during the dynamic programming process, specifically storing the maximum distance that can be traveled at each possible speed and time combination.
