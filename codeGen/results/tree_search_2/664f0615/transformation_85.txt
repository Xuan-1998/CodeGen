Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The final speed is always reached after a certain amount of time
Consider the maximum allowed change in speed as the key state variable, and the current speed and time as transition variables.
Implement memoization by creating a function that takes the current speed as input, calculates the maximum allowed change in speed, and then recursively calls itself until the final speed is reached.
