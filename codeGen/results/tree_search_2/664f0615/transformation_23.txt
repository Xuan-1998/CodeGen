The maximum allowed change in speed could be used to identify overlapping subproblems, such as considering only the differences in speed between adjacent seconds rather than the absolute speeds themselves.
State: let dp[i][speed] represent the maximum possible length of path segment up to i-th second with speed, considering only the previous second.
Let state be (i, speed), where dp[i][speed] represents the maximum possible length of path segment up to i-th second with a constant speed of speed.
Explore the possibility of tabulation by initializing a 2D array dp with dimensions (time, max_speed) and filling it recursively.
