The time it takes to travel the distance could be broken down into smaller segments, with each segment having its own initial and final speed constraints.
The base case could be when the time becomes equal to the maximum allowed time, in which case the maximum possible length of the path segment would be calculated based on the initial and final speed.
state: (speed, length), where speed is within [initial, final] and length is a cumulative sum of lengths up to the current state. Transition: if the current speed is within [initial, final], then the new state is (new_speed, new_length) where new_speed = old_speed +/- max_change and new_length = old_length + 1.
Create a bottom-up dynamic programming table using a nested loop to iterate over all possible speeds and lengths.
