The time it takes to travel the distance could be broken down into smaller segments, with each segment having its own initial and final speed constraints.
The state could be defined as a tuple (speed, time) where speed is the current speed and time is the current second.
The state could be defined as a tuple (time, allowed_speed_change), where time is the current second and allowed_speed_change is the maximum speed change for this segment.
Implement memoization using a dictionary to store the computed values for each state (time, allowed_speed_change), and use this dictionary to look up previously computed values.
