The maximum allowed change in speed could be used to identify overlapping subproblems, such as considering only the differences in speed between adjacent seconds rather than the absolute speeds themselves.
State: let dp[i][speed] represent the maximum possible length of path segment up to i-th second with speed, considering only the previous second.
Let state be (i, prev_speed), where dp[i][prev_speed] represents the maximum possible length of path segment up to i-th second considering only the last second's speed and maximum allowed change.
Using a 2D array with tabulation: for each subproblem, calculate the maximum possible length based on the previous speeds and update the current state accordingly.
