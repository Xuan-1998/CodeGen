Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (time, max_change) - The time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed
The state could be defined as the current time elapsed since the initial speed was recorded.
You can use a 2D array to store intermediate results where dp[time][max_change] stores the maximum possible length of the path segment at each second.
