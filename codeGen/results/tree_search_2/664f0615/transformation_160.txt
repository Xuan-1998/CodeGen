Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The state would be updated by considering the maximum possible speed for the remaining distance
: The maximum distance that can be traveled at this speed before it needs to be updated.
Another approach would be to use memoization within a recursive function that calculates the maximum distance for a given time and initial speed, by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.
