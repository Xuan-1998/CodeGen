Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (time, max_change) - The time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed
For each second, check if the current speed is within the allowed range and update the maximum possible length accordingly.
Use memoization within a recursive function that calculates the maximum possible length by recursively updating the maximum allowed change in speed
