The maximum allowed change in speed could be used to identify overlapping subproblems, such as considering only the differences in speed between adjacent seconds rather than the absolute speeds themselves.
The base case is dp[0][speed] = 0 for all speeds.
The state could be the current time, and the transition relationship could consider the maximum allowed change in speed between adjacent seconds; A base case would be the initial or final speed.
You can implement dynamic programming using a 2D array with dimensions (time+1) x (speed+1), where dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible length of the path segment at time i and speed j.
