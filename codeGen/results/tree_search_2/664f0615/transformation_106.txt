Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (time, max_change) - The time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed
Memoize the results of these updates for each second.
You can create a 2D table where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum distance that can be traveled with initial speed i and maximum allowed change j.
