The maximum allowed change in speed could be used to identify overlapping subproblems, such as considering only the differences in speed between adjacent seconds rather than the absolute speeds themselves.
The base case is dp[0][speed] = 0 for all speeds.
The state could be a combination of the current speed, previous speed, and time elapsed; The dynamic programming table dp[i][speed] could represent the maximum possible length at the ith second with the given speed.
Implement a 3D DP table where each cell represents the maximum possible length for a given current speed, previous speed, and time elapsed.
