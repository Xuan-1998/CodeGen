Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (time, max_change) - The time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed
For each second, update the maximum possible length of the path segment based on the current speed and the remaining distance to travel.
Memoize the function that calculates the maximum possible length of the path segment based on the time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed, and use this memoized function to avoid redundant calculations.
