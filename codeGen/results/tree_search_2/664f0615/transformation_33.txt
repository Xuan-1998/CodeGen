The maximum allowed change in speed could be used to identify overlapping subproblems, such as considering only the differences in speed between adjacent seconds rather than the absolute speeds themselves.
The base case is dp[0][speed] = 0 for all speeds.
The state could be the current time, and the transition relationship could consider the maximum allowed change in speed between adjacent seconds; A base case would be the initial or final speed.
Another option is to use memoization by defining a function that takes current time and speed as arguments, and returns the maximum possible length of the path segment for those parameters. This way, you can avoid redundant calculations by storing the results in a dictionary or cache.
