Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (time, max_change) - The time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed
The state could be defined as a combination of the current time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed.
Use a dictionary to store memoized values, with keys as tuples representing the state (time, max_change) and values as the corresponding maximum length of path segment.
