Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (time, max_change) - The time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed
Memoize the results of these checks for each second.
Use dynamic programming to build up a table of maximum possible lengths for each state, starting from an empty string.
