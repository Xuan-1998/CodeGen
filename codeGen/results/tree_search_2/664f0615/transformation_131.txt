Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The final speed would be reached when the given time is exceeded
The transition relationship could be that the next state is determined by whether the current speed is increased or decreased within the allowed change in speed.
Use a dictionary-based memoization to store and retrieve previously computed values.
