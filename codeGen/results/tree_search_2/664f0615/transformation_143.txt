Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (current_speed, remaining_time) - The current speed of the car and the remaining distance to cover
Consider a state (time, initial_speed, final_speed) that captures the remaining time, initial speed, and final speed. The transition relation would be based on updating the initial and final speeds by the maximum allowed change in each step.
Use memoization with a recursive function to store results for subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.
