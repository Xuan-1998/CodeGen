Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The state would be updated when the next second's speed is calculated
State: (time) -> maximum distance traveled so far at constant speed; Transition: update speed for next second based on current speed and max change.
Implement memoization for the recursive function that calculates the maximum distance traveled at each second
