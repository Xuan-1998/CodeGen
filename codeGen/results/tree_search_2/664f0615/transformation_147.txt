Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The base case would be when all the seconds are exhausted or the maximum allowed change in speed is reached
You could represent the state as the difference between the current and initial speed, and the transition as adding or subtracting the maximum allowed change in speed from this difference.
The dynamic programming approach uses a 2D table where each cell (i, j) represents the maximum length of the path segment that can be achieved with an initial speed of i and the maximum allowed change in speed being j.
