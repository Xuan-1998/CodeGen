Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (current_speed, remaining_time) - The current speed of the car and the remaining distance to cover
A possible state could be (remaining_distance, current_speed, time_elapsed), where remaining_distance is the distance left to cover at each step, and time_elapsed keeps track of the seconds elapsed. The transition relation would update these values based on the constant speed and the maximum allowed change.
Memoize function calls with a dictionary where the key is the state (remaining_distance, current_speed, time_elapsed) and the value is the maximum possible length of the path segment.
