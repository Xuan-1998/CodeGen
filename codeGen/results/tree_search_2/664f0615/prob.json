"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given the initial and final speed of a car, along with the time it takes to travel a certain distance and the maximum allowed change in speed between any two adjacent seconds, find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters, assuming that the speed is constant at each second.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of two lines containing four integers in total, where the first line contains the initial and final speed of the car, and the second line contains the time it takes to travel the distance and the maximum allowed change in speed between any two adjacent seconds. The input is provided through standard input.\\n\\nOutput: The output should be a single integer representing the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters.\\n\\nConstraints: The initial and final speed are integers between 1 and 100 meters per second, the time is an integer between 2 and 100 seconds, and the maximum allowed change in speed is an integer between 0 and 10 meters per second. It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that the speed in the first second equals the initial speed, the speed in the last second equals the final speed, and the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed the maximum allowed change in speed.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Dynamic programming', 'Mathematics', 'Greedy algorithms']\", \"difficulties\": \"MEDIUM\", \"source\": \"codeforces\", \"url\": \"https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/534/B\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"5 6\\n4 2\\n\", \"output\": \"26\"}, {\"input\": \"10 10\\n10 0\\n\", \"output\": \"100\"}, {\"input\": \"87 87\\n2 10\\n\", \"output\": \"174\"}, {\"input\": \"1 11\\n6 2\\n\", \"output\": \"36\"}, {\"input\": \"100 10\\n10 10\\n\", \"output\": \"550\"}, {\"input\": \"1 1\\n100 10\\n\", \"output\": \"24600\"}, {\"input\": \"1 1\\n5 1\\n\", \"output\": \"9\"}, {\"input\": \"1 1\\n5 2\\n\", \"output\": \"13\"}, {\"input\": \"100 100\\n100 0\\n\", \"output\": \"10000\"}, {\"input\": \"100 100\\n100 10\\n\", \"output\": \"34500\"}, {\"input\": \"1 100\\n100 1\\n\", \"output\": \"5050\"}, {\"input\": \"1 100\\n100 10\\n\", \"output\": \"29305\"}, {\"input\": \"100 1\\n100 1\\n\", \"output\": \"5050\"}, {\"input\": \"100 1\\n100 10\\n\", \"output\": \"29305\"}, {\"input\": \"1 10\\n2 10\\n\", \"output\": \"11\"}]}"
