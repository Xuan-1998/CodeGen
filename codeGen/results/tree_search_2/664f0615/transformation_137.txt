Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (current_speed, remaining_time) - The current speed of the car and the remaining distance to cover
Define state as (time, speed) and formulate a relationship between states based on the maximum allowed change in speed.
Employ bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D array with zeros and filling it up according to the relationship between states.
