Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (time, max_change) - The time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed
The state could be defined as a combination of the current time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed.
Consider using a 2D array to store intermediate results, with dimensions (time+1) by (max_change+1), where dp[i][j] represents the maximum length of path segment that can be completed within i seconds and with a maximum allowed change in speed of j.
