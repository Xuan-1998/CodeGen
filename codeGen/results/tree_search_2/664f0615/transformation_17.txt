The maximum allowed change in speed could be used to identify overlapping subproblems, such as considering only the differences in speed between adjacent seconds rather than the absolute speeds themselves.
The base case is dp[1][diff] = 1 if the initial speed minus diff is within the range and 0 otherwise, since there's only one second before the first second.
Think about a state where only the current time elapsed (t) is used, with transition being made based on whether the absolute value of the difference between current and next speeds does not exceed the maximum allowed change in speed.
tabulation_result = [[0] * (t + 1) for _ in range(max_diff + 1)]
