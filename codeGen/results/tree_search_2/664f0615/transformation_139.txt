Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (current_speed, remaining_time) - The current speed of the car and the remaining distance to cover
A possible state could be (remaining_distance, current_speed, time_elapsed), where remaining_distance is the distance left to cover at each step, and time_elapsed keeps track of the seconds elapsed. The transition relation would update these values based on the constant speed and the maximum allowed change.
Use dynamic programming to store intermediate results in a 2D table where each cell represents the maximum possible length for a given state (remaining_distance, current_speed, time_elapsed).
