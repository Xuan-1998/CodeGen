The time it takes to travel the distance could be broken down into smaller segments, with each segment having its own initial and final speed constraints.
The base case could be when the time becomes equal to the maximum allowed time, in which case the maximum possible length of the path segment would be calculated based on the initial and final speed.
state: (speed, time), where speed is within [initial, final] and time is within [1, max_time]. Transition: if the current speed is equal to initial or final, then the new state is (new_speed, new_time) where new_speed = old_speed and new_time = old_time + 1. If the time increment is greater than 1, then skip this transition.
