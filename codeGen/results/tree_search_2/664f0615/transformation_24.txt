The maximum allowed change in speed could be used to identify overlapping subproblems, such as considering only the differences in speed between adjacent seconds rather than the absolute speeds themselves.
State: let dp[i][speed] represent the maximum possible length of path segment up to i-th second with speed, considering only the previous second.
State: let dp[i][diff] represent the maximum possible length of path segment up to i-th second with a difference in speed from previous second being diff.
Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming state for both speed and difference cases separately.
