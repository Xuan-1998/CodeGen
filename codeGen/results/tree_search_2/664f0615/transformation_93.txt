Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (time, max_change) - The time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed
The state could be defined as a tuple containing the current speed and the remaining distance to travel.
Define the state as a tuple containing the current speed, remaining distance, and maximum allowed change in speed, and use memoization to store intermediate results.
