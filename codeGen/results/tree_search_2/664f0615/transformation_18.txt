The maximum allowed change in speed could be used to identify overlapping subproblems, such as considering only the differences in speed between adjacent seconds rather than the absolute speeds themselves.
The base case is dp[1][diff] = 1 if the initial speed minus diff is within the range and 0 otherwise, since there's only one second before the first second.
Formulate a state where both initial and final speed are considered, along with the current time elapsed, with transition being made by updating the current speed according to the rules of constant speed within each second.
Consider using dynamic programming with a 2D table where rows represent the seconds and columns represent the maximum allowed difference in speed between adjacent seconds.
