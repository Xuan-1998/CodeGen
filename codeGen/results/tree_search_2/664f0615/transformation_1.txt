The maximum allowed change in speed could be used to identify overlapping subproblems, such as considering only the differences in speed between adjacent seconds rather than the absolute speeds themselves.
State: let dp[i][j] represent the maximum possible length of path segment up to i-th second with speed j.
Think of the state as a combination of the current speed and the time elapsed so far, and formulate the transition relationships based on this combined state.
memoize the function f(i, j) = max possible length of path segment up to i-th second with speed j
