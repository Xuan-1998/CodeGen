Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The base case would be when all the seconds are exhausted or the maximum allowed change in speed is reached
The state could be the number of seconds left to travel the distance, and the transition would be updating this number after each second.
Using a dictionary to store intermediate results with the current number of seconds and maximum speed as keys
