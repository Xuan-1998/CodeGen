Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The state would be updated by considering the maximum possible speed for the remaining distance
: The current speed, and \
Memoize the function that calculates the maximum length of the path segment given the current speed, the time it takes to travel the remaining distance, and the maximum allowed change in speed.
