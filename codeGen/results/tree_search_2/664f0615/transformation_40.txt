The time it takes to travel the distance could be broken down into smaller segments, with each segment having its own initial and final speed constraints.
The state could be defined as a tuple (speed, time) where speed is the current speed and time is the current second.
The state could be defined as a tuple (time, allowed_speed_change), where time is the current second and allowed_speed_change is the maximum speed change for this segment.
Use dynamic programming with a 1D table to store the maximum length of the path segment for each possible time, assuming that the speed is constant at each second.
