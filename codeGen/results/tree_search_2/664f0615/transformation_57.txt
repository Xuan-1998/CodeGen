The time it takes to travel the distance could be broken down into smaller segments, with each segment having its own initial and final speed constraints.
Another possibility is defining the state as a tuple (speed_diff, time) where speed_diff is the difference between the current speed and the initial speed, and time is the current second.
State: (time, initial_speed_to_current_speed), Transition: (current_speed_to_new_speed) if new_speed <= final_speed; else 0
Memoizing the function that calculates the maximum possible length given the current speed, initial speed, and remaining distance, to avoid redundant calculations and optimize the process.
