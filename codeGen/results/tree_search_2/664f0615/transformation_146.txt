Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The base case would be when all the seconds are exhausted or the maximum allowed change in speed is reached
You can consider the current speed as a state and the next possible speeds given the previous speed and the maximum allowed change in speed as transitions.
Utilize memoization by storing the results of subproblems as you solve them, so that when the same subproblem is encountered again, its solution can be quickly retrieved
