The time it takes to travel the distance could be broken down into smaller segments, with each segment having its own initial and final speed constraints.
The base case could be when the time becomes equal to the maximum allowed time, in which case the maximum possible length of the path segment would be calculated based on the initial and final speed.
state: (speed, time), where speed is within [initial, final] and time is within [1, max_time]. Transition: if the current speed is within [initial, final] and the time increment is less than or equal to 1, then the new state is (new_speed, new_time) where new_speed = old_speed +/- max_change and new_time = old_time + 1. If the new speed is not within [initial, final], then skip this transition.
Dynamic programming with bottom-up approach: Implement a 2D table where each cell represents the maximum possible length of the path segment given the current speed and time.
