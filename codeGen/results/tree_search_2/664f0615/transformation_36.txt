The maximum allowed change in speed could be used to identify overlapping subproblems, such as considering only the differences in speed between adjacent seconds rather than the absolute speeds themselves.
The base case is dp[0][speed] = 0 for all speeds.
The state could be a pair of (time, speed), where the transition relationship considers the difference in speed between consecutive seconds and the maximum allowed change.
Implement memoization using a dictionary dp[(i, speed)] = ... to store intermediate results and avoid redundant computations.
