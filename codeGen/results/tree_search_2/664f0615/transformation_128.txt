Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The final speed would be reached when the given time is exceeded
Consider the maximum possible length of the path segment as the state, where each state corresponds to a specific speed at a certain point in time.
Use dynamic programming with a 2D array to build up the solution from smaller subproblems.
