Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (current_speed, remaining_time) - The current speed of the car and the remaining distance to cover
Define state as (time, speed) and formulate a relationship between states based on the maximum allowed change in speed.
Utilize memoization by defining a recursive function that calculates the maximum possible length of path segment given the current state (time, speed) and stores the results in a dictionary for future references.
