Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (initial_speed, time) - The current speed of the car at the given time
The state can be represented as a tuple (speed, time), where speed is the current speed of the car and time is the elapsed time since the start of the segment. The next state would be determined by either increasing or decreasing the speed within the allowed change. This could lead to a dynamic programming solution using memoization.
Memoize the states as a dictionary where the keys are tuples of (speed, time) and the values are the maximum possible length of the path segment at that state.
