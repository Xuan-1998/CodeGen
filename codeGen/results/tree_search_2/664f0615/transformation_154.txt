Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The state would be updated by considering the maximum possible speed for the remaining distance
\
Implementing memoization by defining a recursive function that stores its results in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.
