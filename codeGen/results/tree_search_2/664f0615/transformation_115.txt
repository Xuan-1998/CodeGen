Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (time, max_change) - The time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed
Memoize the results of these checks for each second.
Implement memoization to store intermediate results as a dictionary where the key is the state (time, max_change) and the value is the maximum possible length of the path segment at that state.
