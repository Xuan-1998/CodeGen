Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The final speed is always reached after a certain amount of time
The state could be represented by a tuple containing the current speed and time, with transitions defined based on whether the current speed is within the allowed range of the previous speed and time.
Define a recursive function with memoization using a cache dictionary.
