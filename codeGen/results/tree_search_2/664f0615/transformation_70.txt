Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (initial_speed, time) - The current speed of the car at the given time
Consider representing the state as (time_left, current_speed), where time_left is the remaining distance to cover and current_speed is the car's speed at that moment. The next state would be determined by either increasing or decreasing the speed within the allowed change, taking into account the remaining distance. This could also lead to a dynamic programming solution using memoization.
Using dynamic programming to build up a solution from smaller sub-problems, where each sub-problem represents the maximum possible length of the path segment at a given time and initial speed.
