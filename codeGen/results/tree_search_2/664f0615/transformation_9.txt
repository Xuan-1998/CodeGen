The maximum allowed change in speed could be used to identify overlapping subproblems, such as considering only the differences in speed between adjacent seconds rather than the absolute speeds themselves.
State: let dp[i][diff] represent the maximum possible length of path segment up to i-th second with a difference in speed diff from the previous second.
consider the maximum possible length of path segments in subproblems where the difference in speed between adjacent seconds is within the allowed_change_in_speed and use these subproblem solutions to construct the solution for the original problem
Use a 2D DP table with indices representing time and difference in speed, where each cell contains the maximum possible length of path segment up to that second with the given difference in speed.
