Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (time, max_change) - The time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed
For each second, calculate the minimum speed required to reach the final speed within the allowed change in speed, considering the current speed and the remaining distance.
Use a recursive function that takes (time, max_change) as input and stores the result in a dictionary for later reuse
