Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The maximum allowed change in speed is not considered in this base case
The length of the segment where the speed is constant for every second, considering the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds should not exceed the maximum allowed change in speed.
To use a 2D array to store the maximum possible length of the path segment for each pair of initial and final speeds, considering the maximum allowed change in speed.
