Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (time, max_change) - The time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed
Memoize the results of these calculations for each second.
To use dynamic programming with a 2D array to store intermediate results where rows represent seconds and columns represent possible speeds, with time complexity O(time * max_speed).
