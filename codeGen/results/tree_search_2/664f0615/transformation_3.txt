The maximum allowed change in speed could be used to identify overlapping subproblems, such as considering only the differences in speed between adjacent seconds rather than the absolute speeds themselves.
The base case is dp[0][speed] = 0 for all speeds, since there's no segment before the first second.
Another option is to consider a state that keeps track of the maximum allowed change in speed from the previous second. The transition relationship could be dp[i][speed] = max(dp[i-1][speed+allowedSpeedChange], 0) + time, where i is the current second and time is the time it takes to travel the distance at speed.
Consider a state that keeps track of the maximum allowed change in speed from the previous second.
