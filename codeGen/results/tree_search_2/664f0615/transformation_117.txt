Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
State: (time, max_change) - The time elapsed and the maximum allowed change in speed
Memoize the results of these checks for each second.
Maintain a memoization dictionary with keys being tuples of (time, initial_speed, final_speed) and values being the maximum possible length of the path segment.
