Considering the constant speed at each second could lead to a top-down approach where memoization is used to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
The maximum allowed change in speed is not considered in this base case
State: The initial and final speed of the car, along with the time it takes to travel a certain distance and the maximum allowed change in speed between any two adjacent seconds. Transition: The constant speed at each second.
Applying memoization to store intermediate results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations, focusing on the initial and final speed of the car.
