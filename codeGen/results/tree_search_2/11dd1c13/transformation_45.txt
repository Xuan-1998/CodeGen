The optimal solution involves using both memoization and tabulation, by first filling up a memoized table and then performing a final tabulation step.
Define the state as (i, j) representing the maximum value that can be obtained by choosing an element in cell (i, j) and moving down or right. The base case is when i == n - 1 (n being the size of the grid), indicating the end of a path.
State (i, j) represents a cell's value plus the minimum sum of the falling path from its right neighbor if j < m - 1, or from its bottom neighbor if j == m - 1.
Initialize a 2D array of size n x m with zeros, where each cell represents the maximum value that can be obtained by choosing an element in that cell.
