Memoization can be used to solve this problem by recursively calling a function and storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary.
dp[i][j] = min(min(grid[i][k] for k in range(len(grid[0]))), (i > 0) and min(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(len(grid[0]))))
dp[i][j] = min(max(grid[i][k] for k in range(len(grid[0]))) for _ in range(i), dp[i-1][j], default=0)
Create a recursive function that calculates the minimum sum of a falling path by choosing the smallest value from each row and subtracting the maximum value from the previous row.
