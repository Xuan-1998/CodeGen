The optimal solution involves using both memoization and tabulation, by first filling up a memoized table and then performing a final tabulation step.
Define the state as dp[i] representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts up to row i. The base case is when i < 0, indicating there are no more rows to consider.
dp[i] is the minimum sum of a falling path that ends at position i, considering all possible previous positions
Employ top-down memoization using recursion and caching to store intermediate results.
