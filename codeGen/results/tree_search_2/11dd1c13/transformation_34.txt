The optimal solution involves using both memoization and tabulation, by first filling up a memoized table and then performing a final tabulation step.
Define the state as (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts ending at cell (i, j). The base case is when i == n - 1 (n being the size of the grid), indicating the end of the falling path.
Define state as dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j-1] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(i), where i is the current row index and j is the current column index.
Use a tabulated approach with a 2D array to store values, filling it up iteratively.
