The optimal solution involves using both memoization and tabulation, by first filling up a memoized table and then performing a final tabulation step.
Define the state as (i, j) representing the maximum value that can be obtained by choosing an element in cell (i, j) and moving down or right. The base case is when i == n - 1 (n being the size of the grid), indicating the end of a path.
State (i, j) represents the maximum value that can be obtained by choosing an element in cell (i, j) and moving down to any of the cells below it. The base case is when i == n - 1.
Create a table dp of size (n x m) filled with zeros and update it based on the problem constraints.
