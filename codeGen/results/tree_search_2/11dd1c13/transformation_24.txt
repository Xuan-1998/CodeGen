Memoization can be used to solve this problem by recursively calling a function and storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary.
dp[i][j] = min(min(grid[i][k] for k in range(len(grid[0]))), (i > 0) and min(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(len(grid[0]))))
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(len(grid[0])) if i > 0 or j == 0) + grid[i][j];
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a table with zeros and filling it up iteratively, considering the minimum sum of falling paths with non-zero shifts.
