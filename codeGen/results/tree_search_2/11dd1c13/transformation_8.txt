The dynamic programming problem can be solved using a tabulation approach, where we fill up a 2D table in a bottom-up manner.
Define the state expression as dp[i][k] = minimum sum of a falling path with k elements from rows [n-1 to i] for 0 <= i < n and 0 <= k < n.
dp[i][k] = min(min(dp[j][k] + grid[i][k]) for j in range(i, n-1)) for 0 <= i < n-1
Implement memoization by storing the minimum sum of a falling path with k elements from rows [n-1 to i] in dp[i][k].
