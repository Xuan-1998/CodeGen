To solve this problem, use a bottom-up approach with tabulation, where you start from the base case and build up to the final solution.
dp[i][j] := whether there is a subset of the first i elements that sums up to j % m
dp[i][j] := j % m == 0 or any x in range(n) for which dp[x][j%k] is True
Use a 2D array with dimensions (m) x (n+1), where dp[j][i] represents whether there is a subset of the first i elements that sums up to j % m
