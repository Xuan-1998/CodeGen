To solve this problem, use a bottom-up approach with tabulation, where you start from the base case and build up to the final solution.
dp[i][j] := whether there is a subset of the first i elements that sums up to j % m
dp[i][j] := j % m == 0 or any x in range(n) for which dp[x][j%k] is True
Implement memoization using a dictionary, where the key is the sum modulo m and the value is a boolean indicating whether such a subset exists
