To solve this problem, use a bottom-up approach with tabulation, where you start from the base case and build up to the final solution.
dp[i][j] := True if there's a subset of the first i elements that sums up to j % m, False otherwise
dp[i][j] := sum(subset(i, k, j)) for k in range(0, i+1),
Use a 2D array with indices representing the elements and sums, and initialize all values to False.
