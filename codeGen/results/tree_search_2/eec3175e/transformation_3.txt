The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by breaking it down into smaller subproblems, where each subproblem is defined as the sum of a subset of the given set being divisible by m.
The state is dp[k] indicating whether the k-th element in the set can be included in the subset for which the sum is divisible by m.
dp[i] indicates whether there exists a subset of the first i elements with sum divisible by m, considering not including the ith element.
Use a bottom-up approach to fill up the dp array where each cell represents the maximum size of subset whose sum is divisible by m, considering only elements up to that index.
