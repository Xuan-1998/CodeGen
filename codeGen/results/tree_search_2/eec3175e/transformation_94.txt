To solve this problem, use a bottom-up approach with tabulation, where you start from the base case and build up to the final solution.
dp[i][j] := 1 if subset of elements in range [0, i) with sum j % m exists, else 0
dp[i][j] := 1 if sum of subset of elements in range [0, i) divisible by m and j < m; else 0
Applying the bottom-up approach by filling up the dp table row by row, starting from the base case dp[0][0] = 1, and then using previously computed values to compute the current value.
