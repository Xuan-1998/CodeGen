The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by breaking it down into smaller subproblems, where each subproblem is defined as the sum of a subset of the given set being divisible by m.
The state is dp[k] indicating whether the k-th element in the set can be included in the subset for which the sum is divisible by m.
dp[i][j] represents whether the sum of the first j elements from the set (0-indexed) is divisible by m, considering the jth element in the subset.
Use a 2D array to store dp values with dimensions n+1 x (m+1), where dp[i][j] represents whether the sum of the first i elements is divisible by j.
