Consider using memoization to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computations.
\
Represent the state as the remainder of the sum when divided by m. The transition relationship can be defined as the new remainder after adding the next element in the array.
Employ dynamic programming with two arrays, one for storing the minimum number of elements required to reach each remainder modulo m, and another for storing whether it's possible to reach that remainder at all.
