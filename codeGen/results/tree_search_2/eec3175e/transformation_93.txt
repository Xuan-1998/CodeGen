To solve this problem, use a bottom-up approach with tabulation, where you start from the base case and build up to the final solution.
dp[i][j] := 1 if subset of elements in range [0, i) with sum j % m exists, else 0
dp[i][j] := 1 if sum of subset of elements in range [0, i) divisible by m and j < m; else 0
Using a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table dp where dp[i][j] represents whether there is a subset of the first i elements with sum j % m.
