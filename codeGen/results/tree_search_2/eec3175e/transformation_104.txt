To solve this problem, use a bottom-up approach with tabulation, where you start from the base case and build up to the final solution.
dp[i][j] := whether there is a subset of the first i elements that sums up to j % m
dp[i][j] := j % m == 0 or any x in range(n) for which dp[x][j%k] is True
Use a 2D array with dimensions (n+1) x (m), where dp[i][j] represents whether there is a subset of the first i elements that sums up to j % m
