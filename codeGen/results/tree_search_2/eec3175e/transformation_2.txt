The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by breaking it down into smaller subproblems, where each subproblem is defined as the sum of a subset of the given set being divisible by m.
The state is dp[k] indicating whether the k-th element in the set can be included in the subset for which the sum is divisible by m.
dp[i] represents whether the sum of the first i elements is divisible by m, considering including the ith element.
Use a bottom-up approach and fill up the dp table in order, considering each element's contribution to the total sum being divisible by m
