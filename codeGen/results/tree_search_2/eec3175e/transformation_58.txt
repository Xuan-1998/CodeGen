Consider using memoization to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computations.

A possible state could be whether we have reached a multiple of m while considering the elements so far, with transitions based on whether including or excluding the current element keeps us within this condition.
Apply dynamic programming by building up solutions from smaller subproblems, with each state representing the cumulative sum modulo m.
