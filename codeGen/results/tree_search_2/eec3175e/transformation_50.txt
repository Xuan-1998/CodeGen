Consider using memoization to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computations.

Use a boolean state to track whether there exists a subset with sum divisible by m. The transition relationship can be defined as true if the current element is divisible by m and adding it to the subset makes the sum still divisible by m, or false otherwise.
Use a dictionary to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computations.
