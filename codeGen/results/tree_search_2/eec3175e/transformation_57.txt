Consider using memoization to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computations.

A possible state could be whether we have reached a multiple of m while considering the elements so far, with transitions based on whether including or excluding the current element keeps us within this condition.
Use a dictionary to store previously computed values for efficient lookups.
