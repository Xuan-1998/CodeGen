Consider using memoization to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computations.

The state could be the current sum of the subset being considered, and the transition relationship would involve checking if adding the next element to the subset results in a sum that is still divisible by m.
Memoizing the dynamic programming state with a dictionary where keys are the sums of subsets and values are boolean indicators of whether each sum is divisible by m.
