To solve this problem, use a bottom-up approach with tabulation, where you start from the base case and build up to the final solution.
dp[i][j] := 1 if subset of elements in range [0, i) with sum j % m exists, else 0
dp[i][j] := dp[i-1][j%m] || (sum of subset of elements in range [0, i-1) + a[i-1] is divisible by m)
Apply memoization by using a dictionary to store the computed values and avoid redundant calculations.
