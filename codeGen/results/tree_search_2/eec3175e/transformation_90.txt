To solve this problem, use a bottom-up approach with tabulation, where you start from the base case and build up to the final solution.
dp[i][j] := 1 if subset of elements in range [0, i) with sum j % m exists, else 0
dp[i][j] := dp[i-1][k] if j-k*m is in the range [0, i) for some k; else 0
Consider using a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table, where each cell dp[i][j] represents whether there exists a subset of elements in range [0, i) with sum j % m.
