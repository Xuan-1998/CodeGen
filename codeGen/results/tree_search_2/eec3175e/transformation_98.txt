To solve this problem, use a bottom-up approach with tabulation, where you start from the base case and build up to the final solution.
dp[i][j] := whether there is a subset of the first i elements that sums up to j % m
dp[i][j] := dp[i-1][j] || (j <= x[i-1] && dp[i-1][j-x[i-1]]);
Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table, where dp[i][j] represents whether there is a subset of the first i elements that sums up to j % m.
