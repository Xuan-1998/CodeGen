Consider using memoization to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computations.

The state could represent the remainder of the sum when divided by m, and the transition relationship would involve updating this remainder as we add or exclude elements from the subset.
Implement a 2D table where each cell represents the minimum number of operations required to reach that state
