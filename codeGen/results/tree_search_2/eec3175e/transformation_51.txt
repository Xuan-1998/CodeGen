Consider using memoization to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computations.
\
Represent the state as the remainder of the sum when divided by m. The transition relationship can be defined as the new remainder after adding the next element in the array.
Use a dictionary to store the memoized values with keys representing the state and values being the boolean indicating whether there is a subset sum divisible by m.
