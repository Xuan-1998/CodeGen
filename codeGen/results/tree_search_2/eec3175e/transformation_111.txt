To solve this problem, use a bottom-up approach with tabulation, where you start from the base case and build up to the final solution.
dp[i][j] := True if there's a subset of the first i elements that sums up to j % m, False otherwise
dp[i][j] := sum(subset(i, k, j)) for k in range(0, i+1),
Create a dictionary where keys are the sums and values are boolean indicating whether there's a subset summing up to that value.
