Consider using memoization to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computations.

A possible state could be whether we have reached a multiple of m while considering the elements so far, with transitions based on whether including or excluding the current element keeps us within this condition.
Utilize a boolean array to keep track of whether the cumulative sum is divisible by m at any given point.
