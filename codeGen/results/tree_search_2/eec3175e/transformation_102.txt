To solve this problem, use a bottom-up approach with tabulation, where you start from the base case and build up to the final solution.
dp[i][j] := whether there is a subset of the first i elements that sums up to j % m
dp[i][j] := dp[i-1][j] if j >= 0 else 0;
Use modulo operation to reduce the range of possible sums, and store the results in a 2D table to avoid redundant calculations.
