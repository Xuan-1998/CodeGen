The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by breaking it down into smaller subproblems, where each subproblem is defined as the sum of a subset of the given set being divisible by m.
The state is dp[k] indicating whether the k-th element in the set can be included in the subset for which the sum is divisible by m.
dp[i][j] represents whether the sum of the first j elements from the set (0-indexed) is divisible by m, considering the jth element in the subset.
Utilize dynamic programming with two loops: one loop iterates over the set elements (0-indexed), and another loop calculates the sum of the subset considering each element as included or not.
