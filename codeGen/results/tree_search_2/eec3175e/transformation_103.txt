To solve this problem, use a bottom-up approach with tabulation, where you start from the base case and build up to the final solution.
dp[i][j] := whether there is a subset of the first i elements that sums up to j % m
dp[i][j] := dp[i-1][j] if j >= 0 else 0;
Start filling the dp table from the top-left corner, working your way down and right, updating each cell based on previously computed values.
