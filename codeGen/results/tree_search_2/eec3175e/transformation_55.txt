Consider using memoization to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computations.

The state could be the current sum of the subset being considered, and the transition relationship would involve checking if adding the next element to the subset results in a sum that is still divisible by m.
Using memoization to store previously computed values in a cache, with a function that takes the current subset sum as input and returns whether it's divisible by m.
