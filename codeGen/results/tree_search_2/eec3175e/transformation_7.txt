The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by breaking it down into smaller subproblems, where each subproblem is defined as the sum of a subset of the given set being divisible by m.
The state is dp[k] indicating whether the k-th element in the set can be included in the subset for which the sum is divisible by m.
dp[i][j] represents whether the sum of the first j elements from the set (0-indexed) is divisible by m, considering the jth element in the subset.
Implement memoization using a dictionary to store previously computed dp values, and use this memoized data when solving subproblems.
