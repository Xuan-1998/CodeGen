To solve this problem, use a bottom-up approach with tabulation, where you start from the base case and build up to the final solution.
dp[i][j] := True if there's a subset of the first i elements that sums up to j % m, False otherwise
dp[i][j] := True if sum(set[:i]) % m == j else False,
Create a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (m), where each cell dp[i][j] stores the result for the first i elements and sum j % m.
