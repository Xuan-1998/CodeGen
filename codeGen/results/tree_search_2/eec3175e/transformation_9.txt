Consider using memoization to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computations.

You can use dynamic programming by initializing a 2D table with dimensions (n+1) x (m+1), where n is the number of elements in the set and m is the target value. The cell at row i and column j would represent whether there's a subset summing up to i*m+j.
