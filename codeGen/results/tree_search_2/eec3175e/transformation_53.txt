Consider using memoization to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computations.
\
Represent the state as the remainder of the sum when divided by m. The transition relationship can be defined as the new remainder after adding the next element in the array.
Implement memoization using a 2D array where the state is represented as the current remainder and the previous elements considered in the subset.
