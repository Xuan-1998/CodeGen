Consider using memoization to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computations.

The state could be the current sum of the subset being considered, and the transition relationship would involve checking if adding the next element to the subset results in a sum that is still divisible by m.
Tabulating a 2D array where rows represent the possible sums and columns represent the elements in the set, filling the table row by row to avoid redundant computations.
