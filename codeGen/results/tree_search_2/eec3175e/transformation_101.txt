To solve this problem, use a bottom-up approach with tabulation, where you start from the base case and build up to the final solution.
dp[i][j] := whether there is a subset of the first i elements that sums up to j % m
dp[i][j] := dp[i-1][j] if j >= 0 else 0;
Create a table with dimensions (n+1) x ((m+1)*2), where the first n rows represent the elements and the last row represents the base case.
