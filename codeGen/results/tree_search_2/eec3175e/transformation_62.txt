Consider using memoization to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computations.

The state could represent the remainder of the sum when divided by m, and the transition relationship would involve updating this remainder as we add or exclude elements from the subset.
Apply memoization by storing and reusing previously computed values in a dictionary
