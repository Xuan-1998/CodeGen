The optimal substructure of this problem is not immediately clear, but it might involve breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems that are related to each other. This could lead to a top-down approach with memoization being used.
dp(i) = max number of points earned by deleting elements up to ai, considering all possible deletion combinations for a subsequence ending at ai.
Consider the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements up to ai as dp(i) = max(dp(i-1), dp(i-2) + (ai - 1)), where the maximum is taken over all possible deletion combinations for a subsequence ending at ai.
Design a top-down approach using a recursive function and memoize it to store the results of subproblems.
