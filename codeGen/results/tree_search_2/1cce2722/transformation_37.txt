Consider the fact that the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the sequence is equivalent to finding the minimum number of non-deleted elements. A bottom-up approach with tabulation might be more suitable for this problem as we can iterate through the sequence and calculate the minimum number of non-deleted elements.
The state expression is dp[i] = 1 + sum(dp[j]) for all j in [k-2,k+2], where k is such that ak <= ai and k is minimized. Base case: dp[0] = n, since the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the sequence is equivalent to finding the minimum number of non-deleted elements.
dp[i] = min(dp[j]) for all j in [k-2, k+2], where k is such that ak <= ai
Apply memoization to optimize the recursive solution
