The optimal substructure of this problem is not immediately clear, but it might involve breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems that are related to each other. This could lead to a top-down approach with memoization being used.
Consider state dp[i] as representing the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the sequence up to index i.
The current state is dp[i] = 1 if all elements up to index i are equal to ai else dp[i-1] and the transition relationship is comparing the current element with the previous ones.
Use dynamic programming to create a table where each row represents the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the sequence up to the corresponding index.
