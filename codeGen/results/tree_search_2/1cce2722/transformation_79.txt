The optimal substructure of this problem is not immediately clear, but it might involve breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems that are related to each other. This could lead to a top-down approach with memoization being used.
Consider state dp[i] as representing the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the sequence up to index i.
Let's consider dp[i] as representing the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the sequence up to index i. Then, we can have state transitions like if a[i] % 2 == 0 then dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (a[i] - 1) else dp[i] = dp[i-1].
Use memoization within a recursive function to solve the problem
