Since we can delete elements at most once, there might be an overlap in subproblems when choosing whether to delete a certain element or not. This suggests that top-down approach with memoization could be used.
The state is the number of elements left in the sequence, i.e., 0 <= s <= n-1; The maximum points earned with s elements remaining are dp[s].
dp[s] = max(dp[s-2] + s if s >= 2 else 0, dp[s-1] + 1 if s > 0 else 0)
Implement memoization using a recursive function with a dictionary to store intermediate results
