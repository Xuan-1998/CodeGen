Consider the fact that the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the sequence is equivalent to finding the minimum number of non-deleted elements. A bottom-up approach with tabulation might be more suitable for this problem as we can iterate through the sequence and calculate the minimum number of non-deleted elements.
The state expression is dp[i] = minimum number of non-deleted elements up to index i. Base case: dp[0] = n, since the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the sequence is equivalent to finding the minimum number of non-deleted elements.
dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) for all i
Use memoization to store the calculated values in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.
