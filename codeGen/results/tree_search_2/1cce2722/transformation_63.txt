The optimal substructure of this problem is not immediately clear, but it might involve breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems that are related to each other. This could lead to a top-down approach with memoization being used.
Define dp(i) as the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from a subsequence a0 to ai.
dp(i) could represent the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from a subsequence a0 to ai, considering only ai as the last element that has been deleted.
DP solution with bottom-up approach using tabulation: Initialize dp array of size n+1 and fill it in a bottom-up manner by considering the maximum points that can be earned for each subsequence from a0 to ai.
