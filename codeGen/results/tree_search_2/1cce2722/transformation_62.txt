The optimal substructure of this problem is not immediately clear, but it might involve breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems that are related to each other. This could lead to a top-down approach with memoization being used.
dp(i) = max number of points earned by deleting elements up to ai, considering all possible deletion combinations for a subsequence ending at ai.
Consider dp(i) as the sum of the maximum number of points earned by deleting elements up to i-1, and the maximum number of points earned by deleting elements from i+2 onwards, considering all possible deletion combinations for a subsequence ending at ai.
Utilize iterative memoization
