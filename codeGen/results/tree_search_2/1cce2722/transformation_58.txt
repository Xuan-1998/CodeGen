The optimal substructure of this problem is not immediately clear, but it might involve breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems that are related to each other. This could lead to a top-down approach with memoization being used.
dp(i) = max number of points earned by deleting elements up to ai, considering all possible deletion combinations for a subsequence ending at ai.
Formulate state and transition relationships in terms of the current element ai and its two neighbors, ak and al. Consider the different scenarios that can occur based on whether any of these elements are deleted.
To use memoization in a recursive function by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary to avoid redundant computation and reduce time complexity.
