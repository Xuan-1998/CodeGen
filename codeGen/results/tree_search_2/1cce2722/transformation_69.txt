The optimal substructure of this problem is not immediately clear, but it might involve breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems that are related to each other. This could lead to a top-down approach with memoization being used.
Define dp(i) as the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from a subsequence a0 to ai.
dp(i) could represent the maximum number of points that can be earned by either deleting ai, or not deleting it, considering only the remaining elements in the subsequence a0 to i-1.
Use memoization with a bottom-up approach by iterating over the sequence and updating the dynamic programming table.
