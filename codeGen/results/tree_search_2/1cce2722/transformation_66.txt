The optimal substructure of this problem is not immediately clear, but it might involve breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems that are related to each other. This could lead to a top-down approach with memoization being used.
Define dp(i) as the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from a subsequence a0 to ai.
Consider dp(i) as the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from a subsequence a0 to ai-1, and then add or subtract 1 based on whether ai is equal to ak+1 or ak-1 for some k.
Consider implementing dp[i] as the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from a subsequence a0 to ai-1 and then add or subtract 1 based on whether ai is equal to ak+1 or ak-1 for some k.
