Consider the fact that the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the sequence is equivalent to finding the minimum number of non-deleted elements. A bottom-up approach with tabulation might be more suitable for this problem as we can iterate through the sequence and calculate the minimum number of non-deleted elements.
The state expression is dp[i] = 1 + min(dp[j] for j in [i-2,i+2]) if ai == ak+1 or ai == ak-1, otherwise dp[i] = n. Base case: dp[0] = n, since the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the sequence is equivalent to finding the minimum number of non-deleted elements.
dp[i] = min(dp[j] for j in range(max(0, i-2), min(n, i+2))) if a[i] == a[k+1] or a[i] == a[k-1], otherwise dp[i] = n
Tabulate the solution by creating an array to store the values of dp[i] for each i.
