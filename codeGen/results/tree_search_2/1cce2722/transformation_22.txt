Since we can delete elements at most once, there might be an overlap in subproblems when choosing whether to delete a certain element or not. This suggests that top-down approach with memoization could be used.
The state is the sum of all elements in the sequence seen so far, and whether it has been fully used to form a complete arithmetic sequence; The base case is when all elements have been processed.
The state is the sum of all elements in the sequence seen so far, and the last element chosen for deletion; The base case is when all elements have been processed.
Applying a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by iterating over the sequence and filling up a 2D table.
