The optimal substructure of this problem is not immediately clear, but it might involve breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems that are related to each other. This could lead to a top-down approach with memoization being used.
Consider state dp[i] as representing the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the sequence up to index i.
The current state is dp[i] = max(dp[j-1] + (a[i] - 1) if a[i] % 2 == 0 else 1 for j in range(1, i+1)) and the transition relationship is the maximum of this state from previous states.
Applying memoization using recursive function: Define a recursive function that takes an index i and returns the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the sequence up to index i, then use memoization to store the results of subproblems.
