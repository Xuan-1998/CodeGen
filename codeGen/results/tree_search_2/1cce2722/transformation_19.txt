Since we can delete elements at most once, there might be an overlap in subproblems when choosing whether to delete a certain element or not. This suggests that top-down approach with memoization could be used.
The state is the sum of all elements in the sequence seen so far, and whether it has been fully used to form a complete arithmetic sequence; The base case is when all elements have been processed.

To implement tabulation using a bottom-up approach where we fill in a 2D table to store the maximum points for each subproblem
