Use a 2D DP table where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps needed to reach cell (i, j) with exactly K coins. The base case would be when i == N-1 and j == N-1, in which case dp[N-1][N-1] = 0. Then fill up the DP table by considering all possible moves from each cell.
dp[i][j] represents whether there is a valid path to cell (i, j) with exactly K coins.
Use a 2D DP table where each cell dp[i][j] represents the total number of paths that reach cell (i, j) with exactly K coins, considering only the number of coins in each cell.
Define a recursive function that takes the current cell, remaining coins, and the total number of paths as arguments.
