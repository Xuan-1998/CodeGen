Use a 2D DP table where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps needed to reach cell (i, j) with exactly K coins. The base case would be when i == N-1 and j == N-1, in which case dp[N-1][N-1] = 0. Then fill up the DP table by considering all possible moves from each cell.
dp[i][j] represents the number of valid paths to cell (i, j) with exactly K coins.
Use a 3D DP table where each cell dp[i][j][k] represents the number of valid paths to cell (i, j) with exactly k coins.
To implement memoization using a dictionary to store and reuse previously computed values.
