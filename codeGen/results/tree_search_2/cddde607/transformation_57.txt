Consider a 2D DP table where each cell dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to reach cell (i, j) with exactly K coins. The base case would be when i == N-1 and j == N-1, in which case dp[N-1][N-1] = true if it's possible to collect exactly K coins from cells (0, 0) to (N-1, N-1).
dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to reach cell (i, j) with exactly K coins.
Formulate state and transition relationships: let state dp[i][j] represent whether it's possible to collect exactly K coins by reaching cell (i, j). Transition relation: if there are k coins in cell (i, j), then the number of ways to reach this cell is equal to 1 if k equals the total number of coins in all cells below and to the right of cell (i, j), otherwise it's 0.
Use a bottom-up approach with a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to reach cell (i, j) with exactly K coins.
