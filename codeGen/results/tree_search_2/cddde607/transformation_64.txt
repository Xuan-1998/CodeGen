Consider a 2D DP table where each cell dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to reach cell (i, j) with exactly K coins. The base case would be when i == N-1 and j == N-1, in which case dp[N-1][N-1] = true if it's possible to collect exactly K coins from cells (0, 0) to (N-1, N-1).
dp[i][j] is true if the current cell has K - arr[i][j] coins left to collect and either i == N-1 or j == N-1.
dp[i][j] is true if the current cell has at least K - arr[i][j] coins left to collect and the minimum number of steps required to reach this cell from the top-left corner is dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1].
Dynamically update the DP table by considering all possible moves from each cell: For each cell (i, j), calculate the minimum number of steps required to reach this cell from the top-left corner, considering all possible moves (right or down) from the previous cells.
