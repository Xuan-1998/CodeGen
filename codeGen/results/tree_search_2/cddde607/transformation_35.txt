Use a 2D DP table where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps needed to reach cell (i, j) with exactly K coins. The base case would be when i == N-1 and j == N-1, in which case dp[N-1][N-1] = 0. Then fill up the DP table by considering all possible moves from each cell.
dp[i][j] represents whether there is a valid path to cell (i, j) with exactly K coins.
Create a 2D DP table where each cell dp[i][j] represents whether there is a valid path to cell (i, j) with exactly K - arr[i][j] coins, considering only the number of coins in each cell.
Implement tabulation using a 2D table where dp[i][j] represents the number of valid paths to cell (i, j) with exactly K - arr[i][j] coins
