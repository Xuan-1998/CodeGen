Consider a 2D DP table where each cell dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to reach cell (i, j) with exactly K coins. The base case would be when i == N-1 and j == N-1, in which case dp[N-1][N-1] = true if it's possible to collect exactly K coins from cells (0, 0) to (N-1, N-1).
dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to reach cell (i, j) with exactly K coins.
Formulate state and transition relationships: let state dp[i][j] represent whether it's possible to collect exactly K coins by reaching cell (i, j). Transition relation: if there are k coins in cell (i, j), then the number of ways to reach this cell is the sum of the number of ways to reach cells above and to the left.
Tabulate the solution using a 2D DP table where each cell represents whether it's possible to reach that cell with exactly K coins.,
