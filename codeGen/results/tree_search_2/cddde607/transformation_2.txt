Consider a 2D DP table where each cell dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to reach cell (i, j) with exactly K coins. The base case would be when i == N-1 and j == N-1, in which case dp[N-1][N-1] = count the number of ways to collect exactly K coins from cells (0, 0) to (N-1, N-1).
dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to reach cell (i, j) with exactly K coins.
To consider whether we have reached a cell that has at least as many coins as needed for the remaining part of the path.
Initialize a 2D array with a prefix sum approach and use it as a memoized storage for subproblems.
