Let the state be dp[i] = the maximum number of times the array can be partitioned up to index i, considering all possible partitions that end at i.
dp[i] = max(1 + dp[k]) for k in range(0, i//2+1) if sum(arr[:k]) == sum(arr[k:])
Tabulation approach: Use a bottom-up tabulation to fill the table based on the state transition.
