The base case is when the array has only one element or an empty array, return 0. Then for each test case, we calculate the total sum and then the maximum possible partitions.
The state could be a pair (left_sum, right_sum), representing the cumulative sums of elements on the left and right sides of the current partition. The transitions would involve calculating the new partitions based on the sums.
Employ tabulation using a 1D array to store the maximum number of times the array can be partitioned up to the current position.
