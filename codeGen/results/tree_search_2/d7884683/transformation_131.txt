Define the state expression as dp[i] = maximum partitioning for array indices 0 to i, where state is initially unknown and transitions are based on whether the sum of elements up to index i-1 is equal to the sum of elements from 0 to n-1. The base case would be when the array has only one element.
dp[i] = max(dp[j-1] + 1, i-j+1) if sum(arr[:i]) == sum(arr[i:]) else dp[i-1]
Create a 2D array where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum partitioning for indices i-j+1 to i, and fill it up iteratively.
