Consider a base case: when the input array only contains one element, it cannot be partitioned. So, the state expression is dp[n-1] = 0 and the base case is when n == 1.
dp[i] = max(dp[j], 0) for all j such that 0 <= j < i and sum(arr[:j]) == sum(arr[j:])
Memoize the maximum number of times the array can be partitioned using a dictionary, where the key is the current sum and the value is the corresponding count.
