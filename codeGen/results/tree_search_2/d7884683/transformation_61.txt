Define the state as the number of times the array can be partitioned so far, along with the current index.
The state is a tuple (partition_count, index), where partition_count is the number of times the array can be partitioned and index is the current position.
Employ a dictionary to memoize the results of subproblems, where the key is the state and the value is the partition count.
