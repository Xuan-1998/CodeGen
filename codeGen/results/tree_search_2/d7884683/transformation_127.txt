Define the state expression as dp[i] = maximum partitioning for array indices 0 to i, where state is initially unknown and transitions are based on whether the sum of elements up to index i-1 is equal to the sum of elements from 0 to i. The base case would be when the array has only one element.
dp[i] = max(0, dp[i-1] + 1) if (sum(arr[:i])) % 2 == 0 and (sum(arr[i:])) % 2 == 0
dp[i] = [min(dp[j]) for j in range(i)] + min(dp[i-1], 0) if sum(arr[:i]) % 2 == 0 and sum(arr[i:]) % 2 == 0
