Define the state as a pair (left_sum, right_sum) where left_sum is the sum of elements in the left subarray and right_sum is the sum of elements in the right subarray.
The state is a pair (left_sum, right_sum) where left_sum is the sum of elements in the left subarray and right_sum is the sum of elements in the right subarray, and the transition relationship updates these sums based on the current position and array values.
Implement dynamic programming by iteratively updating a 1D table dp where dp[i] represents the maximum number of times the array can be partitioned up to index i.
