Define the state expression as dp[i] = maximum partitioning for array indices 0 to i, where state is initially unknown and transitions are based on whether the sum of elements up to index i-1 is equal to the sum of elements from 0 to i. The base case would be when the array has only one element.
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], 1) if sum(arr[:i]) == sum(arr[i:])
Applying memoization to a recursive function that calculates maximum partitioning for each array index, starting from 0.
