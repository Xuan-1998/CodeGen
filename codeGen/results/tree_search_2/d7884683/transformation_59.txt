Define the state as the number of times the array can be partitioned so far, along with the current index.
The state is the current index, and the transition relationship is the maximum number of times the array can be partitioned up to that index.
Create a table where each row represents a possible prefix sum, and each cell in that row stores the maximum number of times the array can be partitioned considering that prefix sum.
