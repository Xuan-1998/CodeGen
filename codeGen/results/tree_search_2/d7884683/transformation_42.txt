Consider a base case: when the input array only contains one element, it cannot be partitioned. So, the state expression is dp[n-1] = 0 and the base case is when n == 1.
dp[n-1] = max(1, dp[k-1] + (n-k)) if n is odd and arr[n//2] = sum(arr[:(n+1)//2]), otherwise dp[n-1] = 0
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a table with size n, where each cell dp[i] represents the maximum number of times array[0..i] can be partitioned.
