State: Let dp[i] represent the maximum number of times array[0..i] can be partitioned into two contiguous subarrays with equal sum.
dp[i] = 1 if array[0..i] can be partitioned into two contiguous subarrays with equal sum; otherwise, dp[i] = 0.
Memoize the recursive function to avoid redundant calculations by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary.
