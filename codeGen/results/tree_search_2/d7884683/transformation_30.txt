The state expression is dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of times array can be partitioned up to index i, considering that j elements are on the left side.
dp[i][j] = max(dp[k][m], dp[i-k-1][n-m-1]) for k in range(i) and m in range(j) and n-j=k
Create a 2D table where each cell represents the maximum number of times the array can be partitioned up to that index, considering that the corresponding number of elements are on the left side.
