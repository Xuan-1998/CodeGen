Define state as (i, right_sum) where i is the current index and right_sum is the sum of elements in the right subarray. The base case would be when i == 0 or i == n - 1, indicating we are at the boundaries of the array.
State: (i, left_sum, right_sum) where i is the current index, left_sum is the sum of elements in the left subarray, and right_sum is the sum of elements in the right subarray.
Tabulation using a 1D array to store the maximum number of times the array can be partitioned up to each index i.
