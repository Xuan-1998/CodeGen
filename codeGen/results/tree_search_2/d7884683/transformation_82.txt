Define state as (i, right_sum) where i is the current index and right_sum is the sum of elements in the right subarray. The base case would be when i == 0 or i == n - 1, indicating we are at the boundaries of the array.
State: (i, diff_sum) where i is the current index and diff_sum is the difference between the sum of elements on the left and the sum of elements on the right.
Implement a recursive function with a dictionary-based memoization approach to store and reuse intermediate results.
