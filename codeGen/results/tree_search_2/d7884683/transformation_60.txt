Define the state as the number of times the array can be partitioned so far, along with the current index.
The state is a tuple (partition_count, index), where partition_count is the number of times the array can be partitioned and index is the current position.
Use a 2D table to store the maximum number of partitions for each subarray, with the state being the (partition_count, index) tuple.
