The base case is when the array has only one element or an empty array, return 0. Then for each test case, we calculate the total sum and then the maximum possible partitions.
Define the state as (n, total_sum) where n is the size of the array and total_sum is the sum of all elements in the array. Then, transition by updating the state to (n-1, left_sum) or (1, right_sum) depending on whether we are considering the current element in the left or right partition.
Use a dictionary memo where memo[(n, total_sum)] stores the maximum number of partitions for the array with size n and sum total_sum.
