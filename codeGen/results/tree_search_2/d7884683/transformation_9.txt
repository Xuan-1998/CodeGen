State: Define dp[i] as the boolean indicating whether array[0..i] can be partitioned into two contiguous subarrays with equal sum, and base case is when i is 1.
dp[i] = True if array[0..i-1] can be partitioned into two contiguous subarrays with equal sum, and array[i] is added to one of the subarrays.
Create a dp table where dp[i] represents whether array[0..i] can be partitioned into two contiguous subarrays with equal sum.
