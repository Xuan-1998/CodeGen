The state expression could be dp[i][j] representing the maximum number of times array can be partitioned up to index i considering j elements are on the left side, and a base case like dp[0][0] = 0.

Consider using a dynamic programming table with nested loops where the outer loop iterates over the array indices (i) and the inner loop iterates over the number of elements on the left side (j).
