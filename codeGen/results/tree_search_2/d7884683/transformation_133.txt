Define the state expression as dp[i] = maximum partitioning for array indices 0 to i, where state is initially unknown and transitions are based on whether the sum of elements up to index i-1 is equal to the sum of elements from 0 to n-1. The base case would be when the array has only one element.
dp[i] = max(0 if i == 0 else dp[i-1], i // 2 if i % 2 == 0 and sum(arr[:i//2+1]) == sum(arr[i//2+1:]))
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing dp with a size of n+1 and then iteratively update dp using the given transition function.
