Define state as (i, right_sum) where i is the current index and right_sum is the sum of elements in the right subarray. The base case would be when i == 0 or i == n - 1, indicating we are at the boundaries of the array.
State: (i, n_left, n_right) where i is the current index, n_left is the number of elements in the left subarray, and n_right is the number of elements in the right subarray.
Implement memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary and checking if the result is already computed before calculating it.
