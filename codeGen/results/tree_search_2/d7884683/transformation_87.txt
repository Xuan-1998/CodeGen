State expression could be a tuple (left_sum, right_sum) representing the sums of left and right subarrays respectively. The base case would be when n is odd, as there is only one middle element.
{(i, j): sum(arr[:i+1]) - sum(arr[j:])}
Utilize a dictionary to cache the computed states and avoid redundant calculations.
