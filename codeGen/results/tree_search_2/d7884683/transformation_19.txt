State: Let f(i) represent the maximum number of times array[0..i] can be partitioned into two contiguous subarrays with equal sum, and base case is when i is 1.
The state is dp[i], where dp[i] represents the maximum number of times array[0..i] can be partitioned into two contiguous subarrays with equal sum.
Use memoization by defining a function that recursively computes f(i) and storing the results in a dictionary
