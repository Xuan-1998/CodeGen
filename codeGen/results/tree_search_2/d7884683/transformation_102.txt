The base case is when i == n - 1, where the array has been fully partitioned and we have reached a leaf node in our recursion tree.
DP state: Let dp[i] represent the maximum number of times the subarray from index 0 to i can be partitioned.
Store all possible subproblems in a table and solve each one only once
