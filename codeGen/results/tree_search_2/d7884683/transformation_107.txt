\
The base case is when i == n - 1, where the array has been fully partitioned and we have reached a leaf node in our recursion tree.
DP state: Let dp[i] represent the maximum sum of elements in the left subarray that can be achieved by partitioning the subarray from index 0 to i.
Use memoization with a recursive function that updates a dictionary to store previously computed values.
