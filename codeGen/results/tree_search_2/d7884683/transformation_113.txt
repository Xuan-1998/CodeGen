Consider each element arr[i] as a pivot. Then dp[i] = max(dp[j-1] + (arr[i-1] <= arr[i])) for all j from 0 to i.
Consider a binary search approach. For each element arr[i], we can find the maximum partition number by searching for the largest k such that the sum of elements on the left subarray is equal to the sum of elements on the right subarray, considering the first i-k-1 elements as the left subarray and the last k+1 elements as the right subarray. The state transition relationship is dp[i] = max(k) for all k from 0 to i.
Implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by iteratively updating the dp values based on previously computed values.
