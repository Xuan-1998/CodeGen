State expression could be a tuple (left_sum, right_sum) representing the sums of left and right subarrays respectively. The base case would be when n is odd, as there is only one middle element.
(left_sum, right_sum) where left_sum + right_sum = total_sum
Tabulation with a 1D array to store the cumulative sum and then use that to calculate the maximum number of times the array can be partitioned
