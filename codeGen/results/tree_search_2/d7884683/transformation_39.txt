Consider a base case: when the input array only contains one element, it cannot be partitioned. So, the state expression is dp[n-1] = 0 and the base case is when n == 1.
dp[i] = max(dp[j], 0) for all j such that 0 <= j < i and sum(arr[:j]) == sum(arr[j:])
The dynamic programming approach would be to use a bottom-up tabulation method, where we fill up the dp array in a bottom-up manner.
