Define the state expression as dp[i] = maximum partitioning for array indices 0 to i, where state is initially unknown and transitions are based on whether the sum of elements up to index i-1 is equal to the sum of elements from i to n-1. The base case would be when the array has only one element.
dp[i] = max(dp[j-1], j-i+1) if sum(arr[:i]) == sum(arr[i:]), else dp[i-1];
Implement memoization using a dictionary where the key is the array index and the value is the maximum partitioning for that index.
