Define the state expression as dp[i] = maximum partitioning for array indices 0 to i, where state is initially unknown and transitions are based on whether the sum of elements up to index i-1 is equal to the sum of elements from i to n-1. The base case would be when the array has only one element.
dp[i] = max({dp[j-1] for j in range(i)}) if sum(arr[:i]) == sum(arr[i:]), else dp[i-1];
dp[i] = {0, 1} initially, then update dp[i] as i increases by checking if the current sum is equal to the total sum minus the sum of elements from 0 to i-1
