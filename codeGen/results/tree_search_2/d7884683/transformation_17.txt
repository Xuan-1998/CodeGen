State: Define dp[i] as the boolean indicating whether array[0..i] can be partitioned into two contiguous subarrays with equal sum, and base case is when i is 1.
dp[i] = any k where 0 <= k < i and (array[0..k].sum() == array[k+1..i].sum())
Create a list dp of size n, initialized as [False]*n, and use it to implement memoization with O(n) space complexity.
