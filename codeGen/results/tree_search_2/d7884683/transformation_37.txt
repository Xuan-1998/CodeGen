Consider a base case: when the input array only contains one element, it cannot be partitioned. So, the state expression is dp[n-1] = 0 and the base case is when n == 1.
dp[i] = 1 if arr[i] is the median of the array, otherwise dp[i] = dp[i-1]
You can use memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary, and look up the result for a given subproblem before computing it anew.
