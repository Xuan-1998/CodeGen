The state expression is dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of times array can be partitioned up to index i, considering that j elements are on the left side.
dp[i][j] = max(dp[k][m], dp[i-k-1][n-m-1]) for k in range(i) and m in range(j) and n-j=k
Design a recursive function with a base case that handles the smallest possible problem instance.
