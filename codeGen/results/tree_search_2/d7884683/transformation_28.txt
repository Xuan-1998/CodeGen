The state expression is dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of times array can be partitioned up to index i, considering that j elements are on the left side.
dp[i][j] = 1 if sum(array[:i]) == sum(array[i:])
Create a dictionary memo where memo[(i,j)] represents the result for state (i,j).
