The state expression is dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of times array can be partitioned up to index i, considering that j elements are on the left side.
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 if sum(array[:i-1]) == sum(array[i:])
To use memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary and looking up the solutions when needed.
