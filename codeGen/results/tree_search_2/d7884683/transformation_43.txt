Consider a base case: when the input array only contains one element, it cannot be partitioned. So, the state expression is dp[n-1] = 0 and the base case is when n == 1.
dp[n-1] = max(1, dp[k-1] + (n-k)) if n is odd and arr[n//2] = sum(arr[:(n+1)//2]), otherwise dp[n-1] = 0
Use a top-down dynamic programming approach by defining a recursive function that uses memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computations.
