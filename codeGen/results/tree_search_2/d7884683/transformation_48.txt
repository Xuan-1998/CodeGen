The state expression could be dp[i][j] representing the maximum number of times array can be partitioned up to index i considering j elements are on the left side, and a base case like dp[0][0] = 0.
dp[i][j] is the maximum value between partitioning at index j or not, considering the sum of left and right subarrays
Consider initializing dp with a prefix sum array to calculate the cumulative sum of the array.
