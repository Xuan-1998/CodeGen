Define the state expression as dp[i] = maximum partitioning for array indices 0 to i, where state is initially unknown and transitions are based on whether the sum of elements up to index i-1 is equal to the sum of elements from i to n-1. The base case would be when the array has only one element.
dp[i] = max(0, i) + dp[i-1] if sum(arr[:i]) != sum(arr[i:]), else dp[i-1]
Use a dictionary to store the maximum partitioning values as you compute them, so that you can avoid redundant calculations.
