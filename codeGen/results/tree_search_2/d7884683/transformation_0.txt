State: Let dp[i] represent the maximum number of times array[0..i] can be partitioned into two contiguous subarrays with equal sum.
dp[i] = max(1 + dp[j-1]) for all j in range(1, i) such that sum(array[0..j-1]) == sum(array[j..i]).
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where dp[i] is computed based on the values of dp[j] for j < i.
