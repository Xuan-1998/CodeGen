State: Define dp[i] as the boolean indicating whether array[0..i] can be partitioned into two contiguous subarrays with equal sum, and base case is when i is 1.
dp[i] = dp[j-1] and (array[:j].sum() == array[j:].sum()) for some j such that 0 <= j < i
Use a dictionary to store the memoized results and update them accordingly as you iterate through the array.
