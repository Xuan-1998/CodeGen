Define the state as the number of times the array can be partitioned so far, along with the current index.
The state is a pair (left_sum, num_partitions), where left_sum is the sum of elements on the left subarray and num_partitions is the number of times the array can be partitioned so far.
Use dynamic programming to create a 2D table where each cell (i, j) represents the maximum number of partitions possible for the subarray from index 0 to i with sum equal to j.
