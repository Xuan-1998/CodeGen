Define the state expression as dp[i] = maximum partitioning for array indices 0 to i, where state is initially unknown and transitions are based on whether the sum of elements up to index i-1 is equal to the sum of elements from 0 to n-1. The base case would be when the array has only one element.
dp[i] = max(dp[j-1] + 1, j-i) for all j such that 0 <= j <= i and sum(arr[:j]) == sum(arr[j:])
Tabulate the solution by creating a dp array with size n+1, where dp[i] represents the maximum partitioning for array indices 0 to i.
