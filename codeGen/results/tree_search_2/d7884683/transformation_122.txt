Define the state expression as dp[i] = maximum partitioning for array indices 0 to i, where state is initially unknown and transitions are based on whether the sum of elements up to index i-1 is equal to the sum of elements from i to n-1. The base case would be when the array has only one element.
dp[i] = max(0, i) + dp[i-1] if sum(arr[:i]) != sum(arr[i:]), else dp[i-1]
Use a 2D table to store the maximum partitioning for each prefix and suffix of the array, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum partitioning for the subarray from index i to j.
