State: Let f(i) represent the maximum number of times array[0..i] can be partitioned into two contiguous subarrays with equal sum, and base case is when i is 1.
Let p(i) represent the maximum number of times array[0..i-1] can be partitioned into two contiguous subarrays with equal sum, then the state is dp[i] = p(i), where dp[i] represents the maximum number of times array[0..i] can be partitioned into two contiguous subarrays with equal sum.
Maintain a separate array dp and iterate over the input array from left to right, updating each cell based on previously computed values.
