State: Let f(i) represent the maximum number of times array[0..i] can be partitioned into two contiguous subarrays with equal sum, and base case is when i is 1.
The state is (i, j), where (i, j) represents the maximum number of times array[0..i] and array[i+1..j] can be partitioned into two contiguous subarrays with equal sum.
Memoize the function f(i) by storing its values in a dictionary and reusing them when needed.
