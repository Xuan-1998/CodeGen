State: Define dp[i] as the boolean indicating whether array[0..i] can be partitioned into two contiguous subarrays with equal sum, and base case is when i is 1.
dp[i] = True if array[0..i-1] can be partitioned into two contiguous subarrays with equal sum, and array[i] is added to one of the subarrays.
Use a set to keep track of previously seen sums and check if the current sum is in the set before recomputing it.
