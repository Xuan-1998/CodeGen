Consider state as (i, left_sum) where i is the current index and left_sum is the sum of elements in the left subarray. The base case would be when i >= n, indicating we have reached the end of the array.
Consider state as (i, total_sum, n) where i is the current index, total_sum is the sum of all elements in the array, and n is the size of the array. The base case would be when i >= n, indicating we have reached the end of the array.
Use a dictionary to store previously computed values as memo[i, left_sum] where i is the current index and left_sum is the sum of elements in the left subarray.
