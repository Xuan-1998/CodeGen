State expression could be a tuple (left_sum, right_sum) representing the sums of left and right subarrays respectively. The base case would be when n is odd, as there is only one middle element.
{(n-1, 0), (n-2, 1), ..., (0, n-1)}
Employ a list comprehension with a conditional statement to keep track of the sums
