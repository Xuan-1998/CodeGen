State expression could be a tuple (left_sum, right_sum) representing the sums of left and right subarrays respectively. The base case would be when n is odd, as there is only one middle element.
{(i, j): sum(arr[:i+1]) - sum(arr[j:])}
Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming states, where each state represents the maximum number of times an array with a given prefix and suffix can be partitioned.
