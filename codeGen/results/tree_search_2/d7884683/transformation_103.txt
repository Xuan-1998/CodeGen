The base case is when i == n - 1, where the array has been fully partitioned and we have reached a leaf node in our recursion tree.
DP state: Let dp[i] be a boolean array where dp[i][j] is True if the subarray from index j to i can be partitioned, False otherwise.
Use dynamic programming to fill up the DP table dp[], where each entry dp[i] represents whether the array can be partitioned up to index i.
