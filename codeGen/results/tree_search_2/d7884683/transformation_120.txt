Define the state expression as dp[i] = maximum partitioning for array indices 0 to i, where state is initially unknown and transitions are based on whether the sum of elements up to index i-1 is equal to the sum of elements from i to n-1. The base case would be when the array has only one element.
dp[i] = max({dp[j-1] for j in range(i)}) if sum(arr[:i]) == sum(arr[i:]), else dp[i-1];
dp[i] = [[i, j]] initially, then recursively build up dp[i] for each possible partition from 0 to i-1 and j to n-1, ensuring sums are balanced
