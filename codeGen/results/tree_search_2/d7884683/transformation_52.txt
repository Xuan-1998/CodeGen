Define the state as a pair (left_sum, right_sum) where left_sum is the sum of elements in the left subarray and right_sum is the sum of elements in the right subarray.
The state is a pair (left_sum, right_sum) where left_sum is the sum of elements in the left subarray and right_sum is the sum of elements in the right subarray, and the transition relationship updates these sums based on the current position and array values.
Use memoization with a dictionary to store the intermediate results and avoid repeated computations.
