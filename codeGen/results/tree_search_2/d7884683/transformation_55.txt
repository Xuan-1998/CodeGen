Define the state as the number of times the array can be partitioned so far, along with the current index.
The state is a pair (left_sum, num_partitions), where left_sum is the sum of elements on the left subarray and num_partitions is the number of times the array can be partitioned so far.
Implement memoization by creating a dictionary that maps the current left sum and partition count to the maximum number of times the array can be partitioned so far.
