Define the state expression as dp[i] = maximum partitioning for array indices 0 to i, where state is initially unknown and transitions are based on whether the sum of elements up to index i-1 is equal to the sum of elements from 0 to i. The base case would be when the array has only one element.
dp[i] = max(0, dp[i-1] + 1) if (sum(arr[:i])) % 2 == 0 and (sum(arr[i:])) % 2 == 0
dp[i] = dp[i-1] if i > 0 else 0, sum([dp[j] for j in range(i)]) % 2 == 0
