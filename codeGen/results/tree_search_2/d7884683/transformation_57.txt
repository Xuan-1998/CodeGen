Define the state as the number of times the array can be partitioned so far, along with the current index.
The state is the current index, and the transition relationship is the maximum number of times the array can be partitioned up to that index.
Use a 2D table where each cell (i, j) represents the maximum number of times the array can be partitioned up to index i considering the sum of elements from 0 to j as the target sum.
