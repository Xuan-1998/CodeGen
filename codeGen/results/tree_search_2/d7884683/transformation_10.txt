State: Define dp[i] as the boolean indicating whether array[0..i] can be partitioned into two contiguous subarrays with equal sum, and base case is when i is 1.
dp[i] = True if array[0..i-1] can be partitioned into two contiguous subarrays with equal sum, and array[i] is added to one of the subarrays.
Dynamically create a dictionary to store previously computed values of dp[i] and use it to memoize the results.
