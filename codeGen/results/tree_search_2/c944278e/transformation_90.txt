The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
State: The total skill level of the current set of winning teams, and the state is an integer value.
Define a state as an array of boolean values, where the i-th value is True if the i-th team can win, and False otherwise. The transition relationship is that a team can win if it wins against any other team that can also win.
Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary memo where memo[i][j] represents the maximum skill level of teams that can win in phase i and have j teams remaining.
