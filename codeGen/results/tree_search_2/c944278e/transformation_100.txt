The optimal substructure is that the winner of one game determines the winners of the subsequent games.
Define the state expression as a binary string representing the current tournament phase, and the base case is when the phase reaches its maximum value (2^n - 1), in which case there's only one winning team.
The state is a binary string representing the current tournament phase, and the transition relationship is defined by the winner of the game at each phase. The base case is when the phase reaches its maximum value (2^n - 1), in which case there's only one winning team.\
DP using a bottom-up approach, where you fill up a table dp[i][s] representing the winning teams for phase i and binary string s.
