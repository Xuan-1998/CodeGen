The optimal substructure is that the winner of one game determines the winners of the subsequent games.
Define the state expression as an integer representing the number of wins for the current team, and the base case is when this number exceeds half the total number of teams (2^(n-1)), indicating that the team has won the tournament.
The transition relationship is defined by removing all teams that lost their last game from the current state.
To implement tabulation, we can create a 2D table where each cell represents the number of wins for a team at a given stage, considering all possible games up to that point.
