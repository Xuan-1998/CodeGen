The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
The state is a binary string representing the current round's result, and the base case is when n = 1 since there's only one team that can win.
A dynamic programming approach can be implemented by maintaining a 1D table where each cell represents the winning teams up to that point in the tournament, considering all possible outcomes of the current round.
You could implement dynamic programming using a tabulation approach, where you fill up the 1D table by iterating through each possible state and calculating the winning teams based on that state.
