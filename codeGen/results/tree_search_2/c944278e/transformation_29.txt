The problem can be solved by identifying all possible permutations of teams, then checking each permutation to see if it's a winning team.
The state expression is the current score of a team, with the base case being 0 when s = '1'*n.
\
Use a recursive function to find all winning teams, where each recursive call considers one more 'win' in the binary string s and updates the dp table accordingly.
