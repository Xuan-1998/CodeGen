The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
The state is a binary string representing the current round's result, and the base case is when n = 1 since there's only one team that can win.
State: A tuple of (team_index, skill_level) and the current binary string representing the tournament result.
Use tabulation to fill in a 2D array where each cell contains the winning teams for a given state and the current binary string.
