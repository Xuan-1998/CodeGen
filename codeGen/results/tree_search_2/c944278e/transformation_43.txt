The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
State: The current set of winning teams, and the state is a list of boolean values where each value corresponds to whether the team has won.
The state can be represented as a binary string where each bit corresponds to whether the corresponding team has won.
You could use memoization by defining a dictionary that maps tuples of previous winning teams to the current winning team, and updating this dictionary for each possible outcome in the tournament.
