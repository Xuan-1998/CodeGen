The problem can be solved by identifying all possible permutations of teams, then checking each permutation to see if it's a winning team.
The state expression is the current set of winning teams, with the base case being an empty set when n = 0.

You can use memoization by defining a function that recursively checks all possible permutations and returns True if the permutation is a winning team, False otherwise.
