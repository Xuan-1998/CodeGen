The problem can be solved by identifying all possible permutations of teams, then checking each permutation to see if it's a winning team.
The state expression is the current set of winning teams, with the base case being an empty set when n = 0.

Use a recursive function to generate all permutations of teams and use memoization to store the results of sub-problems.
