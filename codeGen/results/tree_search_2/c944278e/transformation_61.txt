The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
The state is a binary string representing the current round's result, and the base case is when n = 1 since there's only one team that can win.
State: The current binary string representing the tournament result, and the next team index
Create a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the maximum skill level of teams that can win with a given binary string s[:i+1].
