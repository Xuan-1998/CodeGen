The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
The state is a binary string representing the current round's result, and the base case is when n = 1 since there's only one team that can win.
State: The current binary string representing the tournament result
Alternatively, you could also consider using iterative dynamic programming with a for loop to fill up the dp table.
