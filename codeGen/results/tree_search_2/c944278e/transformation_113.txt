The optimal substructure is that the winner of one game determines the winners of the subsequent games.
Define the state expression as a tuple containing the current team's skill level and the remaining teams' skill levels, and the base case is when there's only one team left in the tournament.
The state could be a tuple (curr_level, remaining_teams) where curr_level is the current level of the tournament and remaining_teams are the teams that are still in the competition.
You can use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems, where the key is the state expression (curr_level, remaining_teams) and the value is the result of that state.
