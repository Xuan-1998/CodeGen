The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
State: The current set of winning teams, and the state is a list of boolean values where each value corresponds to whether the team has won.
The state can be represented as a binary string where each bit corresponds to whether the corresponding team has won.
You could implement tabulation using dynamic programming by iterating over all possible subsets of the teams, calculating their skill levels, and comparing them to determine which ones can win the tournament.
