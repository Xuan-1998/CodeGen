The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
The state is the index of the current round, and the base case is when n = 0 since there are no winning teams.
The state represents the remaining matches to be played, and the transition relationship is defined by simulating the outcome of each match.
Dynamic programming can be implemented using a bottom-up approach with a table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the total skill levels of the winning teams in the i-th round considering j as the last match played.
