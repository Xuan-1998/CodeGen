The problem can be solved by identifying all possible permutations of teams, then checking each permutation to see if it's a winning team.
The state expression is the current score of a team, with the base case being 0 when s = '1'*n.

You can implement dynamic programming by using a 2D table where each cell represents the maximum skill level a team can achieve at that point in the tournament.
