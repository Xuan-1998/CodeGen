The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
The state is the index of the current round, and the base case is when n = 0 since there are no winning teams.
The state represents the remaining matches to be played, and the transition relationship is defined by simulating the outcome of each match.
Implementing memoization can involve defining a dictionary memo where memo[(i, j)] = 1 if the team wins at the i-th round considering j as the last match played and 0 otherwise. Then, during the calculation, always check if (i, j) is in memo before performing any computation.
