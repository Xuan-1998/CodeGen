The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
State: The current set of winning teams, and the state is a list of boolean values where each value corresponds to whether the team has won.
State: The current skill levels of all teams. Transition relationship: Update the skill levels based on the tournament results.
Tabulate the dynamic programming problem by creating a 2D table where each cell represents the maximum skill level that a team can achieve after a certain number of phases, based on the results of previous phases.
