The problem can be solved by identifying all possible permutations of teams, then checking each permutation to see if it's a winning team.
The state expression is the current permutation of teams, with the base case being an empty array when s = '0'*n.

Considering using dynamic programming by maintaining a 2D table where each cell represents the winning teams for a given permutation of the first i teams and the last j phases.
