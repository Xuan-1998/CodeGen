The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
State: The current set of winning teams, and the state is a list of boolean values where each value corresponds to whether the team has won.
State: The current skill levels of all teams. Transition relationship: Update the skill levels based on the tournament results.
Apply both memoization and tabulation to optimize the solution by storing intermediate results and reducing the computational complexity.
