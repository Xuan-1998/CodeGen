The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
The state is a binary string representing the current round's result, and the base case is when n = 1 since there's only one team that can win.
The transition is to calculate the next team's index and skill level based on the current state and the previous round's result.
Dynamic programming with a recursive function, where you store the results of subproblems in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.
