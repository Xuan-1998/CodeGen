The problem can be solved by identifying all possible permutations of teams, then checking each permutation to see if it's a winning team.
The state expression is the current set of winning teams, with the base case being an empty set when n = 0.

You can use dynamic programming by initializing a table of size (1 << n) * (1 << n), where each cell represents whether a permutation of teams is a winning team or not.
