The problem can be solved by identifying all possible permutations of teams, then checking each permutation to see if it's a winning team.
The state expression is the current score of a team, with the base case being 0 when s = '1'*n.

Determine the winning teams by iterating over all possible combinations of n bits and checking if the corresponding team can win the tournament. Use memoization to avoid recalculating the same permutations multiple times.
