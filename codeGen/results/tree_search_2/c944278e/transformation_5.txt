The problem can be solved by identifying all possible permutations of teams, then checking each permutation to see if it's a winning team.
The state expression is the current set of winning teams, with the base case being an empty set when n = 0.

You can use tabulation to construct an array of size 2^n, where each index i represents the maximum skill level required for a team to win at the i-th step.
