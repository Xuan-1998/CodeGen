The problem can be solved by identifying all possible permutations of teams, then checking each permutation to see if it's a winning team.
The state expression is the current set of winning teams, with the base case being an empty set when n = 0.

Implement a top-down approach using recursion, and apply memoization to store the intermediate results and avoid redundant computations.
