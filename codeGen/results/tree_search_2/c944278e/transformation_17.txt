The problem can be solved by identifying all possible permutations of teams, then checking each permutation to see if it's a winning team.
The state expression is the current set of winning teams, with the base case being an empty set when n = 0.

Use dynamic programming to fill up a table where each cell represents whether a given set of winning teams can win the tournament.
