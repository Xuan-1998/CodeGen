The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
State: The total skill level of the current set of winning teams, and the state is an integer value.
For each possible outcome (win or lose) update the state by considering all the teams that can win in both scenarios.
Tabulation could be done by initializing an array of size 2^n, where each index represents the total skill level of the current set of winning teams, and update it based on the possible outcomes.
