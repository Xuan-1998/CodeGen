The problem can be solved by identifying all possible permutations of teams, then checking each permutation to see if it's a winning team.
The state expression is the current permutation of teams, with the base case being an empty array when s = '0'*n.

Using memoization to store previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations, with the goal of reducing the overall time complexity.
