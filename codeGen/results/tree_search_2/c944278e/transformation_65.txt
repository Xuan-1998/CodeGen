The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
The state is a binary string representing the current round's result, and the base case is when n = 1 since there's only one team that can win.
The transition is to update the state based on the current round's result and calculate the skill level of the next team.
Another option is to use tabulation by creating a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the winning team for binary string j after i rounds. You would then fill this array in a bottom-up manner, starting from the base case when n = 1 and transitioning to calculate the results for longer strings.
