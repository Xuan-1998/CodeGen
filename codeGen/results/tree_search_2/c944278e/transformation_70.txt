The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
The state is a binary string representing the current round's result, and the base case is when n = 1 since there's only one team that can win.
State: The current binary string representing the tournament result
You could use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a table dp of size 2^n, where dp[i] represents the winning teams after i rounds.
