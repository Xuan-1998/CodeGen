The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
The state is a binary string representing the current round's result, and the base case is when n = 1 since there's only one team that can win.
The transition is to update the state based on the current round's result and calculate the skill level of the next team.
You could also consider using a recursive approach with memoization by defining a function rec(s) that calculates the winning teams for binary string s and stores the results in a dictionary. This way, you can avoid redundant calculations and optimize your solution.
