The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
State: The total skill level of the current set of winning teams, and the state is an integer value.
For each possible outcome (win or lose) update the state by considering all the teams that can win in both scenarios.
You can implement memoization by using a dictionary to store the intermediate results and their corresponding states.
