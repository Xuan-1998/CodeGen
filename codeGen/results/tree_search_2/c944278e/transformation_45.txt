The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
State: The current set of winning teams, and the state is a list of boolean values where each value corresponds to whether the team has won.
The state can be represented as a binary string where each bit corresponds to whether the corresponding team has won.
Alternatively, you could use a memoized recursive function that calculates the winning team for each possible subset of teams, considering the skill levels of the teams involved in the current round.
