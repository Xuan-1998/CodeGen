The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
State: The current set of winning teams, and the state is a list of boolean values where each value corresponds to whether the team has won.
Transition relationship: Given the current state, determine if the next phase's results will change the winning teams.
Design a tabulation approach by iterating through all possible phases and updating the state accordingly.
