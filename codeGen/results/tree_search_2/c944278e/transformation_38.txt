The problem can be solved by identifying all possible permutations of teams, then checking each permutation to see if it's a winning team.
The state expression is the current score of a team, with the base case being 0 when s = '1'*n.
\
Tabulation approach by creating a 2D table where each cell represents the maximum score achievable by a team at a given step.
