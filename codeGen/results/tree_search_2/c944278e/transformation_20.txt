The problem can be solved by identifying all possible permutations of teams, then checking each permutation to see if it's a winning team.
The state expression is the current permutation of teams, with the base case being an empty array when s = '0'*n.

You can use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach, where you start from the base case and build up to the final solution.
