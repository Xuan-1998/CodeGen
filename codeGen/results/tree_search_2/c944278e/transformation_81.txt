The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
The state is the index of the current round, and the base case is when n = 0 since there are no winning teams.
The state represents the number of wins a team has obtained so far, and the transition relationship is defined by considering all possible outcomes of the current match.
A recursive function that takes the current state and possible outcomes as input, and returns a list of winning teams.
