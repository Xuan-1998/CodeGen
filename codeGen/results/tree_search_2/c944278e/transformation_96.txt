The optimal substructure is that the winner of one game determines the winners of the subsequent games.
Define the state expression as a binary string representing the current tournament phase, and the base case is when the phase reaches its maximum value (2^n - 1), in which case there's only one winning team.

Design a top-down approach using memoization to avoid redundant computations and optimize the solution.
