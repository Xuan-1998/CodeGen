The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
The state is a binary string representing the current round's result, and the base case is when n = 1 since there's only one team that can win.
The transition is to update the state based on the current round's result and calculate the skill level of the next team.
Create a tabulation table where each row represents a state (binary string) and each column represents a possible skill level, with the value in each cell being the maximum skill level that can be achieved for the corresponding state and skill level.
