The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
The state is the index of the current round, and the base case is when n = 0 since there are no winning teams.
The state represents the remaining matches to be played, and the transition relationship is defined by simulating the outcome of each match.
A tabulation approach can be implemented by initializing a table dp[2^n] where dp[i] represents the total skill levels of the winning teams at the i-th round and iterating over all possible matches and updating the values accordingly.
