The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
The state is a binary string representing the current round's result, and the base case is when n = 1 since there's only one team that can win.
The transition is to update the state based on the current round's result and calculate the skill level of the next team.
You could implement memoization by defining a function dp(s) that takes a binary string s as input, calculates the winning teams for s, and stores the results in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations. This way, you can efficiently look up the results of previously calculated states and build upon them.
