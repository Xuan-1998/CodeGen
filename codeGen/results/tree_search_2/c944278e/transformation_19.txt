The problem can be solved by identifying all possible permutations of teams, then checking each permutation to see if it's a winning team.
The state expression is the current permutation of teams, with the base case being an empty array when s = '0'*n.

You can implement tabulation by creating a 2D table where the state is the current permutation of teams and the value is whether it's a winning team or not.
