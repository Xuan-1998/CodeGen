The problem can be solved by identifying all possible permutations of teams, then checking each permutation to see if it's a winning team.
The state expression is the current score of a team, with the base case being 0 when s = '1'*n.

You can use a dictionary to store the maximum skill levels for each possible score and then memoize the results as you iterate through the binary string.
