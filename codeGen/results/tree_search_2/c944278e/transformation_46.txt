The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
State: The current set of winning teams, and the state is a list of boolean values where each value corresponds to whether the team has won.
Transition relationship: Given the current state, determine if the next phase's results will change the winning teams.
Use a 2D table to store the skill levels of each team and compare them in a dynamic programming manner.
