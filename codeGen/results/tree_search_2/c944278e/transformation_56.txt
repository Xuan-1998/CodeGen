The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
The state is a binary string representing the current round's result, and the base case is when n = 1 since there's only one team that can win.
The transition is to calculate the next team's index and skill level based on the current state and the previous round's result.
A bottom-up dynamic programming approach using a 2D table to store the results of all possible subproblems and their corresponding skill levels.
