The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
State: The total skill level of the current set of winning teams, and the state is an integer value.
For each possible outcome (win or lose) update the state by considering all the teams that can win in both scenarios.
Another approach is to use a combination of memoization and tabulation by maintaining a dictionary for memoized results and an array for tabulated updates.
