The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
The state is a binary string representing the current round's result, and the base case is when n = 1 since there's only one team that can win.
The transition is to update the state based on the current round's result and calculate the skill level of the next team.
Use memoization by creating a dictionary to store the maximum skill levels that can be achieved for each state, and then use this dictionary as a lookup table to avoid redundant calculations.
