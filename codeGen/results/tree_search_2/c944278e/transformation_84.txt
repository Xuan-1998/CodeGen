The approach could involve calculating the skill levels of each team and comparing them in a dynamic programming manner.
The state is the index of the current round, and the base case is when n = 0 since there are no winning teams.
The state represents the index of the current round, and the transition relationship is defined by the skill levels of the teams that have won until now.
To utilize a top-down dynamic programming approach by solving subproblems recursively and storing their results in a dictionary.
