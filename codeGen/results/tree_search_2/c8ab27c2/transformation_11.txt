Identify overlapping subproblems: The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that have some overlap. For example, the subsequences of length 3 in S might include some subsequences that are also subsequences of length 4, which is why we need to consider overlap.
\
Transition: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][k] for some k <= j if and only if S[i-1..i] is not a subsequence of T[k..j].
Implement memoization using a dictionary where keys are tuples of (i, j) and values are the corresponding lengths.
