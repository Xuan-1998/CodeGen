Top-down approach with memoization: You can start by calculating the lengths of common and uncommon subsequences for each pair of characters in S and T. Then, you can use memoization to store these values as you go along, so that you don't have to recalculate them later.
dp[i][j] = 1 if S[:i+1] is not a subsequence of T[:j+1] else min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1
Consider the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between S and T. Then, you can calculate the uncommon subsequences as the difference between the lengths of the original strings and the LCS.
Dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach: Use a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence ending at indices i and j in S and T respectively. Initialize dp[0][0] to 1 and fill the rest of the table according to the following rule: dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) if S[:i+1] is not a subsequence of T[:j+1] else dp[i-1][j]. Then, return dp[m][n] where m and n are the lengths of S and T respectively.
