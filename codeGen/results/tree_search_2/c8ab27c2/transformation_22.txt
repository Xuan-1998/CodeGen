Identify overlapping subproblems: The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that have some overlap. For example, the subsequences of length 3 in S might include some subsequences that are also subsequences of length 4, which is why we need to consider overlap.
Define the state expression as a tuple (k, p) where k is the length of the uncommon subsequence we are looking for and p is the position in string S.
The state expression could be formulated as a set of tuples ((k1, k2), p) where k1 is the length of the first uncommon subsequence, k2 is the length of the second uncommon subsequence, and p is the position in string S.
Use a dictionary to store and look up previously computed values, such as dp = {{}}
