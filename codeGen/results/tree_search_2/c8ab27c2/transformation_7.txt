Identify overlapping subproblems: The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that have some overlap. For example, the subsequences of length 3 in S might include some subsequences that are also subsequences of length 4, which is why we need to consider overlap.
\
State: dp[i][j] represents whether the subsequence ending at S[i-1] is also a subsequence of T up to index j.
Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] = True if there exists a subsequence in S[:i] that is a subsequence in T[:j].
