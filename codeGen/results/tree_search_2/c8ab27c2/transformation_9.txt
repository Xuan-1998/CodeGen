Identify overlapping subproblems: The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that have some overlap. For example, the subsequences of length 3 in S might include some subsequences that are also subsequences of length 4, which is why we need to consider overlap.
\
State: dp[i][j] represents whether the subsequence ending at S[i-1] is also a subsequence of T up to index j.
Create a 2D list dp where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring of S from index i-1 to i is a subsequence of the first j characters of T.
