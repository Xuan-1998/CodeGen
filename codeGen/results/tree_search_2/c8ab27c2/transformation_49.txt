Top-down approach with memoization: You can start by calculating the lengths of common and uncommon subsequences for each pair of characters in S and T. Then, you can use memoization to store these values as you go along, so that you don't have to recalculate them later.
dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1] if S[i-1] == T[j-1] else max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]),
Find all unique characters in S and T separately, then consider the number of occurrences of each character in both strings to determine the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence.
Use memoization to store the lengths of common subsequences in a dictionary as you calculate them, so that you can quickly look up previously computed values.
