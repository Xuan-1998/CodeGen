Identify overlapping subproblems: The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that have some overlap. For example, the subsequences of length 3 in S might include some subsequences that are also subsequences of length 4, which is why we need to consider overlap.
Define the state expression as a tuple (k, p) where k is the length of the uncommon subsequence we are looking for and p is the position in string S.
The state expression could be formulated as a tuple (i, j) where i is the length of the uncommon subsequence we are looking for and j is the position in string T.
Use a bottom-up approach by initializing the table with base cases and then filling it up iteratively.
