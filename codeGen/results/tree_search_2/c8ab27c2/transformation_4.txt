Identify overlapping subproblems: The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that have some overlap. For example, the subsequences of length 3 in S might include some subsequences that are also subsequences of length 4, which is why we need to consider overlap.
To define the state expression as a tuple (i, j) representing the current positions in strings S and T.
Define the state expression as a tuple (l1, l2) where l1 and l2 are the lengths of substrings from S and T respectively.
Use dynamic programming with 2D array to store the lengths of subsequences considering overlap.
