Identify overlapping subproblems: The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that have some overlap. For example, the subsequences of length 3 in S might include some subsequences that are also subsequences of length 4, which is why we need to consider overlap.
To define the state expression as a tuple (i, j) representing the current positions in strings S and T.
Define the state expression as a tuple (s, t) where s is the current position in string S and t is the current position in string T.
Implement tabulation using a 1D array to store the lengths of the shortest uncommon subsequence.
