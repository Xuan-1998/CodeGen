Top-down approach with memoization: You can start by calculating the lengths of common and uncommon subsequences for each pair of characters in S and T. Then, you can use memoization to store these values as you go along, so that you don't have to recalculate them later.
dp[i][j] = 1 if S[:i+1] is not a subsequence of T[:j+1] else min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1
dp[i][j] = 1 if S[:i+1] is not a subsequence of T[:j+1] else min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1
Use a top-down recursive approach with memoization to store the results of expensive function calls, and then tabulate the results to avoid redundant computation.
