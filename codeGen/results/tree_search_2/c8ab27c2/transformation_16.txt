Identify overlapping subproblems: The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that have some overlap. For example, the subsequences of length 3 in S might include some subsequences that are also subsequences of length 4, which is why we need to consider overlap.

Consider each substring of S as a state and define the transition based on whether this substring is present in T or not. The value of the state could be 0 if the substring is present in T, and 1 otherwise. Then try to find the shortest uncommon subsequence by traversing all these states.
Try using a set data structure to keep track of all the subsequences that are present in T, and then iterate over all possible subsequences in S to find the shortest one that is not in the set.
