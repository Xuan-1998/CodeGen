Identify overlapping subproblems: The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that have some overlap. For example, the subsequences of length 3 in S might include some subsequences that are also subsequences of length 4, which is why we need to consider overlap.

The state could be a binary array where each index represents a character in string S. If the character at position i in string S is not present in string T, then mark that index as 1 in the array. The transition would be from state (i-1) to state (i) based on whether the current character is present in string T or not.
