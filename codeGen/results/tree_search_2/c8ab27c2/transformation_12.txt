Identify overlapping subproblems: The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that have some overlap. For example, the subsequences of length 3 in S might include some subsequences that are also subsequences of length 4, which is why we need to consider overlap.

Let the state be a tuple (i, j) representing the current positions in strings S and T respectively. The state's value could be the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence found so far. Transition from state (i-1, j) to state (i, j-1) if character at position i in string S is equal to the character at position j in string T.
Create a 2D array dp of size (len(S)+1) x (len(T)+1) where dp[i][j] represents the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence ending at positions i and j in strings S and T respectively.
