Top-down approach with memoization: You can start by calculating the lengths of common and uncommon subsequences for each pair of characters in S and T. Then, you can use memoization to store these values as you go along, so that you don't have to recalculate them later.
dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1] if S[i-1] == T[j-1] else max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]),
Find all unique characters in S and T separately, then consider the number of occurrences of each character in both strings to determine the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence.
Implement tabulation by initializing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest uncommon subsequence of S[:i] and T[:j]. Fill this table using dynamic programming, with base cases for empty strings.
