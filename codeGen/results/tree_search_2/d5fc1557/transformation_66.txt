Explore the idea of using a greedy algorithm that keeps track of the current longest streak of ones and updates it as you iterate over the array, removing elements when necessary.
Consider a state variable, say max_len, that keeps track of the longest subarray seen so far and an additional variable to keep track of the current streak of ones.
State: (current_longest_subarray, current_element), Transition: update current_longest_subarray when deleting an element and updating the longest subarray containing only 1's
Maintain two dynamic programming arrays: one to store the maximum length of the longest subarray ending at each position and another to keep track of the current streak of ones
