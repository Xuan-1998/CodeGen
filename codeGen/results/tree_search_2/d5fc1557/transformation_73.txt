Explore the idea of using a greedy algorithm that keeps track of the current longest streak of ones and updates it as you iterate over the array, removing elements when necessary.
There are two possible states: either the current number is 1 and we extend the current streak or it is 0 and we reset the streak.
The state could be a variable tracking the length of the current streak, with transitions involving updating this variable based on whether the current element is 1 or 0. The goal would be to maintain the longest possible streak by removing elements as needed.
Use a dynamic programming table to store the length of the longest subarray containing only 1's, with the current element considered as part of the previous longest streak.
