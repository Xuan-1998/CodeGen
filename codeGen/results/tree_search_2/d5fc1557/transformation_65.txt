Explore the idea of using a greedy algorithm that keeps track of the current longest streak of ones and updates it as you iterate over the array, removing elements when necessary.
Consider a state variable, say max_len, that keeps track of the longest subarray seen so far and an additional variable to keep track of the current streak of ones.
State: (current_longest_subarray, current_element), Transition: update current_longest_subarray when deleting an element and updating the longest subarray containing only 1's
Implement memoization by storing the maximum length of the longest subarray containing only 1's seen so far in a variable and update it accordingly as you iterate over the array, removing elements when necessary
