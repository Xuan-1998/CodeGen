Explore the idea of using a greedy algorithm that keeps track of the current longest streak of ones and updates it as you iterate over the array, removing elements when necessary.
There are two possible states: either the current number is 1 and we extend the current streak or it is 0 and we reset the streak.
The state could be a tuple of (current streak, maximum streak found so far). The transition relationship would involve updating the current streak if the current element is 1, and resetting the current streak to 0 when the current element is 0. This approach allows us to track both the current longest streak and the maximum streak found so far.
Employ memoization within a recursive function by maintaining a dictionary dp that stores the lengths of the longest subarrays containing only 1's for each prefix of the input array.
