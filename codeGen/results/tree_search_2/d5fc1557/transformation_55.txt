Explore the idea of using a greedy algorithm that keeps track of the current longest streak of ones and updates it as you iterate over the array, removing elements when necessary.
Let dp[i] be the maximum length of subarray containing only 1's ending at index i.
The longest subarray ending at position i contains ones from indices j to i
Use a list to store the dynamic programming states dp[i] and update it iteratively as you iterate over the array.
