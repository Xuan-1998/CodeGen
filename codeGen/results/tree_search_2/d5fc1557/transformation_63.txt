Explore the idea of using a greedy algorithm that keeps track of the current longest streak of ones and updates it as you iterate over the array, removing elements when necessary.
Consider a state variable, say max_len, that keeps track of the longest subarray seen so far and an additional variable to keep track of the current streak of ones.
State: (max_len, current_streak), Transition: update max_len if current_streak is longer than max_len
Implement tabulation by creating a one-dimensional array dp where dp[i] is the length of the longest subarray ending at index i
