Consider a top-down dynamic programming approach where you recursively remove elements from the array until you find the longest subarray of ones. Then, use memoization to store the results of subproblems.
The state could be defined as (ones, zeros) where ones is the count of 1's in the prefix of length i and zeros is the count of 0's in that same prefix.
Formulate the problem as finding the maximum length of a contiguous array of 1's that can be obtained by deleting at most one element from nums.
Use dynamic programming to create a table where each cell represents the maximum number of consecutive ones up to that point, considering all possible deletions.
