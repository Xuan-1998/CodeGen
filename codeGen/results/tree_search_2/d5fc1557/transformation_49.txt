Think about using a bottom-up approach with tabulation, where you iterate over the array and maintain a running maximum length of consecutive ones. You can then modify this approach to find the longest subarray containing only 1's after removing one element from the input array.
Define the state expression as dp[i]: the maximum length of consecutive ones up to index i. The base case is when i = 0, where dp[0] = 0 if the array starts with a 0 or dp[0] = n if it only contains 1's.
Define dp[i] as the maximum length of consecutive ones ending at index i, and formulate transitions based on whether the current element is 0 or 1.
Maintain a variable for the maximum length of consecutive ones found so far, and update it whenever a new maximum is discovered during the iteration.
