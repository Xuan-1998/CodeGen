Explore the idea of using a greedy algorithm that keeps track of the current longest streak of ones and updates it as you iterate over the array, removing elements when necessary.
Let dp[i] be the maximum length of subarray containing only 1's ending at index i.
The longest subarray not containing the last one at position i can be extended by adding a new consecutive 1
Apply memoization technique by storing and reusing previously computed values in a dictionary.
