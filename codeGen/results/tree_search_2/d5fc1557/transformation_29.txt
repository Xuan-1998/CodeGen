Think about using a bottom-up approach with tabulation, where you iterate over the array and maintain a running maximum length of consecutive ones. You can then modify this approach to find the longest subarray containing only 1's after removing one element from the input array.
Consider the current maximum length of consecutive ones up to index i as the state, denoted by dp[i].
Let dp[i] be the maximum length of consecutive 1's ending at index i. Then, for each i, we can update dp[i] as follows: dp[i] = max(0, dp[i-1]) + (nums[i] == 1), where 0 represents the initial state.
Initialize a variable to represent the maximum length of consecutive ones and use it as the base case for the tabulation.
