Explore the idea of using a greedy algorithm that keeps track of the current longest streak of ones and updates it as you iterate over the array, removing elements when necessary.
Consider a state variable, say max_len, that keeps track of the longest subarray seen so far and an additional variable to keep track of the current streak of ones.
Determine the state as a pair of (max_length_of_ones, current_number_of_ones) and formulate transitions based on whether the current number of ones is increasing or decreasing
Use a rolling variable to track the maximum length of ones seen so far
