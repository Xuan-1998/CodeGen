Explore the idea of using a greedy algorithm that keeps track of the current longest streak of ones and updates it as you iterate over the array, removing elements when necessary.
Let dp[i] be the maximum length of subarray containing only 1's ending at index i.
dp[i] is equal to the maximum of dp[j-1] + (nums[j] == 1) and j for all valid j
Create a dynamic programming function that takes the current index i as input
