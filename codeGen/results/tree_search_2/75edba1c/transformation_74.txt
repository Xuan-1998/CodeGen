To apply tabulation, we can create an array where each entry i represents the number of subarrays ending at index i where the maximum element is greater than K. We then fill this array by iterating over the input array and updating the entries accordingly.
dp[i] = sum(dp[j-1] for j in range(i) if max(Arr[j:i+1]) > K)
Consider dp[i] as the maximum length of subarray ending at index i where maximum element is greater than K.
Create a hashmap to store the maximum element in each subarray ending at index i and the count of such subarrays, then iterate over the array to update the hashmap values and finally calculate the result by summing up the counts for subarrays where max is greater than K.
