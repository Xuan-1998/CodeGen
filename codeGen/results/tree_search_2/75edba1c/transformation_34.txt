To apply memoization, we can use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems as we solve them, so that if a subproblem is encountered again later, it can be quickly looked up instead of having to recalculate.
The state expression could be (i, k): an integer i from 0 to N-1 representing the current index in the array, and an integer k representing the maximum value allowed in the subarray.
dp(k) = sum(1 for i from 0 to N-1 if max(arr[i:i+K-K]))
Use dynamic programming with a 1D table dp[k] where each element represents the number of contiguous subarrays having maximum value less than or equal to k.
