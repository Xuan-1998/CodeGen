To apply tabulation, we can create an array where each entry i represents the number of subarrays ending at index i where the maximum element is greater than K. We then fill this array by iterating over the input array and updating the entries accordingly.
dp[i] = sum(1 for j in range(i) if max(Arr[j:i+1]) > K)
The state could be represented as the maximum value seen so far in the subarray and the transition relationship would update this state for each element in the array.
Use a rolling hash to keep track of the maximum element seen so far and update this state for each element in the array, then use this information to count the desired subarrays.
