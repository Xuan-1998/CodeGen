To apply tabulation, we can create an array where each entry i represents the number of subarrays ending at index i where the maximum element is greater than K. We then fill this array by iterating over the input array and updating the entries accordingly.
dp[i] = sum(dp[j-1] for j in range(i) if max(Arr[j:i+1]) > K)
Consider dp[i] as the maximum length of subarray ending at index i where maximum element is greater than K.
Use a prefix sum array to store cumulative counts of elements less than K, then iterate over the array to find all possible subarrays and update a counter accordingly.
