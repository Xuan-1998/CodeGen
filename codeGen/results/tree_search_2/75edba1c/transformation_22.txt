To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can consider the maximum element in a subarray as the state variable. This means that for each subarray ending at index i, we need to know its maximum element.
Define dp[i] as the number of contiguous subarrays ending at index i with max element greater than K.
dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (1 if max(Arr[i:]) > K else 0)
Use a two-pointer technique to find all subarrays with max element greater than K.
