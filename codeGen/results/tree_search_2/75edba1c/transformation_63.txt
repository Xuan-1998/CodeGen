To apply tabulation, we can create an array where each entry i represents the number of subarrays ending at index i where the maximum element is greater than K. We then fill this array by iterating over the input array and updating the entries accordingly.
dp[i] = sum(1 for j in range(i) if max(Arr[j:i+1]) > K)
Create a DP table where dp[i] is the number of subarrays ending at index i where the maximum element is greater than K. The transition relation could be based on the difference between max(Arr[:i+1]) and K.
Initialize dp[i] as the number of subarrays ending at index i where the maximum element is greater than K, then iterate over the input array to fill this DP table.
