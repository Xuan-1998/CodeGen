To apply tabulation, we can create an array where each entry i represents the number of subarrays ending at index i where the maximum element is greater than K. We then fill this array by iterating over the input array and updating the entries accordingly.
dp[i] = sum(1 for j in range(i) if max(Arr[j:i+1]) > K)
Consider a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the number of subarrays [i, j] such that max(Arr[i:j+1]) > K.
Use a dictionary memoization to store previously computed values for repeated subproblems.
