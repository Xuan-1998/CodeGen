To apply tabulation, we can create an array where each entry i represents the number of subarrays ending at index i where the maximum element is greater than K. We then fill this array by iterating over the input array and updating the entries accordingly.
dp[i] = sum(dp[j-1] for j in range(i) if max(Arr[j:i+1]) > K)
Define dp[i] as the number of ways to create a subarray of length i such that maximum element in the subarray is greater than K.
Iterate over the array and maintain a running count of subarrays where max(Arr[:i+1]) > K
