To apply memoization, we can use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems as we solve them, so that if a subproblem is encountered again later, it can be quickly looked up instead of having to recalculate.
The state expression could be (i, max_val): the current index i and the maximum value max_val seen so far in the subarray.
The next state would be (j, max(max_val, Arr[j])) if j > i.
Implement memoization using a function that takes the current index and maximum value as input, and returns the count of contiguous subarrays with max element greater than K.
