To apply memoization, we can use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems as we solve them, so that if a subproblem is encountered again later, it can be quickly looked up instead of having to recalculate.
The state expression could be (i, max_val): the current index i and the maximum value max_val seen so far in the subarray.
State: (i, max_val), where i is the current index and max_val is the maximum value seen so far in the subarray. The next state would be (i+1, max(Arr[i], max_val))
You can use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems as you solve them, where each key is a tuple representing the current index and maximum value seen so far in the subarray.
