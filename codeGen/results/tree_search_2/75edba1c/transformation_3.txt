To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can consider the maximum element in a subarray as the state variable. This means that for each subarray ending at index i, we need to know its maximum element.
Let the state be dp[i] = 1 if max(arr[0..i]) > K, otherwise 0.
dp[i] = 1 if max(arr[0..i]) > K, otherwise dp[i-1].
Use a tabulation approach by initializing an array of size N with zeros and updating each element based on the previous ones.
