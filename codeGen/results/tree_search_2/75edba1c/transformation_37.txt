To apply memoization, we can use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems as we solve them, so that if a subproblem is encountered again later, it can be quickly looked up instead of having to recalculate.
The state expression could be (i, max_val): the current index i and the maximum value max_val seen so far in the subarray.
State: (i, k), where i is the current index and k is the maximum value in the subarray ending at i.
Maintain a separate 2D array dp to store the intermediate results of the DP table.
