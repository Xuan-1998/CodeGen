To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can consider the maximum element in a subarray as the state variable. This means that for each subarray ending at index i, we need to know its maximum element.
Define dp[i] as the number of contiguous subarrays ending at index i with max element greater than K.
dp[i] = sum(dp[j - 1] for j in range(i) if Arr[j] > K and max(Arr[j:i + 1]) > K)
Use a 2D array to tabulate the dynamic programming state, where the rows represent the maximum elements in the subarrays and the columns represent the indices of the array
