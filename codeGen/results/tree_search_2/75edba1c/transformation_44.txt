To apply memoization, we can use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems as we solve them, so that if a subproblem is encountered again later, it can be quickly looked up instead of having to recalculate.
The state expression could be (i, max_val): the current index i and the maximum value max_val seen so far in the subarray.
State: i, k), where i is the current index and k is the given value to compare with. The next state would be (j, min(j-1, N), k) if j < N.
Use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems as you solve them and look up previously computed values instead of recalculating.
