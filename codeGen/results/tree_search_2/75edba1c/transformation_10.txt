To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can consider the maximum element in a subarray as the state variable. This means that for each subarray ending at index i, we need to know its maximum element.
The state is dp[i][j] = 1 if max(arr[j..i]) > K and j <= i/2, otherwise 0.
Consider the maximum element in a subarray ending at index i as the state variable. For each such subarray, we need to know its maximum element.
