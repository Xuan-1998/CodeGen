To apply tabulation, we can create an array where each entry i represents the number of subarrays ending at index i where the maximum element is greater than K. We then fill this array by iterating over the input array and updating the entries accordingly.
dp[i] = sum(dp[j-1] for j in range(i) if max(Arr[j:i+1]) > K)
Think about a sliding window that can be moved to the right, updating the state based on whether the current element is greater than or equal to K.
Dynamically create a list of lists, where each sublist represents the number of subarrays ending at that index with a max value greater than K
