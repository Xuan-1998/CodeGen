To apply memoization, we can use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems as we solve them, so that if a subproblem is encountered again later, it can be quickly looked up instead of having to recalculate.
The state expression could be (i, max_val): the current index i and the maximum value max_val seen so far in the subarray.
State: i, k), where i is the current index and k is the given value to compare with. The next state would be (j, min(j-1, N), k) if j < N.
Initialize a dynamic programming table with size (N+1) x (K+1) filled with zeros, where N is the length of the input array and K is the given value.
