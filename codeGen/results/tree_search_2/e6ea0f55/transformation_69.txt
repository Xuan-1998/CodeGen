A bottom-up approach with tabulation could be used to solve this problem by initializing a DP table with all zeros, then filling up the table using the given constraint.
Consider using dp[i][j] to store the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i such that the difference between any two consecutive elements is less than or equal to k.
dp[i][j] might represent the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i such that the difference between any two consecutive elements is less than or equal to k * j.
Tabulation using a 1D array dp[i] where dp[i] represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i.
