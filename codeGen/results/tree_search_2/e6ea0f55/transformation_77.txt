A bottom-up approach with tabulation could be used to solve this problem by initializing a DP table with all zeros, then filling up the table using the given constraint.
The base case could be when i = 0, where the maximum sum is simply the maximum element in nums.
Represent each possible subsequence ending at index i as a tuple (i, max_sum), where max_sum is the maximum sum of that subsequence. The state could then be updated by iterating over all previous subsequences with indices within k distance from i and updating the maximum sum if necessary.
dp[0][j] is updated to be max(dp[0][j-1], nums[0]) for all j from 1 to len(nums), effectively storing the maximum element in nums as the base case.
