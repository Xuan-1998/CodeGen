The top-down approach with memoization could be used to solve this problem by defining a function that takes the current index and the maximum sum as arguments, and returns the maximum sum of subsequences ending at the current index.
Define the state expression: dp[i] = {sum, last_index}, where dp[i] is a tuple containing the maximum sum and the last index of a subsequence ending at index i.
dp[i] = {max(dp[j][0] + nums[i], dp[j][1]-j+k) for j in range(max(0, i-k), i+1)}
Use both top-down and bottom-up approaches with dynamic programming, where you first fill up the dp array from the base case (k=0), then use memoization to optimize the computation of the maximum sum for each subsequence.
