A bottom-up approach with tabulation could be used to solve this problem by initializing a DP table with all zeros, then filling up the table using the given constraint.
Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i with at most j consecutive elements.
dp[i][j] could represent the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i with at most j consecutive elements, and considering only subsequences that end at index i.
Use memoization by storing the computed values in a dictionary or a cache and looking them up when needed, rather than recomputing them every time.
