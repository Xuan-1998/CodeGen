The problem can be solved using a two-dimensional DP table where the rows represent the current index in the array, and the columns represent the maximum sum of subsequences with the given constraint.
The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max_sum where i is the current index in the array and j is the maximum sum of subsequences with indices at most k apart.
Consider a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of subsequences ending at index i with a maximum difference between consecutive elements being at most j.
Use two nested loops to populate the DP table, iterating over each element in the array and each possible maximum sum.
