The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems where the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence is calculated for each possible difference between indices, up to k.
Define the state as dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i with the difference between indices being j.
dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence ending at index i such that the difference between the indices of any two consecutive elements in the subsequence is exactly j.
Use dynamic programming with 2D array to store state values and implement top-down approach by filling up dp[i][j] values from bottom-up manner
