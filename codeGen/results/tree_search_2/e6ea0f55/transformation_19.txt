The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems where the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence is calculated for each possible difference between indices, up to k.
Define the state as dp[i] which represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i, and the base case is when i = 0 or len(nums) - 1.
dp[i] could represent the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i, considering only elements with indices within k distance from i.
Employ a two-pointer approach, where one pointer is at the start of the subsequence and the other at the end.
