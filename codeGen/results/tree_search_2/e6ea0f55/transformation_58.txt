A bottom-up approach with tabulation could be used to solve this problem by initializing a DP table with all zeros, then filling up the table using the given constraint.
Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i with at most j consecutive elements.
dp[i][j] could represent whether there exists a subsequence ending at index i with at most j consecutive elements and sum at least j.
Using a 2D table to store the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at each index and with at most k consecutive elements.
