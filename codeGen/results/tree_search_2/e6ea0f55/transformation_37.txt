The optimal solution can be found by using dynamic programming and tabulation to fill in a 2D table with the maximum sum of subsequences for each pair of consecutive elements and their difference.
dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i such that the difference between the indices of any two consecutive elements in the subsequence is at most k and the current element is nums[i].
dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i such that the difference between the indices of any two consecutive elements in the subsequence is at most k and the current element is nums[i].
Implement tabulation by iterating through each index i and for each i, iterate through all possible differences j from 0 to k.
