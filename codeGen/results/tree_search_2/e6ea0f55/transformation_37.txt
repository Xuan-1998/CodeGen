The top-down approach with memoization could be used to solve this problem by defining a function that takes the current index and the maximum sum as arguments, and returns the maximum sum of subsequences ending at the current index.
Define the state expression: dp[i][j] = max_sum, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of subsequences with length j ending at index i.
dp[i][j] = {max(dp[i-k][j-1]) if i >= k else 0} + nums[i], where max_sum is the maximum sum of subsequences with length j ending at index i.
To apply dynamic programming by iterating over the indices and lengths of the subsequences, and for each subsequence, calculate its maximum sum based on the maximum sums of shorter subsequences.
