The top-down approach with memoization could be used to solve this problem by defining a function that takes the current index and the maximum sum as arguments, and returns the maximum sum of subsequences ending at the current index.
Define the state expression: dp[i] = {sum, last_index}, where dp[i] is a tuple containing the maximum sum and the last index of a subsequence ending at index i.
dp[i] = max({dp[j][0] + nums[i]} | {0 <= j <= i-k}, {{j+i-k-1}})
Use a dictionary to store the memoized results with indices as keys.
