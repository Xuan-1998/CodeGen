The problem can be solved using a two-dimensional DP table where the rows represent the current index in the array, and the columns represent the maximum sum of subsequences with the given constraint.
The base case could be dp[0][0] = nums[0] and for each subsequent row, dp[0][0] remains the same because there's no way to include more elements in a subsequence.
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][k] - nums[i-1]) + nums[i]
Use a dictionary to store memoized values and update them accordingly
