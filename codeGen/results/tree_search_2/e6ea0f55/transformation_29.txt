The top-down approach with memoization could be used to solve this problem by defining a function that takes the current index and the maximum sum as arguments, and returns the maximum sum of subsequences ending at the current index.
Define the state expression: dp[i] = max_sum, where dp[i] represents the maximum sum of subsequences ending at index i.
dp[i] = max_sum, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][max(0,j-k)], nums[i] + dp[max(0,i-k)][min(k,j)]), where max_sum is the current maximum sum and k is the maximum difference allowed.
DP with memoization: dp[i] = max(dp[i-1][max(0,j-k)], nums[i] + dp[max(0,i-k)][min(k,j)]), where max_sum is the current maximum sum and k is the maximum difference allowed.
