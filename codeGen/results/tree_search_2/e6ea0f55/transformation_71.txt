A bottom-up approach with tabulation could be used to solve this problem by initializing a DP table with all zeros, then filling up the table using the given constraint.
The base case could be when i = 0, where the maximum sum is simply the maximum element in nums.
Consider the current maximum sum as the state, and the next possible elements to add are those within a distance of k.
Use a memoization dictionary where the keys are indices and the values are the maximum sum up to that index, and fill it up using the given constraint.
