The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems where the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence is calculated for each possible difference between indices, up to k.
The base case is when k = 0, we can only consider subsequences with no gaps (i.e., consecutive elements), and the maximum sum would be the maximum value in nums.
Determine the next state as the maximum sum of subsequences ending at indices j where |i-j| <= k, and consider the element at index i
Employ memoization by storing the maximum sum of subsequences in a dictionary where the keys are tuples containing the current index and the previous index, and values are the corresponding maximum sums.
