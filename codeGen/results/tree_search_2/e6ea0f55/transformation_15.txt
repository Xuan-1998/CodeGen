The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems where the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence is calculated for each possible difference between indices, up to k.
The base case is when k = 0, we can only consider subsequences with no gaps (i.e., consecutive elements), and the maximum sum would be the maximum value in nums.
The state can be represented by an array dp where dp[i] is the maximum sum of subsequences ending at index i
Utilize memoization by storing the calculated values in a dictionary and look up values as needed during computation.
