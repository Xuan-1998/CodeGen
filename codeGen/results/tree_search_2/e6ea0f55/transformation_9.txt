The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems where the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence is calculated for each possible difference between indices, up to k.
The base case is when k = 0, we can only consider subsequences with no gaps (i.e., consecutive elements), and the maximum sum would be the maximum value in nums.
Consider a state that represents the maximum sum of subsequences ending at index i with differences up to k.
Use a 2D table to store the maximum sum of subsequences ending at each index and considering different differences up to k.
