The optimal solution can be found by using dynamic programming and tabulation to fill in a 2D table with the maximum sum of subsequences for each pair of consecutive elements and their difference.
dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i with the last element's difference from the previous one being j.
Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum sum of subsequences for each pair of consecutive elements and their difference. The state transition relationship can be formulated as: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] + nums[i], k in range(0, j+1)) if i > 0, where dp[0][j] is initialized to -10^4.
Use a 2D table with nested loops to fill in the dynamic programming values.
