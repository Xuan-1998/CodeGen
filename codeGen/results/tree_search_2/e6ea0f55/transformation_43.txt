The top-down approach with memoization could be used to solve this problem by defining a function that takes the current index and the maximum sum as arguments, and returns the maximum sum of subsequences ending at the current index.
Define the state expression: dp[i][j] = max_sum, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of subsequences with length j ending at index i.
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-k][j-1] + nums[i], dp[i-1][j]) if i >= k else 0, where max_sum is the maximum sum of subsequences with length j ending at index i.
for i in range(k+1): dp[0][i] = float('-inf')
