A bottom-up approach with tabulation could be used to solve this problem by initializing a DP table with all zeros, then filling up the table using the given constraint.
Consider using dp[i][j] to store the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i such that the difference between any two consecutive elements is less than or equal to k.
dp[i][j] could represent the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i such that the difference between any two consecutive elements is less than or equal to j.
Use a 1D table with dp[i] as the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i, and update dp[i] based on dp[i-k] if possible.
