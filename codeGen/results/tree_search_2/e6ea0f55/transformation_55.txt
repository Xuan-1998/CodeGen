A bottom-up approach with tabulation could be used to solve this problem by initializing a DP table with all zeros, then filling up the table using the given constraint.
Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i with at most j consecutive elements.
dp[i][j] could represent the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i with exactly j consecutive elements.
Initialize the DP table with zeros and fill it up by considering all possible ways to extend the subsequence at each step.
