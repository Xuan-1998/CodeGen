Memoization can be used to optimize the recursive function by storing previously computed values in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.
The state is the maximum sum of the subsequence ending at each position, and the base case is when the array is empty or only contains one element.
The transition relationship can be defined as dp(i, sum) = max(dp(j-1, sum-nums[j-1]) + nums[i] for j from i-k to i+1 if 0 <= j <= n).
Utilize a dictionary for memoization, where keys are tuples representing the current position and the maximum sum achieved so far, and values are the maximum sum that can be achieved starting from this position
