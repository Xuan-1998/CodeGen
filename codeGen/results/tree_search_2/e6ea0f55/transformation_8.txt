The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems where the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence is calculated for each possible difference between indices, up to k.
Define the state as dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i with the difference between indices being j.
Let dp[i][j] be the maximum sum of a subsequence that ends at position i, considering only subsequences with a difference of either 0 or j between their indices.
Employ a list comprehension with nested if-else conditions to calculate the maximum sum.
