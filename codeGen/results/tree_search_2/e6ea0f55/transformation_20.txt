The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems where the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence is calculated for each possible difference between indices, up to k.
Define the state as dp[i] which represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i, and the base case is when i = 0 or len(nums) - 1.
dp[i] could be the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i, considering all possible subsequences that end at or before i and the maximum sum of a subsequence starting at i.
Use a 2D dynamic programming table to store the maximum sum of a subsequence for each pair of indices and differences.
