The optimal solution can be found by using dynamic programming and tabulation to fill in a 2D table with the maximum sum of subsequences for each pair of consecutive elements and their difference.
dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i such that the difference between the indices of any two consecutive elements in the subsequence is at most k and the current element is nums[i].
Let dp[i][j] be the maximum sum of subsequences for each pair of consecutive elements and their difference.
This approach can reduce the computational complexity by avoiding repeated calculations.
