The top-down approach with memoization could be used to solve this problem by defining a function that takes the current index and the maximum sum as arguments, and returns the maximum sum of subsequences ending at the current index.
Define the state expression: dp[i] = max_sum, where dp[i] represents the maximum sum of subsequences ending at index i.
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-k], nums[i] + dp[i-1][k]), where j is the current index, k is the maximum difference allowed, and dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of subsequences ending at index i with a maximum difference of j.
Use a dictionary to store the dynamic programming state, where dp[i] represents the maximum sum of subsequences ending at index i.
