The optimal solution can be found by using dynamic programming and tabulation to fill in a 2D table with the maximum sum of subsequences for each pair of consecutive elements and their difference.
dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i with the last element's difference from the previous one being j.
dp[i][j] should represent the maximum sum of subsequences for each pair of consecutive elements and their difference, where i is the current index and j is the difference between indices.
Create a function to recursively calculate the maximum sum of subsequences for each pair of consecutive elements and their difference.
