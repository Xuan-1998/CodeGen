The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems where the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence is calculated for each possible difference between indices, up to k.
Define the state as dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i with the difference between indices being j.
dp[i][j] can be represented as the maximum sum of subsequence that ends at position i, considering only subsequences with a difference of j between their indices.
Design a bottom-up approach by initializing the dp table and iteratively filling it up
