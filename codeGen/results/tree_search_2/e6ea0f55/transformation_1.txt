The problem can be solved using a two-dimensional DP table where the rows represent the current index in the array, and the columns represent the maximum sum of subsequences with the given constraint.
The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max_sum where i is the current index in the array and j is the maximum sum of subsequences with indices at most k apart.
The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max_sum where i is the current index in the array, and j is the maximum sum of subsequences with indices at most k apart.
Use a dictionary to store the maximum sum of subsequences with indices at most k apart, and update the values as needed.
