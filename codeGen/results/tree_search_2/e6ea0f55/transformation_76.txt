A bottom-up approach with tabulation could be used to solve this problem by initializing a DP table with all zeros, then filling up the table using the given constraint.
The base case could be when i = 0, where the maximum sum is simply the maximum element in nums.
Represent each possible subsequence ending at index i as a tuple (i, max_sum), where max_sum is the maximum sum of that subsequence. The state could then be updated by iterating over all previous subsequences with indices within k distance from i and updating the maximum sum if necessary.
DP table initialized with zeros as dp = [[0] * (len(nums) + 1)], where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i and having length j.
