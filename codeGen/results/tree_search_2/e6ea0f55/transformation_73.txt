A bottom-up approach with tabulation could be used to solve this problem by initializing a DP table with all zeros, then filling up the table using the given constraint.
The base case could be when i = 0, where the maximum sum is simply the maximum element in nums.
The state could be defined as (i, max_sum), where i is the index of the last element in the subsequence and max_sum is the maximum sum so far. The transition relationship would involve considering all elements within a distance of k from the current position and updating the maximum sum accordingly.
DP table with indices as states: dp[i][max_sum] = max(sum(nums[:i+1]) - nums[i], sum(nums[:j+1]) - nums[j]), for j in range(i-k, i)
