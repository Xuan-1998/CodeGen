The problem can be solved using a two-dimensional DP table where the rows represent the current index in the array, and the columns represent the maximum sum of subsequences with the given constraint.
dp[i][j] could represent the maximum sum of subsequences ending at index i with the last element being j indices apart from the previous one.
Define state transition based on whether the current element is added to the subsequence or not. For each choice, update the maximum sum accordingly.
Maintain two separate arrays, one for including the current element in the subsequence and another for excluding it. Update these arrays based on the state transition rules.
