The top-down approach with memoization could be used to solve this problem by defining a function that takes the current index and the maximum sum as arguments, and returns the maximum sum of subsequences ending at the current index.
Define the state expression: dp[i] = max_sum, where dp[i] represents the maximum sum of subsequences ending at index i.
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], nums[i] + dp[i-max(1,k)] if i >= max(1,k) else 0), where dp[i] represents the maximum sum of subsequences ending at index i.
Create a dictionary where the keys are indices and the values are the maximum sums of subsequences ending at those indices, and then use this dictionary to compute the final answer.
