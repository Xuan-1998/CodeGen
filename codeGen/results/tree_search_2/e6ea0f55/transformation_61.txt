A bottom-up approach with tabulation could be used to solve this problem by initializing a DP table with all zeros, then filling up the table using the given constraint.
Consider using dp[i][j] to store the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i such that the difference between any two consecutive elements is less than or equal to k.
dp[i][j] could represent the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i such that the difference between any two consecutive elements is less than or equal to j.
Use a 2D table with dp[i][j] as described, where i ranges from 0 to n and j ranges from 0 to k.
