A bottom-up approach with tabulation could be used to solve this problem by initializing a DP table with all zeros, then filling up the table using the given constraint.
The base case could be when i = 0, where the maximum sum is simply the maximum element in nums.
Consider the current maximum sum as the state, and the next possible elements to add are those within a distance of k.
Create a DP table with size len(nums) + 1 and initialize all values to -float('inf'), then update the table based on the given constraint.
