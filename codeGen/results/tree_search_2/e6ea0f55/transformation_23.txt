The problem can be solved using a two-dimensional DP table where the rows represent the current index in the array, and the columns represent the maximum sum of subsequences with the given constraint.
dp[i][j] could represent the maximum sum of subsequences ending at index i with the last element being j indices apart from the previous one.
Consider a sliding window of size k+1 and at each step, decide whether to include the current element in the subsequence or not, taking into account the maximum sum constraint.
Consider using a 2D DP table with dynamic programming.
