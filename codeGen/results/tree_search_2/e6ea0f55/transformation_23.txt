The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems where the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence is calculated for each possible difference between indices, up to k.
Define the state as dp[i] which represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i, and the base case is when i = 0 or len(nums) - 1.
dp[i] could represent the maximum sum of a subsequence containing elements with indices within k distance from i.
Use dynamic programming to fill up a table dp where dp[i] represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i.
