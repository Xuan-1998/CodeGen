The optimal solution can be found by using dynamic programming and tabulation to fill in a 2D table with the maximum sum of subsequences for each pair of consecutive elements and their difference.
dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i with the last element's difference from the previous one being j.
Let dp[i][j] be the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index i with the last element's difference from the previous one being j. The state transition relationship can be formulated as: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] + nums[i], k in range(0, min(i, j+1))), where dp[-1][-1] is initialized to 0.
Use a dictionary-based approach to store the dynamic programming states and look up values as needed.
