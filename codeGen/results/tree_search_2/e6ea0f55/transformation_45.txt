The optimal solution can be found by using dynamic programming and tabulation to fill in a 2D table with the maximum sum of subsequences for each pair of consecutive elements and their difference.
dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of a subsequence with length i where the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements is not greater than j.
Transition Relationship: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + nums[i], dp[i-1][k-j]) if i > 0; else dp[0][j] = nums[0]
Use a 2D array to represent the dynamic programming table, where dp[i][j] is the maximum sum of subsequences with length i and difference j.
