The top-down approach with memoization could be used to solve this problem by defining a function that takes the current index and the maximum sum as arguments, and returns the maximum sum of subsequences ending at the current index.
Define the state expression: dp[i][j] = max_sum, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of subsequences with length j ending at index i.
dp[i][j] = {max(dp[i-k][j-1]) if i >= k else 0} + nums[i], where max_sum is the maximum sum of subsequences with length j ending at index i.
To use a dynamic programming table to store the maximum sums of subsequences for each possible subsequence length and each index, and then find the maximum value in this table.
