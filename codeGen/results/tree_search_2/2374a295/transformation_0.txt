Consider using a 2D DP table to store the count of good sequences ending at each position, where the state expression would be dp[i][j] representing the number of good sequences ending at i with length j.
dp[i][j] represents the count of good sequences ending at i with length j.
State: dp[i][j] is 1 if i divides j, otherwise 0.
Create a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the count of good sequences ending at i with length j.
