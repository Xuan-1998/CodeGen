Think about using memoization to store the results of subproblems and optimize the recursive function by avoiding repeated computations.
dp(k, n) = 1 if k == 0, sum((i+1)*dp(k-1, n/i)) for i in range(1, n+1)
DP states are (k, n) where k is the sequence length and n is the current number in the sequence, and the next state is determined by the value of n and the requirement that each number divides the next number.
Use dictionary memoization with keys (k, n) and values representing the count of good sequences of length k using numbers up to n, then update the memoization dictionary iteratively
