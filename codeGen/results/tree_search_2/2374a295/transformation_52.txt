Determine whether the problem has an optimal substructure, such as finding the maximum or minimum value in a sequence, and decide if dynamic programming is the best approach.
The base case is when k = 1, and there's only one good sequence (i.e., the sequence itself), so s[i] = 1 for all i.
Determine the maximum value of the Fibonacci-like sequence where each term is the count of good sequences ending at a particular number, and the transition relation is based on the divisibility condition.
