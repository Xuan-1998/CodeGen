Think about using memoization to store the results of subproblems and optimize the recursive function by avoiding repeated computations.
dp(k, n) = 1 if k == 0, sum((i+1)*dp(k-1, n/i)) for i in range(1, n+1)
DP states are (k-1, n/i) for all divisors i of n, where k is the remaining sequence length and n/i is the next number in the sequence.
