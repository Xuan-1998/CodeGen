Determine whether the problem has an optimal substructure, such as finding the maximum or minimum value in a sequence, and decide if dynamic programming is the best approach.
Let s[i] be the number of good sequences ending with i and having length k, where 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
We can also say that a good sequence ending with i is when each number divides i. The transition relationship would be dp[i+1] = sum(1 if j % i == 0 else 0 for j in range(1, n+1))
Implement memoization using a dictionary to store the intermediate results of subproblems and avoid redundant computations.
