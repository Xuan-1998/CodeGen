Determine whether the problem has an optimal substructure, such as finding the maximum or minimum value in a sequence, and decide if dynamic programming is the best approach.
The base case is when k = 1, and there's only one good sequence (i.e., the sequence itself), so s[i] = 1 for all i.
Design states for each possible remainder when dividing the current number by the previous one, and use these states to transition to the next sequence.
Implement a top-down dynamic programming approach with a dictionary where each key-value pair [i][j] represents the count of good sequences ending at number i and having length j.
