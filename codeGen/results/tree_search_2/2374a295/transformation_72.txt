Determine whether the problem has an optimal substructure, such as finding the maximum or minimum value in a sequence, and decide if dynamic programming is the best approach.
There are two possible choices: either the last number in the sequence is a multiple of both i and j, or it's not. In the former case, we have s[i, j] = âˆ‘_{k=2}^{min(i, j)} s[k, j/k], and in the latter case, we have s[i, j] = 0.
Consider sequences where each number is a multiple of both previous numbers, and formulate states based on whether the last two numbers are coprime, then use this information to transition to the next state.
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table with zeros and filling it up recursively.
