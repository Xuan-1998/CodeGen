Determine whether the problem has an optimal substructure, such as finding the maximum or minimum value in a sequence, and decide if dynamic programming is the best approach.
Let s[i, j] be the number of good sequences of length k ending with i and having j as its last multiple divisor. The base case is when j = 1, and there's only one good sequence (i.e., the sequence itself), so s[i, 1] = 1 for all i.
The state s[i, j] represents the number of good sequences of length k ending with i and having j as its last multiple divisor. The transition relationship is that if j divides i, then the number of good sequences ending with i and having j as its last multiple divisor is equal to the number of good sequences ending with any multiple of i that is also a multiple of j.
Use a dictionary memo to store the results of subproblems, where each key is a tuple (i, j) and the value is the corresponding result.
