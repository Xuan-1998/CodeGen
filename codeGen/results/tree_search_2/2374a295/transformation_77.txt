Determine whether the problem has an optimal substructure, such as finding the maximum or minimum value in a sequence, and decide if dynamic programming is the best approach.
For each pair (i, j), consider whether i is a multiple of j. If not, then there are no good sequences ending with i and having j as its last multiple divisor. If so, then we can choose any good sequence ending with i/j and append j to the end, yielding s[i, j] = âˆ‘_{k=1}^{i/j-1} s[k, j].
Let the dynamic programming state be dp[i][j], where it represents the number of good sequences ending with i and having j as its last multiple divisor.
Use a bottom-up approach with nested loops
