Think about using memoization to store the results of subproblems and optimize the recursive function by avoiding repeated computations.
dp(k, n) = 1 if k == 0, sum((i+1)*dp(k-1, n/i)) for i in range(1, n+1)
A combination of memoization and dynamic programming: store intermediate results in a dictionary dp and update it accordingly.
Implement dynamic programming by initializing an array with zeros, fill up the dp table based on previously computed values and then read off the solution from the bottom up.
