Consider using a 2D DP table to store the count of good sequences ending at each position, where the state expression would be dp[i][j] representing the number of good sequences ending at i with length j.
dp[i][k-j+1] represents the count of good sequences ending at i with length k-j+1, where a sequence is considered good if each number divides the next number in the sequence.
Use dp[i][j] as the number of good sequences ending at i with length j, considering only previous numbers that divide i.
Design a recursive function that takes care of the base cases and uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations
