Think about using memoization to store the results of subproblems and optimize the recursive function by avoiding repeated computations.
dp(k, n) = 1 if k == 0, sum((i+1)*dp(k-1, n/i)) for i in range(1, n+1)
A combination of memoization and dynamic programming: store intermediate results in a dictionary dp and update it accordingly.
Use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems as they are computed and return the value for the problem at hand.
