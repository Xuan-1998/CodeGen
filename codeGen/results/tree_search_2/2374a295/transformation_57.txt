Determine whether the problem has an optimal substructure, such as finding the maximum or minimum value in a sequence, and decide if dynamic programming is the best approach.
There are two possible choices: either the last number in the sequence is a multiple of i, or it's not. In the former case, we have s[i] = âˆ‘_{j=1}^{i-1} s[j], and in the latter case, we have s[i] = 0.
Look at every possible combination of good and bad sequences for the numbers in the range from 1 to n, considering that the last number in the sequence is a multiple of k.
Use bottom-up dynamic programming to fill in the table in a top-down manner
