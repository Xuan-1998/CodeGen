Determine whether the problem has an optimal substructure, such as finding the maximum or minimum value in a sequence, and decide if dynamic programming is the best approach.
Let s[i, j] be the number of good sequences of length k ending with i and having j as its last multiple divisor. The base case is when j = 1, and there's only one good sequence (i.e., the sequence itself), so s[i, 1] = 1 for all i.
Let's use a 2D array s where s[i][j] is the number of good sequences of length k ending with i and having j as its last multiple divisor. The transition relationship is that for each i, the number of good sequences ending with i and having j as its last multiple divisor is equal to the sum of the number of good sequences ending with any multiple of i that is also a multiple of j for all 1 â‰¤ j' < j.
Applying memoization to prune the search space and avoid redundant computations.
