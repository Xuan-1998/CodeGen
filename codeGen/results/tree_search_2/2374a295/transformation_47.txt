Determine whether the problem has an optimal substructure, such as finding the maximum or minimum value in a sequence, and decide if dynamic programming is the best approach.
The base case is when k = 1, and there's only one good sequence (i.e., the sequence itself), so s[i] = 1 for all i.
Choose a state that represents the count of good sequences ending at each number from 2 to n, considering the condition that each number divides the next one.
Use a bottom-up approach by iterating over all possible states and updating their values accordingly
