Think about using memoization to store the results of subproblems and optimize the recursive function by avoiding repeated computations.
dp(k, n) = 1 if k == 0, sum((i+1)*dp(k-1, n/i)) for i in range(1, n+1)
A combination of memoization and dynamic programming: store intermediate results in a dictionary dp and update it accordingly.
Memoize the recursive function calls by storing intermediate results in a dictionary to avoid redundant computations.
