Determine whether the problem has an optimal substructure, such as finding the maximum or minimum value in a sequence, and decide if dynamic programming is the best approach.
Let s[i] be the number of good sequences ending with i and having length k, where 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
A good sequence is considered as a sequence where each number divides the next one. So we can say that s[i] = sum(1 for j in range(i+1) if j % (i+1) == 0) and the transition relationship would be dp[i+1] = sum(s[j] for j in range(1, i))
Create a dynamic programming table to store the number of good sequences ending with each integer from 1 to n.
