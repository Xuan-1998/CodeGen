Determine whether the problem has an optimal substructure, such as finding the maximum or minimum value in a sequence, and decide if dynamic programming is the best approach.
There are two possible choices: either the last number in the sequence is a multiple of both i and j, or it's not. In the former case, we have s[i, j] = âˆ‘_{k=2}^{min(i, j)} s[k, j/k], and in the latter case, we have s[i, j] = 0.
Consider sequences where each number is a multiple of both previous numbers, and formulate states based on whether the last two numbers are coprime, then use this information to transition to the next state.
Consider using memoization with recursive function calls, updating the memo dictionary as you go.
