Think about using memoization to store the results of subproblems and optimize the recursive function by avoiding repeated computations.
dp(k, n) = 1 if k == 0, sum((i+1)*dp(k-1, n/i)) for i in range(1, n+1)
DP states are (k, n) where k is the sequence length and n is the current number in the sequence, and the next state is determined by the value of n and the requirement that each number divides the next number.
Create a dynamic programming table dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of good sequences of length i using numbers up to j, then fill in the table row by row from bottom up.
