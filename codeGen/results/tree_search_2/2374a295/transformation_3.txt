Consider using a 2D DP table to store the count of good sequences ending at each position, where the state expression would be dp[i][j] representing the number of good sequences ending at i with length j.
dp[i][k-j+1] represents the count of good sequences ending at i with length k-j+1, where a sequence is considered good if each number divides the next number in the sequence.
Consider using dp[i][j] = 0 if i < j to ensure all sequences have a valid starting point.
Use dynamic programming with a 2D table where dp[i][j] represents the count of good sequences ending at i with length j.
