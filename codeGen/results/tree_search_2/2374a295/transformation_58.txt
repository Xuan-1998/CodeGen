Determine whether the problem has an optimal substructure, such as finding the maximum or minimum value in a sequence, and decide if dynamic programming is the best approach.
Let s[i, j] be the number of good sequences of length k ending with i and having j as its last multiple divisor. The base case is when j = 1, and there's only one good sequence (i.e., the sequence itself), so s[i, 1] = 1 for all i.
Consider the problem as a counting problem, where you need to count the number of good sequences ending with each possible value from 1 to n, and the transition relationship is that for each end value i, the previous values can be any multiple divisor of i up to n.
Create a bottom-up dynamic programming solution using a 2D array to store the state information.
