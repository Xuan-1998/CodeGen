Choose dynamic programming approach: (1) Use memoization to optimize a recursive function, or (2) Tabulate solutions by iteratively updating an array, or (3) Convert the problem into a graph and apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find all shortest paths.
Memoize the recursive function by storing intermediate results in a dictionary, where the state is represented as (subset_sum, current_index), with the base case being subsets of size 0 or 1.
Define states as tuples containing the current sum and subset, and define transitions by iteratively generating new subsets and updating the sums.
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to build an array of all possible subset sums using a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] is the jth smallest sum that can be achieved with the first i elements, and dp[i][0] is always 0.
