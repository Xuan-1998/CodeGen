Choose dynamic programming approach: (1) Use memoization to optimize a recursive function, or (2) Tabulate solutions by iteratively updating an array, or (3) Convert the problem into a graph and apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find all shortest paths.
Represent the state as a binary vector indicating which elements are included in the subset, with the base case being when the length of the vector is 0 or equal to the number of elements.
Represent the state as a combination of two parts: the sum of the current subset and whether we have processed all numbers yet.
Represent the state as the current subset sum and the subset itself, memoizing the results for sums up to a certain value.
