Choose dynamic programming approach: (1) Use memoization to optimize a recursive function, or (2) Tabulate solutions by iteratively updating an array, or (3) Convert the problem into a graph and apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find all shortest paths.
Represent the state as a binary vector indicating which elements are included in the subset, with the base case being when the length of the vector is 0 or equal to the number of elements.
Define the state as a tuple containing the current sum, the number of elements considered so far, and the maximum value in the subset.
