Choose dynamic programming approach: (1) Use memoization to optimize a recursive function, or (2) Tabulate solutions by iteratively updating an array, or (3) Convert the problem into a graph and apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find all shortest paths.
Define the state as a tuple (current_sum, remaining_elements) and the transition relationship as recursively generating all possible subsets of the remaining elements and adding them to the current sum, with the base case being when there are no more elements left to consider.
