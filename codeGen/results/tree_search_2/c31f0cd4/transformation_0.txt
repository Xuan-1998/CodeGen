Choose dynamic programming approach: (1) Use memoization to optimize a recursive function, or (2) Tabulate solutions by iteratively updating an array, or (3) Convert the problem into a graph and apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find all shortest paths.
Memoize the recursive function by storing intermediate results in a dictionary, where the state is represented as (subset_sum, current_index), with the base case being subsets of size 0 or 1.
Use subset sums as the state variable and update it by iterating over the elements in the set, then use a transition relationship that adds the current element to the existing subsets and generates new subsets.
