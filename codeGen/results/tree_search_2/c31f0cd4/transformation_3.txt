Choose dynamic programming approach: (1) Use memoization to optimize a recursive function, or (2) Tabulate solutions by iteratively updating an array, or (3) Convert the problem into a graph and apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find all shortest paths.
Memoize the recursive function by storing intermediate results in a dictionary, where the state is represented as (subset_sum, current_index), with the base case being subsets of size 0 or 1.
Represent the state as a combination of the current sum and the remaining elements in the set, and formulate a transition relationship that updates the state by adding or subtracting the current element from the sum and recursively calling the function on the updated remaining elements.
