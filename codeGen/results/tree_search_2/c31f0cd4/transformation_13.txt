Choose dynamic programming approach: (1) Use memoization to optimize a recursive function, or (2) Tabulate solutions by iteratively updating an array, or (3) Convert the problem into a graph and apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find all shortest paths.
Define the state as a tuple (current_sum, remaining_elements) and the transition relationship as recursively generating all possible subsets of the remaining elements and adding them to the current sum, with the base case being when there are no more elements left to consider.
Tabulate solutions by iteratively updating an array: Initialize an array dp where dp[i] represents the set of distinct sums that can be generated from the first i elements. For each element ai, calculate the new sets of distinct sums for ai and ai + 1, and update the dp array accordingly.
Create a dynamic programming table where each cell represents the set of distinct sums that can be generated from the first i elements, then iteratively fill this table by considering all possible subsets of the remaining elements.
