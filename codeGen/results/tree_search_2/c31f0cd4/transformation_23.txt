Choose dynamic programming approach: (1) Use memoization to optimize a recursive function, or (2) Tabulate solutions by iteratively updating an array, or (3) Convert the problem into a graph and apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find all shortest paths.
Represent the state as a binary vector indicating which elements are included in the subset, with the base case being when the length of the vector is 0 or equal to the number of elements.
View the state as a pair consisting of the sum of the current subset and the size of the subset.
Initialize an empty dictionary and use it as a lookup table to store the cumulative sums, then iterate over the sets to compute the distinct sums.
