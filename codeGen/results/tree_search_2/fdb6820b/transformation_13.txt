The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming with memoization, where we build a table of solutions to subproblems and use this table to compute the solution to the original problem.
The state expression could be dp[n], where n is the remaining sum needed to reach N, and the base case would be dp[0] = 1 (since one way to form a sum of 0 is to not include any numbers).
dp[i] is equal to the sum of dp[j] for all j less than i such that array elements are added to get j
Implement a bottom-up approach using memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
