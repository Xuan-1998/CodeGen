The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming with both memoization and tabulation, where we first build a bottom-up solution table and then use this table to compute the final solution.
dp[i] represents the number of ways to reach a total sum of i using elements from A.
Dynamic programming with bottom-up approach
Hybrid Approach: Combine memoization and tabulation by using memoization for smaller sub-problems and tabulation for larger ones.
