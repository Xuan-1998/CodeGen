The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming with tabulation, where we fill in the solution table iteratively based on the values from previous iterations.
The state can be represented as dp[i], where dp[i] is the number of ways to form i by adding elements from the array.
dp[i] = dp[i-1] + sum(1 if k <= N-i else 0 for k in array) for i in range(1, N+1)]
Dynamically update the dp array by iterating through all possible sums from 0 to N, and for each sum, count the number of ways it can be formed using elements from the array.
