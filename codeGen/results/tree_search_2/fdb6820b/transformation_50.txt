The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming with both memoization and tabulation, where we first build a bottom-up solution table and then use this table to compute the final solution.
dp[i] represents the number of ways to reach a total sum of i using elements from A.
Dynamic programming with bottom-up approach
DP with Tabulation: Initialize an array with zeros, fill it up iteratively based on previously computed values, and finally return the value at index N.
