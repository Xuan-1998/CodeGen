The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming with both memoization and tabulation, where we first build a bottom-up solution table and then use this table to compute the final solution.
dp[i] represents the number of ways to reach a total sum of i using elements from A.
Using memoized function to store results for subproblems
Tabulate the solution by building a bottom-up dynamic programming table
