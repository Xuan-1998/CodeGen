The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming with both memoization and tabulation, where we first build a bottom-up solution table and then use this table to compute the final solution.
dp[i] represents the number of ways to reach a total sum of i using elements from A.
Counting ways to form numbers less than N
Tabulate the solution directly without memoizing the recursive function
