The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming with tabulation, where we fill in the solution table iteratively based on the values from previous iterations.
Let the state expression be s[i], where s[i] is the number of ways to sum up to i, and let the base case be when i is 0.
The state can be represented as s[i][j], where s[i][j] is the number of ways to form i using j elements from the array.
Create a 2D table dp[m+1][N+1] and iterate over each cell dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] is the number of ways to form j using i elements from the array.
