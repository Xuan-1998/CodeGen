The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming with memoization, where we build a table of solutions to subproblems and use this table to compute the solution to the original problem.
The base case could be when the sum equals N, or when there are no more elements left to add.
Dynamic Programming without Memoization: Define a DP table where each cell represents the number of ways to form N using the first i elements, and use this table to compute the solution.
To use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming where each cell in the table represents the number of ways to form N using the first i elements and then update the table based on the previously computed values.
