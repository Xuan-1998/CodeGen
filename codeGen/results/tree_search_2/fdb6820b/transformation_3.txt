The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming with memoization, where we build a table of solutions to subproblems and use this table to compute the solution to the original problem.
The base case could be when the sum equals N, or when there are no more elements left to add.
Dynamic Programming without Memoization: Define a DP table where each cell represents the number of ways to form N using the first i elements, and use this table to compute the solution.
To implement memoization by defining a dictionary called dp that maps tuples of (i, j) representing the current sum and number of elements remaining to their corresponding counts.
