The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming with both memoization and tabulation, where we first build a bottom-up solution table and then use this table to compute the final solution.
dp[i] = sum(dp[j] for j in range(i) if A[j] <= N-i), where dp[i] is the number of ways to form i.
Select the total sum value N as the state variable, and define the transition relation between dp[i] and dp[i-A[j]] for each A[j].
Use bottom-up dynamic programming with a one-dimensional array to store the solutions
