The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming with memoization, where we build a table of solutions to subproblems and use this table to compute the solution to the original problem.
The base case could be when the sum equals N, or when there are no more elements left to add.
Memoized Iterative Approach: Iterate over the array and memoize the intermediate sums. For each sum that is equal to N or less than N, calculate the number of ways to reach that sum.
Implement memoization by using a dictionary to store the intermediate results and reuse them when calculating the solution to subproblems.
