The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming with tabulation, where we fill in the solution table iteratively based on the values from previous iterations.
The state can be represented as dp[i], where dp[i] is the number of ways to form i by adding elements from the array.
dp[i] = dp[i-1] + sum(1 if k <= N-i else 0 for k in array) for i in range(1, N+1)]
Use a dictionary or hash map to store the intermediate results of the dynamic programming computation.
