'Optimal' refers to whether we're trying to find the maximum value or the minimum effort required to solve this problem.
dp[i-1][j+1] = 1 if S[i-1..j+1] is a palindrome, and 0 otherwise
Whether the character at index i and j are the same; if yes, then we can extend the current palindrome
If you want to implement memoization by storing and reusing previously computed values of dp[i][j] to avoid redundant computations.
