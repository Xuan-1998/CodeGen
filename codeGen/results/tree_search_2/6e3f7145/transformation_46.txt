Explore a hybrid approach that combines both top-down and bottom-up techniques to efficiently solve this problem
Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = 1 if S[i...j] is a palindrome, otherwise 0, and the base case as dp[i][i] = 1 for all i.
Explore using a boolean flag 'is_palindrome' to determine if S[i...j] is a palindrome, and transition between states by checking if the characters at indices i-1 and j+1 are equal.
Use dynamic programming to find the longest palindromic substring by maintaining a 2D array of size (len(S), len(S)) and initializing each cell with False. Then, iterate through the string from left to right and update the dp table accordingly.
