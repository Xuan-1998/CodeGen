Choosing a dynamic programming approach that involves building upon previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems.

The longest palindromic substring of S can be obtained by considering the set of all substrings in S, with each substring being a potential palindrome.
Use a dictionary to store previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems and look up their values as needed.
