Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = 1 if S[i] == S[j] and j - i < k for some k, and the base case as dp[i][i] = 1 for all i.
Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = 1 if S[i..j] is a palindrome, considering the base case dp[i][i] = 1 for all i.
Implement memoization by creating a dictionary dp where dp[(i, j)] = 1 if S[i..j] is a palindrome, and use this dictionary to store and retrieve previously computed values.
