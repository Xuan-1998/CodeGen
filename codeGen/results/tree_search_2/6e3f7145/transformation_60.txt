'Optimal' refers to whether we're trying to find the maximum value or the minimum effort required to solve this problem.
dp[i][j] = 1 if S[i..j] is a palindrome, and 0 otherwise
for each i in range(len(S)), dp[i][i] = 1, because a single character is always a palindrome
Create a 2D array dp of size (len(S) x len(S)) and initialize it with all zeros. Then, iterate over the array from top to bottom and left to right, and update each cell dp[i][j] based on whether S[i..j] is a palindrome or not.
