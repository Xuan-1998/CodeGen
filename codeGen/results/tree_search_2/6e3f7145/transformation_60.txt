Explore a hybrid approach that combines both top-down and bottom-up techniques to efficiently solve this problem
Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = 1 if S[i...j] is a palindrome, and the base case as dp[i][i-1] = 0 for all i.
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j+1] and S[i] == S[j], by extending the palindrome from both ends towards the center.
Expand around the center to generate palindromes, then use dynamic programming to keep track of the longest palindromic substring seen so far.
