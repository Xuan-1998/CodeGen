'Optimal' refers to whether we're trying to find the maximum value or the minimum effort required to solve this problem.
dp[i-1][j+1] = 1 if S[i-1..j+1] is a palindrome, and 0 otherwise
Whether the current character in the string matches the character at the corresponding position from the end; if yes, then there's a possibility of extending the palindrome
Use a bottom-up approach by iteratively filling up the 2D table in a top-left to bottom-right manner.
