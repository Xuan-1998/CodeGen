Consider a top-down recursive approach with memoization to identify the longest palindromic substring by checking if substrings are palindromes, and store the results in a dictionary.
'The first character of the current palindrome': Define state as the first character of the current palindrome being checked, and check if it's equal to the last character of the current palindrome.
State: (s, e) where s is the starting index and e is the ending index of the current palindrome, Transition: update state by incrementing/decrementing s/e depending on whether the character at s/e is equal to the middle character.
Implement dynamic programming using a bottom-up approach by filling up the 2D table row by row, starting from the base case where the length of the longest palindromic substring ending at index i is 1 when the character at index i is the same as itself.
