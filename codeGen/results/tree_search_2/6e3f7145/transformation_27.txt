Choosing a dynamic programming approach that involves building upon previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems.

The palindromic substring ending at each position in the string, with the length of this palindrome being 1 if the character at that position is equal to itself (i.e., it's a single character), and the maximum length of palindrome seen so far for characters on its left.
Dynamic programming by building up from smaller subproblems by computing the longest palindromic substring ending at each position in the string.
