'Optimal' refers to whether we're trying to find the maximum value or the minimum effort required to solve this problem.
dp[i][j] = 1 if S[i..j] is a palindrome, and 0 otherwise
dp[i][j] represents whether the substring S[i..j] is a palindrome.
Storing only the minimum/maximum value required for each state in the dynamic programming table.
