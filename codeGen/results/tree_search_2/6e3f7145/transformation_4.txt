Consider a top-down recursive approach with memoization to identify the longest palindromic substring by checking if substrings are palindromes, and store the results in a dictionary.
'The first character of the current palindrome': Define state as the first character of the current palindrome being checked, and check if it's equal to the last character of the current palindrome.
State: (s, e) where s is the starting index and e is the ending index of the current palindrome, Transition: update state by incrementing/decrementing s/e depending on whether the character at s/e is equal to the middle character.
Use memoization to store the results of subproblems in a dictionary, with keys being tuples of (s, e) representing the start and end indices of the current palindrome, and values being boolean indicating whether the substring is palindromic or not.
