Choosing a dynamic programming approach that involves building upon previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems.
\
Think about building up from shorter palindromes to longer ones by considering centered and non-centered substrings.
Employ a dynamic programming approach where you iterate over the string, considering centered and non-centered substrings, and use a set to keep track of previously computed longest palindromes.
