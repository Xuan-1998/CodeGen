Consider a top-down recursive approach with memoization to identify the longest palindromic substring by checking if substrings are palindromes, and store the results in a dictionary.
'A subset of S': Define state as a set of characters within string S that is being considered for palindromic substring, and check if it's equal to its reverse.
Use a sliding window approach with two pointers, one at the start and one at the end, to check for palindromes and update the maximum length accordingly
Avoid using memoization altogether and instead use a 1D table to store the lengths of the longest palindromic suffix for each character in the string.
