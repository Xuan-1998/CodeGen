Choosing a dynamic programming approach that involves building upon previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems.
\
Maintain two pointers, one at the start and another at the end of a potential palindrome, and move them inwards as long as the characters at both ends are equal.
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to fill in a 2D table, where each cell represents whether a given substring is a palindrome
