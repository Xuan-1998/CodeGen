Choosing a dynamic programming approach that involves building upon previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems.

The state represents the longest palindromic substring ending at the current position, and the transition relationships involve extending or updating this state as we move towards the left.
Implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach using a table to store the lengths of palindromic substrings.
