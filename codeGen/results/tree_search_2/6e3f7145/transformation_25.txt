Choosing a dynamic programming approach that involves building upon previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems.
\
'Palindromic' implies we need to consider both forward and backward strings at each step. This might involve maintaining two pointers or indices.
Maintain a single pointer moving forward and backward from the center of the potential palindrome, updating the memoization table as needed.
