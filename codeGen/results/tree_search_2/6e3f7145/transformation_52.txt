Explore a hybrid approach that combines both top-down and bottom-up techniques to efficiently solve this problem
Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = 1 if S[i] == S[j] and j - i < k for some k, and the base case as dp[i][i] = 1 for all i.
Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = 1 if S[i..j] is a palindrome, considering the base case dp[i][i] = 1 for all i.
Use top-down dynamic programming with memoization by defining a recursive function that checks if S[i..j] is a palindrome, and storing the results in a dictionary to avoid redundant computations.
