Explore a hybrid approach that combines both top-down and bottom-up techniques to efficiently solve this problem
Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = 1 if S[i] == S[j] and j - i < k for some k, and the base case as dp[i][i] = 1 for all i.
Formulate state and transition relationships by using a boolean array to keep track of whether each substring is a palindrome or not.
Employ memoization using a dictionary to store and reuse computed values
