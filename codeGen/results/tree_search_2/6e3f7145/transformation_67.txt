'Optimal' refers to whether we're trying to find the maximum value or the minimum effort required to solve this problem.
dp[i-1][j+1] = 1 if S[i-1..j+1] is a palindrome, and 0 otherwise
Whether the substring S[i..j] is equal to its reverse; if yes, then it's a palindrome
Use a hash table to store the longest palindromic substrings found so far and their corresponding indices, then look up these substrings when checking for palindromes.
