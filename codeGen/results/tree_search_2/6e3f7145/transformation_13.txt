Consider a top-down recursive approach with memoization to identify the longest palindromic substring by checking if substrings are palindromes, and store the results in a dictionary.
'The length of the current palindrome': Define state as the length of the current palindrome being checked, and check if it's equal to its reverse.
Think of the state as the length of the current palindrome being checked, and define a transition function that checks if the substring centered at the current position is a palindrome. Use memoization to store the results and avoid redundant calculations.
Use dynamic programming to build up solutions from smaller problems.
