Explore a hybrid approach that combines both top-down and bottom-up techniques to efficiently solve this problem
Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = 1 if S[i...j] is a palindrome, and the base case as dp[i][i-1] = 0 for all i.
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j+1] and S[i] == S[j], by extending the palindrome from both ends towards the center.
Use a bottom-up approach to build up the palindrome table by comparing substrings and checking for palindromes.
