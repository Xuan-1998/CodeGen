'Optimal' refers to whether we're trying to find the maximum value or the minimum effort required to solve this problem.
dp[i][j] = 1 if S[i..j] is a palindrome, and 0 otherwise
for each i in range(len(S)), dp[i][i] = 1, because a single character is always a palindrome
Instead of creating a 2D array, create a 1D array dp of size (len(S)) and use it as a lookup table. Initialize dp with all zeros, then iterate over the string from left to right, updating each cell dp[i] based on whether S[i..i+1] is a palindrome or not.
