'Optimal' refers to whether we're trying to find the maximum value or the minimum effort required to solve this problem.
dp[i-1][i+1] = 1 if S[i-1..i+1] is a palindrome, and 0 otherwise
dp[i-1][i+1] = 1 if S[i-1..i+1] is a palindrome, and 0 otherwise
Use a hash map to store the substrings that have been checked if they are palindromes, and check the existence of a substring in O(1) time.
