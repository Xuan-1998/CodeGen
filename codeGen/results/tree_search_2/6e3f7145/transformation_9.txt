Consider a top-down recursive approach with memoization to identify the longest palindromic substring by checking if substrings are palindromes, and store the results in a dictionary.
'The length of the current palindrome': Define state as the length of the current palindrome being checked, and check if it's equal to its reverse.
Consider a dynamic programming approach where the state is the current character position in the string, and the transition relationship is whether the substring from the current position to the end is a palindrome or not.
Use dictionary-based memoization to store and look up previously computed palindromes
