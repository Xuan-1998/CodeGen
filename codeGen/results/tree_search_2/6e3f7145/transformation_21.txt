Choosing a dynamic programming approach that involves building upon previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems.
\
Think about building up from shorter palindromes to longer ones by considering centered and non-centered substrings.
Use a 2D table where each cell [i][j] represents the length of the longest palindromic substring ending at index j and including indices i to j.
