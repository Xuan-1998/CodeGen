Choosing a dynamic programming approach that involves building upon previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems.

The longest palindromic substring of S can be obtained by considering the set of all substrings in S, with each substring being a potential palindrome.
Use a list of boolean arrays, with each array representing the palindrome status of all substrings at a given length.
