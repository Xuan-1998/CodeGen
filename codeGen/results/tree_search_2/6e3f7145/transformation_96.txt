What if we already know some palindromes, and we can use those as building blocks? What would be an 'optimal' choice in that case?
 Define the state expression and base case as follows: Let dp[i][j] be true if the substring S[i..j] is a palindrome, and let the base case be that single-character substrings are always palindromes.
Consider dp[i][j] as true if S[i..j] is a palindrome, with the base case being single-character substrings.
Maintain a set of all palindromes and check if any palindrome is a prefix of another
