'Optimal' refers to whether we're trying to find the maximum value or the minimum effort required to solve this problem.
dp[i-1][i+1] = 1 if S[i-1..i+1] is a palindrome, and 0 otherwise
dp[i-1][i+1] = 1 if S[i-1..i+1] is a palindrome, and 0 otherwise
Create a 2D table dp of size (len(S) x len(S)) to store whether S[i-j] is a palindrome for each j from 0 to len(S).
