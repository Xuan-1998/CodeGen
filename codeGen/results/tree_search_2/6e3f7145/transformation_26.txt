Choosing a dynamic programming approach that involves building upon previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems.
\
'Palindromic' implies we need to consider both forward and backward strings at each step. This might involve maintaining two pointers or indices.
Store the longest palindromic substring found so far in a separate variable, and update it whenever a longer one is discovered.
