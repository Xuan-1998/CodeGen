'Optimal' refers to whether we're trying to find the maximum value or the minimum effort required to solve this problem.
dp[i-1][j+1] = 1 if S[i-1..j+1] is a palindrome, and 0 otherwise
Whether the character at index i and j are the same; if yes, then we can extend the current palindrome
If you want to implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach using a 2D array, where each cell dp[i-1][j+1] represents whether the substring from i-1 to j+1 is a palindrome or not.
