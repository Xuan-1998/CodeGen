Consider a top-down recursive approach with memoization to identify the longest palindromic substring by checking if substrings are palindromes, and store the results in a dictionary.
'A subset of S': Define state as a set of characters within string S that is being considered for palindromic substring, and check if it's equal to its reverse.
Use a sliding window approach with two pointers, one at the start and one at the end, to check for palindromes and update the maximum length accordingly
Implement memoization by using a dictionary to store the results of checking if substrings are palindromes, and update the longest palindromic substring accordingly.
