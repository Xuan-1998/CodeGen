Choosing a dynamic programming approach that involves building upon previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems.

The palindromic substring ending at each position in the string, with the length of this palindrome being 1 if the character at that position is equal to itself (i.e., it's a single character), and the maximum length of palindrome seen so far for characters on its left.
Memoizing the lengths of palindromic substrings to avoid redundant computation and speed up the solution.
