'Optimal' refers to whether we're trying to find the maximum value or the minimum effort required to solve this problem.
dp[i-1][i+1] = 1 if S[i-1..i+1] is a palindrome, and 0 otherwise
Check if the characters at both ends of the substring are equal and the substring in between is a palindrome.
If two substrings are the same when reversed, consider them as one single 'palindromic unit' for memoization.
