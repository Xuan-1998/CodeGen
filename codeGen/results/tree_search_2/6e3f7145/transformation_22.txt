Choosing a dynamic programming approach that involves building upon previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems.
\
Think about building up from shorter palindromes to longer ones by considering centered and non-centered substrings.
Create a memoization dictionary that maps tuples of (start, end) indices to the longest palindromic substring ending at those indices.
