"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S. A substring of string S is defined as S[i...j] where 0 \\u2264 i \\u2264 j < len(S). A palindrome string is a string that reads the same backward. More formally, S is a palindrome if reverse(S) = S. In case of conflict, return the substring which occurs first (with the least starting index).\\n\\nInput: The input is a single string S, received from standard input. \\n\\nOutput: The output is a single string, which is the longest palindromic substring of S.\\n\\nConstraints: The input string S has a length between 1 and 1000.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['String algorithms', 'Dynamic programming', 'Data structures']\", \"difficulties\": \"MEDIUM\", \"source\": \"geeksforgeeks\", \"url\": \"https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-palindrome-in-a-string3411/1\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"S = \\\"aaaabbaa\\\"\", \"output\": \"aabbaa\"}, {\"input\": \"S = \\\"abc\\\"\", \"output\": \"a\"}]}"
