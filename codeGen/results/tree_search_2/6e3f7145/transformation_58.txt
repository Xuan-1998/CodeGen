'Optimal' refers to whether we're trying to find the maximum value or the minimum effort required to solve this problem.
dp[i][j] = 1 if S[i..j] is a palindrome, and 0 otherwise
dp[i-1][j+1] = 1 if S[i..i+1] and S[j..j-1] are palindromes, else 0
Store the length of the longest palindromic substring in a variable and update it accordingly as you fill up the table.
