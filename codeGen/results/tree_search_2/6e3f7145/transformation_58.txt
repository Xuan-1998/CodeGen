Explore a hybrid approach that combines both top-down and bottom-up techniques to efficiently solve this problem
Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = 1 if S[i] == S[j] and j - i < k for some k, and the base case as dp[i][i] = 1 for all i.
Consider using a two-pointer approach to find the longest palindromic substring. Initialize two pointers at the start and end of the string, then move them towards the center if the characters at their positions are equal.
Use a recursive approach with memoization
