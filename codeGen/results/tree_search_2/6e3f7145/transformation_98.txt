What if we already know some palindromes, and we can use those as building blocks? What would be an 'optimal' choice in that case?
 Define the state expression and base case as follows: Let dp[i][j] be true if the substring S[i..j] is a palindrome, and let the base case be that single-character substrings are always palindromes.
Think of dp[i][j] as 1 if S[i-1..j+1] is a palindrome and S[i] == S[j], with the base case being single-character substrings.
You can use dynamic programming to store whether each substring is a palindrome or not, then check all substrings for palindromes.
