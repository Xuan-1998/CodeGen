Choosing a dynamic programming approach that involves building upon previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems.

The state represents the longest palindromic substring ending at the current position, and the transition relationships involve extending or updating this state as we move towards the left.
Apply top-down dynamic programming with memorization using recursion with memoization.
