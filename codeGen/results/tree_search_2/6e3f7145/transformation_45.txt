Choosing a dynamic programming approach that involves building upon previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems.

The longest palindromic substring of S can be obtained by considering the set of all substrings in S, with each substring being a potential palindrome.
Create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring S[i...j] is palindromic.
