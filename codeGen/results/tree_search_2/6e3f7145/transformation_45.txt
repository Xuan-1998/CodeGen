Explore a hybrid approach that combines both top-down and bottom-up techniques to efficiently solve this problem
Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = 1 if S[i...j] is a palindrome, otherwise 0, and the base case as dp[i][i] = 1 for all i.
Explore using a boolean flag 'is_palindrome' to determine if S[i...j] is a palindrome, and transition between states by checking if the characters at indices i-1 and j+1 are equal.
Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents whether S[i...j] is a palindrome, and use nested loops to fill in the table based on the problem constraints.
