'Optimal' refers to whether we're trying to find the maximum value or the minimum effort required to solve this problem.
dp[i][j] = 1 if S[i..j] is a palindrome, and 0 otherwise
dp[i][j] represents whether the substring S[i..j] is a palindrome.
Using a single array to store the dynamic programming table where dp[i] represents whether the substring S[0..i] is a palindrome.
