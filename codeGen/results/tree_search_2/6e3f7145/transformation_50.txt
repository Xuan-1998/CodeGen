Choosing a dynamic programming approach that involves building upon previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems.

The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach where we maintain a table that keeps track of the length of the longest palindromic substring for each prefix of the input string.
Employ a hybrid approach by combining both tabulation and memoization to efficiently solve the problem.
