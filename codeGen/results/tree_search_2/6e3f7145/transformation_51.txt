Choosing a dynamic programming approach that involves building upon previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems.

A state variable representing whether a given substring is a palindrome or not and transition relationships based on whether the first and last characters are equal.
Dynamic programming by creating a 2D array where each cell represents the palindromic status of a substring.
