Explore a hybrid approach that combines both top-down and bottom-up techniques to efficiently solve this problem
Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = 1 if S[i...j] is a palindrome, otherwise 0, and the base case as dp[i][i] = 1 for all i.
Define dp[i][j] as 1 if S[i...j] is a palindrome, otherwise 0, based on whether the characters at indices i-1 and j+1 are equal, and use this state to determine whether S[i...j] is a palindrome
Apply memoization by using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems, where each key is a tuple representing the start and end indices of the substring.
