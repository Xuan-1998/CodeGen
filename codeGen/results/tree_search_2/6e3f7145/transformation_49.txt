Choosing a dynamic programming approach that involves building upon previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems.

The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach where we maintain a table that keeps track of the length of the longest palindromic substring for each prefix of the input string.
Utilize memoization by maintaining a dictionary that stores the longest palindromic substring for each prefix of the input string.
