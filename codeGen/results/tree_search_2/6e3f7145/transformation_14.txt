Choosing a dynamic programming approach that involves building upon previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems.

The state represents whether the substring centered at this position and having an odd length is palindromic, and the transition relationships are based on checking the palindrome property of this substring.
Build a Trie data structure to store and efficiently check whether a substring is palindromic
