Consider a top-down recursive approach with memoization to identify the longest palindromic substring by checking if substrings are palindromes, and store the results in a dictionary.
'The first character of the current palindrome': Define state as the first character of the current palindrome being checked, and check if it's equal to the last character of the current palindrome.
Define state as a tuple (s, c) where s is the starting index and c is the last character of the current palindrome. Check if c is equal to the character at indices s and e, then update state accordingly.
Differentiate between odd-length and even-length palindromes while filling up the table.
