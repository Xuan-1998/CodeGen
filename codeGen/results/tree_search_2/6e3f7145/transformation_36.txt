Choosing a dynamic programming approach that involves building upon previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems.
\
Expand the problem into smaller subproblems by considering all possible substrings of S.
Use a 2D table to store the dynamic programming state, where each cell [i][j] represents whether S[i...j] is a palindrome.
