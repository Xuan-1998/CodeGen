'Optimal' refers to whether we're trying to find the maximum value or the minimum effort required to solve this problem.
dp[i-1][i+1] = 1 if S[i-1..i+1] is a palindrome, and 0 otherwise
Consider each character in the string as the center of the palindrome. Calculate whether there's an odd-length or even-length palindrome centered at this character.
Maintain a set of all palindromic substrings found so far, and check each new substring to see if it's already in the set.
