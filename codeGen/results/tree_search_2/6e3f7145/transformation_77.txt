'Optimal' refers to whether we're trying to find the maximum value or the minimum effort required to solve this problem.
dp[i-1][i+1] = 1 if S[i-1..i+1] is a palindrome, and 0 otherwise
dp[i-1][i+1] = 1 if S[i-1..i+1] is a palindrome, and 0 otherwise
Create a variable max_len = 0 and a variable start = 0; then for each i from 0 to len(S), iterate through j from i to len(S), and update max_len and start accordingly.
