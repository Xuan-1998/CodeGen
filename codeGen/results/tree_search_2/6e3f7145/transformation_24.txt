Choosing a dynamic programming approach that involves building upon previously computed solutions for smaller subproblems.
\
'Palindromic' implies we need to consider both forward and backward strings at each step. This might involve maintaining two pointers or indices.
Use a 2D table to store the longest palindromic substrings for all possible prefixes and suffixes of the input string.
