Explore a hybrid approach that combines both top-down and bottom-up techniques to efficiently solve this problem
Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = 1 if S[i...j] is a palindrome, otherwise 0, and the base case as dp[i][i] = 1 for all i.
Consider defining the state expression as dp[i][j] = 1 if S[i...j] is a palindrome, otherwise 0, based on whether the characters at indices i and j are equal.
Consider using memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computation.
