Your plan is a good start, but it doesn't consider the fact that the program can jump around in the sequence and might not necessarily progress linearly from 2 to n. Because of this, a dynamic programming approach might not be the best solution here. 

Instead, we could use a depth-first search (DFS) to simulate the program's operations. If we encounter a number we've already visited during our DFS, we know that the program will never terminate and we can output -1. If we reach a number outside the range [1, n], we know the program has terminated and we can output the value of y. 

Here is the updated plan:

1. For each i from 1 to n, simulate the program's operations using a depth-first search. 

2. Initialize x = i and y = 0. 

3. While x is within the range [1, n], perform the following operations:
    - If we've already visited x during this DFS, output -1 and break out of the loop.
    - Otherwise, mark x as visited.
    - Increase y by a_{x}.
    - Increase x by a_{x}.
    - Decrease x by a_{x}.

4. If x is not within the range [1, n], output the value of y.

This approach should correctly simulate the program's operations for each starting position in the sequence.
