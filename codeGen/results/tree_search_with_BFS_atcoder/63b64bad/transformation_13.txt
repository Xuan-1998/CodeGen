The plan seems to be on the right track, but there are some corrections and additions needed to make it work correctly. Here's the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Bottom-Up Strategy with Tabulation: This approach starts from the simplest subproblem and gradually builds up to the solution of the original problem, storing the results of each subproblem in a table. This strategy avoids the risk of stack overflow and can sometimes be more efficient, but it can be more difficult to formulate the problem in this way.
The state expression can be defined as dp[i] which represents the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}.

2. Transition Function: If x <= 0 or x > n, the program terminates and dp[i] = y. Otherwise, dp[i] = dp[i + a_{x}] if i + a_{x} <= n, and dp[i] = -1 if i + a_{x} > n. However, this approach may lead to an infinite loop if the sequence keeps on cycling. To avoid this, we need to keep track of the visited states. If a state is visited again, it means the program does not terminate and we should return -1.

3. Memoization: Initialize a memo array dp[n+1] to store the final value of y for each sequence. Define a recursive function solve(i) that returns dp[i] if it's already calculated, otherwise it calculates dp[i] by the transition function and returns it. Call solve(1) to start the program.

4. Initialize an array visited[n+1] to keep track of the visited states. If a state is visited again, return -1.

5. For each i from 1 to n, call solve(i) and print the result.

6. Edge cases: If n = 2, the program will terminate immediately because x = 1 and a_{1} is not defined. Therefore, the result is 0 for all i.
