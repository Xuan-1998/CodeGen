Your plan to use Dynamic Programming seems correct and it should work for this problem. However, it lacks the details on how to implement the operations that the program performs on the sequence. You also need to define how to handle the termination condition. Here is an updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-Down Approach with Memoization: This approach starts from the original problem and breaks it down into subproblems, storing the results of each subproblem to avoid redundant computations in the future. This strategy is generally easier to implement and understand, but may lead to stack overflow for very large inputs due to recursion.
State Expression: Let dp[i] be the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. If the program does not terminate, dp[i] = -1.
2. State: dp[i] is the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. If the program does not terminate, dp[i] = -1.
3. Initialize an array dp of size n+1, and an array visited of size n+1, both filled with 0. dp[i] will store the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. visited[i] will indicate whether the program has visited index i before.
4. For i from 1 to n, if dp[i] is not calculated (dp[i] == 0 and visited[i] == 0), call a recursive function solve(i) that simulates the program's operations on the sequence and calculates dp[i]. The function should perform the following steps:
    a. Mark visited[i] as true.
    b. If i <= 0 or i > n, return 0 (the program terminates).
    c. If visited[i] is true and dp[i] == 0 (a cycle is detected), return -1 (the program does not terminate).
    d. Calculate dp[i] = a[i] + solve(i + a[i]) if i + a[i] <= n, or dp[i] = a[i] + solve(i - a[i]) if i + a[i] > n.
5. Print dp[i] for i from 1 to n.
