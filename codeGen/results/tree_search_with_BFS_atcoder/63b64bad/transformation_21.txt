Your intuition is correct that this problem could be solved by using dynamic programming. However, the plan you provided is not completely correct. 

The main issue with the plan is that it doesn't handle the case where the program doesn't terminate. In this case, there would be a cycle in the program, and we need a way to detect this. 

Here is an updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize three arrays: `dp`, `visited`, and `in_cycle` of size `n+1`. The array `dp` will store the final value of y for each i. The array `visited` will store whether we have visited a certain i. The array `in_cycle` will store whether a certain i is in a cycle.
2. For each i from 1 to n, if it's not visited, perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from i. In the DFS:
   1. Mark i as visited.
   2. If i <= 0 or i > n, return 0 (base case).
   3. If i is already in the DFS call stack, mark it as in a cycle and return -1.
   4. Call DFS on i+a[i] and i-a[i]. If either returns -1, mark i as in a cycle and return -1.
   5. If i is not in a cycle, dp[i] = a[i] + max(dp[i+a[i]], dp[i-a[i]])
3. For each i from 1 to n, print dp[i]. If i is in a cycle, print -1.
===END PLAN===

This plan correctly handles the case where the program doesn't terminate by detecting cycles. It uses a DFS approach to traverse the sequence and compute the final value of y for each i. The time complexity is O(n) as each i is visited at most once. The space complexity is also O(n) for storing the arrays.
