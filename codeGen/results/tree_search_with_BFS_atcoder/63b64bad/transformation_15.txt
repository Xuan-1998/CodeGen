Your plan seems to be a good starting point for this problem. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed.

First, your memoization step is not completely correct. The program does not always increase x and y by a_{x}. It first increases both x and y by a_{x}, and then increases y by a_{x} while decreasing x by a_{x}. This means that the value of x can decrease and become less than i. Therefore, you cannot simply use dp[i] = dp[i-1] + a[i].

Second, the program may not terminate, which means that you cannot simply set dp[i] = -1 when i-1 + a[i] > n. Instead, you need to detect cycles in the sequence of operations. If a cycle is detected, the program will never terminate and you should output -1.

Here's an updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Bottom-Up Strategy with Tabulation: This approach starts from the simplest subproblem and gradually builds up to the solution of the original problem, storing the results of each subproblem in a table. This strategy avoids the risk of stack overflow and can sometimes be more efficient, but it can be more difficult to formulate the problem in this way.
The state expression can be defined as dp[i] which represents the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}.
2. Initialization: dp[1] = 0, as the initial value of y is 0.
3. Memoization: Create an array dp with length n+1 and initialize dp[1] = 0. Then, define a recursive function that takes i as an argument and returns dp[i] if it's already calculated. If not calculated, it performs the operations defined in the problem statement. If it encounters an index that it has visited before (which indicates a cycle), it sets dp[i] = -1 and returns -1. If it reaches an index outside the range of the sequence, it returns the current value of y.
4. Finally, return the dp array.
===END PLAN===
