Your plan seems to be on the right track. It is indeed a dynamic programming problem. However, there are a few details that need to be addressed:

1. The sequence we are given starts from a_2, not a_1. Therefore, x is initially 1 and is incremented by a_{x+1} (not a_{x}) since the sequence starts from a_2.

2. The base case will be when x <= 0 or x > n, as the problem states the program terminates in these cases. If x <= 0, we can return y. If x > n, the program does not terminate, so we can return -1.

3. We need to handle the case where the program enters a loop and never terminates. We can keep track of the states we have visited and if we visit a state we have seen before, we can conclude that the program will not terminate and return -1.

Here's the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize an array dp of size n+1 with all values set to -2. This will be used for memoization. dp[i] represents the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. -2 signifies that we have not computed the value for this state yet.

2. Create a helper function that takes x and y as input and returns the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence x, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. The function first checks if x <= 0 or x > n. If x <= 0, it returns y. If x > n, it returns -1. If dp[x] is not equal to -2 (i.e., has been computed before), it returns dp[x].

3. If none of the above conditions are met, it means we are visiting this state for the first time. We can then set dp[x] to -1 to indicate that we are currently computing the value for this state. If we encounter this state again before we have finished computing its value, it means we are in a loop and the program will not terminate, so we can return -1.

4. The function then calls itself with x and y incremented by a_{x+1} and stores the result in dp[x] before returning it.

5. The main function calls this helper function for each i from 2 to n and prints the returned value.
===END PLAN===
