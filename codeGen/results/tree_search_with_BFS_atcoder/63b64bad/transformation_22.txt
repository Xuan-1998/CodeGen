Your plan is a good starting point, but it has some flaws. The main issue is that you did not consider that the value of y changes after each operation. Therefore, you cannot use a simple visited array to check if you have visited an index before. Also, you did not consider the case when x becomes greater than n or less than or equal to 0. 

Here is the updated plan:

1. State: The state dp[i] represents the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. Initialize an array dp of size n+1 with -1.

2. Visited: Maintain an array visited of size n+1 to keep track of the indices that have been visited during the current iteration. Initialize it with false.

3. Base Case: dp[1] = 0, as initially y = 0.

4. Iteration: For each i from 2 to n, perform the following steps:
    a. Initialize x = i and y = 0.
    b. While x > 0 and x <= n, perform the following steps:
        i. If visited[x] is true, then the program does not terminate for this i. Break the loop and continue to the next i.
        ii. Set visited[x] to true.
        iii. Increase y by a[x].
        iv. Increase x by a[x].
        v. If x > 0 and x <= n, increase y by a[x] and decrease x by a[x].
    c. If the loop terminated because x <= 0 or x > n, then the program terminates for this i. Set dp[i] to y.

5. Output: For each i from 2 to n, print dp[i]. If dp[i] is -1, print -1.

This plan handles the case when the program does not terminate by checking if an index has been visited during the current iteration. It also correctly updates the value of y after each operation and checks if x becomes greater than n or less than or equal to 0.
