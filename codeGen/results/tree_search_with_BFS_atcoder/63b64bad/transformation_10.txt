Your plan looks good and it seems like a viable solution to the problem. However, there are a few points that need to be addressed:

1. You haven't clearly defined how you will simulate the program on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n} and store the final value of y in dp[i]. You need to describe this process in more detail.

2. The problem statement mentions that if the program does not terminate, we should output -1. However, in your plan, you haven't described how you will handle this case. You need to check for an infinite loop in the program simulation and, if detected, set dp[i] to -1.

3. You need to consider the case where a_{x} = 0. In this case, x and y will not change, leading to an infinite loop.

Here's an updated plan considering these points:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State Definition: Let dp[i] be the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. If the program does not terminate, dp[i] = -1.

2. Initialize a dp array of size n with all elements as -1 and a visited array of size n with all elements as False. 

3. We iterate over the array from 2 to n. For each i, we first check if dp[i] is not -1, if it is not -1, then we already have the answer for this state, so we continue to the next state. If dp[i] is -1, then we simulate the program on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n} and store the final value of y in dp[i].

4. To simulate the program, we initialize x = 1 and y = 0. We then enter a while loop where we first increase x and y by a_{x}, then increase y by a_{x} and decrease x by a_{x}. We continue this process until x <= 0 or x > n. If x becomes less than or equal to 0 or more than n, we break the loop and store the final value of y in dp[i].

5. If during the program simulation, we encounter an index that we have visited before (checked by the visited array), we have detected an infinite loop. In this case, we break the loop and set dp[i] to -1.

6. Finally, we print the dp array from index 2 to n.
===END PLAN===
