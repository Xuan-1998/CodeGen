Your initial plan is a good starting point, but it seems like there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. The program does not increase and decrease `x` by `a_x` at the same time, but rather it first increases `x` and `y` by `a_x` then increases `y` while decreasing `x` by `a_x` in the next step. Also, the program terminates when `x` is less than or equal to 0 or greater than `n`, not when it enters a cycle.

Here is the updated plan:

1. Initialize two arrays `dp` and `visited`. `dp[i]` will store the final value of `y` when the program starts with `x=i`. `visited[i]` will indicate whether we have visited `i` before.

2. For each `i` from `n` to `1`, we simulate the program. If `visited[i]` is `True`, we skip this `i` because we have calculated `dp[i]` before.

3. During the simulation, if `x` becomes less than or equal to 0 or greater than `n`, we set `dp[i]` to `y` and break the loop. If we visit an `x` that has been visited before in this simulation, we set `dp[i]` to `-1` and break the loop.

4. For each `i` from `1` to `n`, we print `dp[i]`.

This plan will work because it simulates the program for each starting `x` and uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations. The time complexity is `O(n)` because we visit each `i` at most once. The space complexity is also `O(n)` because we need to store `dp` and `visited` for each `i`.
