Your plan seems to be on the right track, but there are a few points that need to be corrected or clarified:

1. The base case should not be dp[1] = 0, because the program starts from every position i (2 ≤ i ≤ n), not just from position 1. So, we need to initialize all dp[i] to -1, which means we haven't computed the result for this position yet.

2. The transition should be: if i + a[i] <= n and dp[i + a[i]] is not -1, then dp[i] = dp[i + a[i]] + a[i]; else if i - a[i] > 0 and dp[i - a[i]] is not -1, then dp[i] = dp[i - a[i]] + a[i]. This is because the program first increases both x and y by a_{x}, then increases y by a_{x} while decreasing x by a_{x}.

3. We need to handle the case where the program does not terminate. We can use a boolean array visited to mark the positions that we have visited. If we visit a position that we have visited before, then the program does not terminate and we should return -1.

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize an array dp of size n+1 with all elements as -1. This array will store the final value of y for each position i (2 ≤ i ≤ n). dp[i] = -1 means we haven't computed the result for this position yet.

2. Initialize a boolean array visited of size n+1 with all elements as false. This array will be used to mark the positions that we have visited. If we visit a position that we have visited before, then the program does not terminate and we should return -1.

3. For each position i (2 ≤ i ≤ n), use a recursive function to compute dp[i] if it is not computed yet. The recursive function should take the current position i and the sequence a as parameters, and return the final value of y for this position.

4. In the recursive function, first check if dp[i] is not -1. If it is not -1, then return dp[i]. If it is -1, then check if visited[i] is true. If it is true, then return -1 because the program does not terminate. If it is false, then mark visited[i] as true.

5. Then, compute the next position after increasing x by a_{x}: next = i + a[i]. If next <= n and dp[next] is not -1, then dp[i] = dp[next] + a[i]; else if next > n, then dp[i] = a[i] because the program terminates.

6. Compute the next position after increasing y by a_{x} and decreasing x by a_{x}: next = i - a[i]. If next > 0 and dp[next] is not -1, then dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[next] + a[i]); else if next <= 0, then dp[i] = max(dp[i], a[i]) because the program terminates.

7. Finally, return dp[i].

8. Print dp[i] for each position i (2 ≤ i ≤ n).
