Your plan seems to be on the right track in terms of using dynamic programming to solve this problem. However, the problem is more complex than it seems. The sequence can lead to a cycle where the program does not terminate. Therefore, we need to detect these cycles. We also need to keep track of the sum of the sequence up to the current point, not just the current value. 

Here is a refined version of your plan:

1. Initialize an array `dp` of size `n+1` with all elements as -1. This will store the final value of y for each sequence.

2. Initialize an array `visited` of size `n+1` with all elements as false. This will keep track of the nodes we have visited in the current run of the program.

3. Initialize an array `cycle` of size `n+1` with all elements as false. This will keep track of the nodes which are part of a cycle.

4. For every `i` from `1` to `n`, if `dp[i]` is not calculated yet, call a recursive function `solve(i)` to calculate `dp[i]`. The function `solve(i)` will simulate the program for the sequence starting from `i`.

5. In `solve(i)`, if `i` is not in the range `1` to `n`, return `0`. If `visited[i]` is true but `dp[i]` is -1, we have detected a cycle, so set `cycle[i]` to true and return `-1`. If `dp[i]` is not -1, return `dp[i]`.

6. Set `visited[i]` to true. Calculate `next = i + a[i]` and `y = solve(next)`. If `cycle[i]` is true or `y` is -1, set `cycle[i]` to true and `dp[i]` to -1. Otherwise, set `dp[i]` to `a[i] + y`.

7. After all `dp[i]` are calculated, print `dp[2]`, `dp[3]`, ..., `dp[n]`.

This plan ensures that we correctly handle cycles and calculate the final value of y for each sequence. It also ensures that we do not repeat the calculation for the same sequence.
