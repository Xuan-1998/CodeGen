Your plan has the right direction but it lacks some important details. It's true that we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem, but we also need to detect cycles in the sequence to determine if the program terminates or not.

Here's the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize an array `dp` of size `n+1` with all elements set to -1. This array will be used to store the final value of `y` for each run of the program. Also, initialize an array `visited` of size `n+1` with all elements set to `False`. This array will be used to track which elements of the sequence have been visited during each run of the program.

2. For each `i` from `1` to `n`, run the program on the sequence `i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}`. During each run of the program, use a while loop to repeat steps 2 and 3 of the program until it terminates. In each iteration of the while loop, first check if `x` is less than or equal to `0` or greater than `n`. If so, break the loop and set `dp[i]` to `y`. Then, check if `visited[x]` is `True`. If so, break the loop and leave `dp[i]` as `-1` (indicating that the program does not terminate). Otherwise, update `x` and `y` according to steps 2 and 3 of the program and set `visited[x]` to `True`.

3. After the while loop, if `dp[i]` is not `-1`, reset all elements of `visited` that were set to `True` during the run of the program to `False`. This is necessary because the `visited` array needs to be reset for each run of the program.

4. After completing the iteration for each `i`, output the elements of `dp` from `1` to `n`. Each element `dp[i]` represents the final value of `y` when the program is run on the sequence `i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}`, or `-1` if the program does not terminate.
===END PLAN===
