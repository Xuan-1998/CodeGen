Your plan is on the right track, but it seems to have some misunderstanding of the problem. The main issue is that the sequence is not static but is dynamically changing with each operation. 

Here's an updated plan:

1. Initialize two arrays, `dp` and `visited`, of size `n+1`. The `dp` array stores the final value of `y` and the `visited` array keeps track of which indices have been visited during the simulation. Initially, all elements in `dp` are -1 and all elements in `visited` are false.

2. For each index `i` from 1 to `n`, run a simulation if `dp[i]` is -1 (meaning it has not been computed yet).

3. In the simulation, start with `x = i` and `y = 0`. Repeat the following steps until the simulation terminates:

    a. If `x <= 0` or `x > n`, terminate the simulation. The final value of `y` is the current value of `y`. Store this value in `dp[i]`.

    b. If `visited[x]` is true, then we have entered a loop and the simulation will never terminate. In this case, set `dp[i]` to -1 and terminate the simulation.

    c. Otherwise, update `x` and `y` according to the rules in the problem statement, and mark `x` as visited.

4. Print the elements of `dp` from 1 to `n`.

This plan correctly simulates the operations on the sequence and properly handles the case where the simulation does not terminate. It also correctly uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant simulations.
