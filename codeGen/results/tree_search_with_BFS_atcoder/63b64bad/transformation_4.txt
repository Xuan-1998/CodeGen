Your plan seems to be on the right track, but there are some issues that need to be addressed. 

The main issue is that the plan does not handle the case where the program does not terminate. The program will not terminate if there is a cycle in the sequence. A cycle occurs when we revisit a previously visited index. If we encounter such a cycle, we should output -1 for the corresponding sequence. 

So, we need to modify the plan to handle this case. We can do this by keeping track of the visited indices and the indices currently in the stack of function calls (recursion stack). If we visit an index that is currently in the recursion stack, we know that we have encountered a cycle.

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-Down Approach with Memoization: This approach starts from the original problem and breaks it down into subproblems, storing the results of each subproblem to avoid redundant computations in the future. This strategy is generally easier to implement and understand, but may lead to stack overflow for very large inputs due to recursion.

2. State Expression: Let dp[i] be the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. If the program does not terminate, dp[i] = -1.

3. Transition: dp[i] = dp[i + a_{i}] if i + a_{i} is within the range [2, n], else dp[i] = a_{i}. If the program does not terminate, dp[i] = -1.

4. Tabulation: This approach involves creating a table of size n and filling it up in a bottom-up manner. Start by initializing all dp[i] to -1. Then, for each i from 2 to n, check if i + a_{i} is within the range [2, n]. If it is, set dp[i] = dp[i + a_{i}], else set dp[i] = a_{i].

5. Cycle Detection: Keep two boolean arrays, visited[] and inStack[]. Initialize them to False. When we visit an index i, set visited[i] to True and inStack[i] to True. When we finish processing an index i (i.e., we have computed dp[i]), set inStack[i] to False. If we visit an index i that is already in inStack[], then we have found a cycle and we should set dp[i] = -1.
