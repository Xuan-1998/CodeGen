Your plan seems correct and it covers the general idea of the problem. However, it's important to keep track of the nodes that are currently being visited in the recursion to detect a cycle. If a cycle is detected, it means the program will not terminate. Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===

1. Top-Down Approach with Memoization: This approach starts from the original problem and breaks it down into subproblems, storing the results of each subproblem to avoid redundant computations in the future. This strategy is generally easier to implement and understand, but may lead to stack overflow for very large inputs due to recursion.

2. State Expression: Let dp[i] be the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. If the program does not terminate, dp[i] = -1.

3. State Initialization: Initialize dp[i] = 0 for all valid i. This indicates that the state has not been computed yet. Also, initialize a visited array, visited[i] = 0 for all valid i, to keep track of the nodes that are currently being visited in the recursion.

4. State Transition: If visited[i] = 1, return -1 because a cycle is detected. If dp[i] is not 0, return dp[i]. Otherwise, mark visited[i] as 1 and compute dp[i] as a[i] + solve(i+a[i], a, dp, visited) if i+a[i] <= n, or a[i] if i+a[i] > n. Finally, mark visited[i] as 0 and return dp[i].
