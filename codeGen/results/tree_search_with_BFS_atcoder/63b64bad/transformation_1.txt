Your plan seems to be on the right track. Here's an updated version of the plan that includes more details about the recursive function and how to handle the termination conditions:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-Down Approach with Memoization: This approach starts from the original problem and breaks it down into subproblems, storing the results of each subproblem to avoid redundant computations in the future. This strategy is generally easier to implement and understand, but may lead to stack overflow for very large inputs due to recursion.
State Expression: Let dp[i] be the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. If the program does not terminate, dp[i] = -1.
2. State: dp[i] is the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. If the program does not terminate, dp[i] = -1.
3. Initialize an array visited of size n+1 to keep track of the nodes we have visited during the recursion. This is to detect if we are in a cycle (the program does not terminate).
4. For each i from 2 to n, call a recursive function solve(i, a, dp, visited) which will return the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}.
5. In the recursive function solve:
    - If visited[i] is true, return -1 because we are in a cycle.
    - If dp[i] is not -1, return dp[i] because we have computed the result before.
    - Set visited[i] to true.
    - Compute the new value of x and y according to the program's operations.
    - If the new value of x is not within the range [1, n], return the new value of y.
    - Otherwise, call solve with the new value of x, and add the returned value to the new value of y.
    - Store the result in dp[i] and return it.
