Your plan seems to be on the right track, but it's not complete. You've defined the state and base case well, but you haven't fully described how to transition between states and how to handle the termination condition. Here's an updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State: The state dp[i] represents the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}.
2. Base Case: dp[1] = 0, as initially y = 0.
3. Initialize an array dp of size n+1 with all elements as -1, and another array visited of size n+1 with all elements as False. dp[1] = 0 and visited[1] = True.
4. Start a loop from i=2 to n. For each i, simulate the program's operations starting from i, adding a_{x} to y and updating x as per the rules. If during this process, x becomes less than 1 or greater than n, update dp[i] with the current value of y and break the loop.
5. If x revisits a previously visited position, it means the program is in a loop and will never terminate. In this case, set dp[i] to -1 and break the loop.
6. After the loop, if dp[i] is still -1, it means the program did not terminate, so set dp[i] to -1.
7. Repeat steps 4 to 6 for all i from 2 to n.
8. The final array dp will contain the final value of y for each starting position i, or -1 if the program does not terminate from that position.
===END PLAN===
