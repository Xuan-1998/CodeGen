Your plan seems to be on the right track. However, you should also consider the case where x becomes greater than n. In such a case, the program also terminates. Also, note that the problem asks for the final value of y for each run of the program on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}, meaning we need to run the program starting from every position in the sequence. Therefore, we need to initialize our dp array with -2 (indicating unvisited state), and then update it with -1 if the program does not terminate from that position, or with the final value of y if it does. Here's the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize an array dp of size n+1 with -2 (indicating unvisited state).
2. For each position i in the sequence, use a recursive function solve(i) to determine the final value of y if the program starts from that position.
3. In the solve(i) function:
    - If i â‰¤ 0 or i > n, return 0 (the program terminates immediately).
    - If dp[i] is not -2, return dp[i] (the result of this subproblem has already been computed).
    - Set dp[i] to -1 (indicating that we are currently computing this subproblem).
    - Compute next = solve(i + a[i]) + a[i] (the next state if we increase both x and y by a_{x} and then decrease x by a_{x}).
    - If next is -1, return -1 (the program does not terminate).
    - Otherwise, update dp[i] with next and return next (the program terminates and the final value of y is next).
4. For each position i in the sequence, print dp[i].
===END PLAN===
