Your plan seems to be on the right track. However, it's a bit confusing when you mention a "bottom-up" approach in the beginning, but then describe a "top-down" approach (memoization). The approach you described is actually a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization, which is perfectly fine for this problem.

Here's the updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State Definition: Let dp[i] be the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. If the program does not terminate, dp[i] = -1.

2. Initialization: Create a dp array of size n+1 with all elements as -1, and a visited array of size n+1 with all elements as false. The reason for n+1 is to account for the 0-indexing of the array.

3. Recursive Function: Define a recursive function that takes i as an argument and returns the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. 

    a. In the function, first check if dp[i] is not -1. If it is not -1, then we already have the answer for this state, so return dp[i]. 

    b. If dp[i] is -1, then check if visited[i] is true. If it is true, then the program does not terminate, so return -1. 

    c. If visited[i] is false, then mark visited[i] as true, simulate the program on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}, store the final value of y in dp[i], and return dp[i].

4. Iteration: Iterate from 1 to n and call the recursive function for each i.

5. Output: Print the dp array from 1 to n. Each dp[i] represents the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. If the program does not terminate, dp[i] will be -1.

===END PLAN===

This plan should cover all the edge cases as well as the main problem. The main idea is to use dynamic programming with memoization to avoid recalculating the same states, and to detect cycles in the sequence that would cause the program to run indefinitely.
