Your plan seems to be on the right track. It's a good idea to use dynamic programming to solve this problem because of the overlapping subproblems. However, it seems like your plan is not completely clear on how you arrive at the solution for each subproblem and how you use the memoization to avoid repeated computation. Here's an updated version of the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. We use the top-down approach with memoization. We start from the original problem and break it down into subproblems. We store the results of each subproblem to avoid redundant computations in the future.

2. We define our state dp[i] to be the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. If the program does not terminate, dp[i] = -1.

3. We use an array, visited, of size n to track whether we've visited a state before. If visited[i] is 1 (which means the program has visited index i before), we return -1. Otherwise, we mark visited[i] as 1.

4. We define a recursive function solve(i, a, dp, visited) that calculates the value of dp[i]. This function first checks if i is out of bounds (i <= 0 or i > n), in which case it returns 0. If visited[i] is 1, it means we've encountered a loop, so we return -1. If dp[i] is not -1, it means we've already calculated the result for this state, so we return dp[i].

5. If none of the above conditions is met, we mark visited[i] as 1 and call solve(i + a[i], a, dp, visited) and solve(i - a[i], a, dp, visited). We store the maximum of these two values in dp[i] and return it.

6. We initialize dp with -1 and visited with 0. We call solve(i, a, dp, visited) for each i from 1 to n and print the result.
===END PLAN===
