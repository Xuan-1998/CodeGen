Your plan seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed. The main issue is that the program does not necessarily terminate if it reaches a state it has been in before, as it could be stuck in a loop. Therefore, we need to keep track of which states we have visited and whether we have confirmed that they terminate.

Here is an updated plan that should work:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define a list `dp` of size `n+1` to store the final value of `y` for each sequence. Initialize all values as -1, which represents that the sequence has not been visited yet.
2. Define a list `visited` of size `n+1` to keep track of the sequences that we have visited during the current run of the program. Initialize all values as False.
3. For each sequence `i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}`, do the following:
   1. Set `x` to `i` and `y` to 0.
   2. While `x` is within the bounds of the sequence and we have not visited `x` during the current run of the program, do the following:
      1. Mark `x` as visited.
      2. If `dp[x]` is not -1, then we have previously computed the final value of `y` for this sequence. Add `dp[x]` to `y` and break the loop.
      3. Otherwise, increase `y` by `a_{x}` and decrease `x` by `a_{x}`.
   3. If `x` is within the bounds of the sequence, then we are stuck in a loop and the program does not terminate. Set `dp[i]` to -1.
   4. Otherwise, the program terminates and `dp[i]` is the final value of `y`.
4. Print the values of `dp` from 2 to `n`.
===END PLAN===
