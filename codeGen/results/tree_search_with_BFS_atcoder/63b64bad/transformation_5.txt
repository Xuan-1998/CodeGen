The plan you've proposed seems to be on the right track. However, there's a minor mistake in the transition function. The sequence operates by first increasing both x and y by a_{x}, and then increasing y by a_{x} while decreasing x by a_{x}. So, the transition function should reflect this operation.

Here's the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-Down Approach with Memoization: This approach starts from the original problem and breaks it down into subproblems, storing the results of each subproblem to avoid redundant computations in the future. This strategy is generally easier to implement and understand, but may lead to stack overflow for very large inputs due to recursion.
State Expression: Let dp[i] be the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. If the program does not terminate, dp[i] = -1.
2. Transition: dp[i] = dp[i + a_{i}] + 2*a_{i} if i + a_{i} is within the range [2, n], else dp[i] = a_{i}. If the program does not terminate, dp[i] = -1.
3. Memoization: This approach involves creating a memo table of size n and filling it up in a top-down manner. Start by initializing all dp[i] to -1. Then, create a function that takes i as input and returns dp[i] if it's not -1. Otherwise, it computes dp[i] using the same logic as in the tabulation approach and stores the result in the memo table before returning it.
===END PLAN===

The plan seems to handle the problem well. It uses dynamic programming to avoid repeated computations and has a clear transition function. However, the plan needs to take care of the case where the program does not terminate. For this, we can use a visited array to keep track of the indices that have been visited. If we visit an index that has been visited before, we can conclude that the program will not terminate and return -1.
