Your plan seems to be on the right track. However, it seems to be missing a few key details. Here is an updated version of the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===

1. **State Expression:** The state expression can be defined as dp[i] which represents the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. We will also need a visited array to keep track of which values of i we have already visited.

2. **Tabulation Implementation:** Initialize a table dp of size n+1 with all values as -1. Also initialize a visited array of the same size with all values as false. We will use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to fill in the dp table. 

3. **DFS function:** The DFS function will take a current index and a current value of y. If the current index is less than 2 or greater than n, we return the current value of y. If we have already visited this index, we return -1. Otherwise, we mark this index as visited and recursively call the DFS function with the new index and new y value based on the rules of the program.

4. **Iterate over sequence:** Iterate over the sequence from 2 to n. For each i, if dp[i] is not -1, then the program terminates and dp[i] is the final value of y. Otherwise, run the DFS function on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n} and update dp[i] with the final value of y. 

5. **Final Answer:** The final answer is dp[i] for each i from 2 to n. If dp[i] is -1, it means the program does not terminate for this i.

===END PLAN===

This plan should cover all edge cases and is complete. It uses a DFS approach to simulate the program for each i and keeps track of visited indices to detect when the program does not terminate. The dp table stores the final value of y for each i, which can be printed out at the end.
