Your plan seems to be on the right track, but it needs more specificity in terms of how you will implement the operations of the program in your dynamic programming approach. Here's a more detailed version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Create two arrays, dp and vis, of size n+1. Initialize all elements of dp to -1 and all elements of vis to 0. The dp array will store the final value of y for each i, and the vis array will be used to keep track of which elements of the sequence have been visited during the execution of the program.

2. For each i from 1 to n, if dp[i] is -1, run the program on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n} to compute the final value of y. 

3. To run the program, start with x = i and y = 0. While x is within the range from 1 to n, perform the following steps:
   - If vis[x] is 1, this means the program has entered a cycle and will not terminate. In this case, return -1.
   - Otherwise, set vis[x] to 1.
   - Increase both x and y by a value equal to a_{x}.
   - Increase y by a_{x} while decreasing x by a_{x}.

4. If the program terminates, meaning x is not within the range from 1 to n, update dp[i] with the final value of y.

5. The final answer is the values of dp[i] for each i from 1 to n. Print these values in order.
===END PLAN===

This plan covers the operations of the program and how to implement them using dynamic programming. It also handles the case where the program does not terminate by checking for cycles in the sequence. However, it assumes that the sequence a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n} is given as input, which is not specified in the problem statement. You may need to adjust the plan based on the actual input format.
