Your plan of using dynamic programming to solve this problem is on the right track. However, we also need to keep track of whether we have visited a state before to determine if the program terminates or not. Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize a dp array of size n+1 to -1. The dp[i] will store the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. If dp[i] is -1, it means we have not calculated the final value of y for the sequence starting at i yet.

2. Initialize a visited array of size n+1 to False. The visited[i] will be True if we have visited the state i during the execution of the program. If we visit a state that we have visited before, it means the program does not terminate, and we should output -1.

3. Define a recursive function, say solve(i), that takes an integer i as input, and returns the final value of y when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. The function should do the following:
   - If i <= 0 or i > n, return 0.
   - If visited[i] is True, return -1.
   - If dp[i] is not -1, return dp[i].
   - Set visited[i] to True.
   - Calculate the new value of x and y.
   - Call solve(x) and add the return value to y.
   - If the return value is -1, set dp[i] to -1.
   - Otherwise, set dp[i] to y.
   - Set visited[i] to False.
   - Return dp[i].

4. Iterate over i from 1 to n. For each i, print the return value of solve(i).
===END PLAN===

This plan considers all possible states and transitions between them. It handles the case where the program does not terminate by checking if a state has been visited before. The use of memoization ensures that we do not calculate the final value of y for the same sequence more than once, which improves efficiency.
