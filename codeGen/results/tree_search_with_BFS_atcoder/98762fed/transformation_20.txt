Your plan seems to be on the right track, but it's missing some details. The main thing we need to consider is how to transition from a smaller subproblem to a larger one. In other words, we need to figure out how to calculate dp[i][j][k][l] based on the values of dp for smaller submatrices.

We can see that the condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} is equivalent to A_{a, b} \leq A_{a, d} and A_{c, b} \leq A_{c, d}. This means that for each column, the values must be non-decreasing as we go down, and for each row, the values must be non-increasing as we go right.

So, to calculate dp[i][j][k][l], we need to consider two cases: either the top-left cell of the submatrix (i, j) is 0 or 1. If it's 0, then all cells in the same row and column must also be 0. If it's 1, then all cells in the same row to the right and all cells in the same column below must also be 1. We can calculate the number of such matrices by multiplying the number of matrices for the remaining submatrices.

Here's the updated version of the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State Expression: dp[i][j][k][l] represents the number of matrices that satisfy the condition for the submatrix from (i, j) to (k, l).
2. Base Case: The base case would be dp[i][j][i][j] = 1 for all i and j, as a single cell always satisfies the condition.
3. Transition Function: Calculate dp[i][j][k][l] by considering two cases: either the top-left cell of the submatrix (i, j) is 0 or 1. If it's 0, then all cells in the same row and column must also be 0. If it's 1, then all cells in the same row to the right and all cells in the same column below must also be 1. Calculate the number of such matrices by multiplying the number of matrices for the remaining submatrices.
4. Calculate the number of matrices that satisfy the condition for each submatrix from smallest to largest using the bottom-up strategy.
===END PLAN===

This plan should work for all inputs within the given constraints. The time complexity is O(N^4), which is acceptable given that N and M are up to 400. The space complexity is also O(N^4), which should fit in memory.
