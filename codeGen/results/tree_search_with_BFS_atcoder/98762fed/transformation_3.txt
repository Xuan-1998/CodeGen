Your plan seems correct, but it needs a bit more detail and a slight correction. Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Dynamic Programming Approach: We will use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. This approach starts by solving the smallest subproblems and builds up to the original problem. The results of these subproblems are stored in a table for future reference to avoid repeated calculations.

2. State Expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid matrices with i rows and j columns. This state expression will be used to build up the solution to the problem.

3. Transition: The transition relationship is based on the principle of inclusion and exclusion, and the fact that any submatrix with i rows and j columns can be formed by adding one row or one column to a smaller valid matrix, or by adding both. However, the transition formula is incorrect in your plan. The correct transition is: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1] - dp[i-1][j-1] + 2^{min(i,j)} modulo 998244353.

4. Base Case: The base case is dp[0][0] = 1, dp[i][0] = dp[0][j] = 1 for all i and j. This represents the fact that there is only one valid matrix with 0 rows or 0 columns, which is the empty matrix.

5. Iterative Solution: For tabulation, initialize a 2D array dp of size N+1 x M+1 with base case values. Then, fill up the rest of the dp table iteratively using the transition relationship. The final answer will be dp[N][M].
