Your plan seems to be on the right track. However, it's missing the transition function, which is the core of the dynamic programming solution. The transition function describes how to get the dp[i][j] from its previous states. Without this, we cannot build up the solution from the base case to the final answer.

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-down approach with memoization: This approach starts from the original problem and breaks it down into subproblems. The results of these subproblems are stored for future reference to avoid repeated calculations. This approach is generally more intuitive and easier to implement, but it may lead to a larger space complexity due to the use of recursion.
2. State Expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid matrices with i rows and j columns. This state expression will be used to build up the solution to the problem.
3. Base Case: dp[0][0] = 1, as there is exactly one valid matrix with 0 rows and 0 columns, which is the empty matrix.
4. Transition Function: For each valid matrix with i rows and j columns, we can add a new row or a new column to form a valid matrix with i+1 rows and j columns or i rows and j+1 columns. Therefore, dp[i][j] can be obtained from dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1]. However, the exact transition function needs to be further considered and verified.
5. Tabulation: This is a bottom-up approach where you start with the simplest subproblem and gradually build up to the original problem. This approach is iterative and generally leads to better space complexity. The tabulation for this problem would involve creating a 2D table with dimensions N x M and iteratively filling it up using the state expression and transition function.
===END PLAN===

Please think about the transition function and the constraints of this problem. The transition function is crucial to the solution and must be accurate.
