Your plan seems to be on the right track as it correctly identifies the problem as a dynamic programming problem. However, there are some issues with your transition function. The condition `A_{a, b} * A_{c, d} <= A_{a, d} * A_{c, b}` does not depend on the current cell (i, j, k, l), but on the whole matrix. Therefore, it's not possible to calculate the transition function based on only one cell. 

Instead, we should use a different approach. We can calculate the number of matrices for each possible value of `A_{a, b}` and `A_{c, d}`. For each value of `b` and `d`, we can calculate the number of matrices `A_{a, b}` and `A_{c, d}` respectively. The transition function should be `dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i - a][b] * dp[a][j - b] for all possible a and b)`. 

The base case is correct. When `i = j = 1`, `dp[i][j] = 1`. 

Here is the revised plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This approach starts from the smallest subproblem and builds up to the solution of the original problem. It generally leads to a more efficient space usage and avoids the overhead of recursion. However, it might be less intuitive and harder to implement.
2. Base Case: For base case, `dp[i][j]` is 1 when `i = j = 1` because a single cell matrix always satisfies the condition.
3. Transition: From the state `dp[i][j]`, we can transition to the new state `dp[i + a][j + b]`. The transition function should be `dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i - a][b] * dp[a][j - b] for all possible a and b)`.
4. Iterate over the array in a bottom-up manner. For each cell (i, j), calculate the transition function and update `dp[i][j]` accordingly.
5. The answer is `dp[N][M]`.
