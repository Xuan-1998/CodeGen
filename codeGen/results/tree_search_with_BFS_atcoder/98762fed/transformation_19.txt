Your plan seems to be on the right track, but it needs a bit more clarification. Here is an updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State Expression: We'll use a 4-dimensional dynamic programming array `dp[i][j][k][l]` to denote the number of matrices that satisfy the condition for the submatrix from (i, j) to (k, l). Here, (i, j) and (k, l) are the top-left and bottom-right corners of the submatrix respectively.
2. Base Case: The base case would be `dp[i][j][i][j] = 2` for all i and j, as a single cell can either be 0 or 1 and both satisfy the condition.
3. We then iterate over the dimensions of the submatrix, starting from the smallest and going up to the original matrix size. For each submatrix, iterate over all possible positions for the cells (a, b) and (c, d).
4. Transition Function: The transition function would be a bit tricky as we need to consider the values at (a, b), (a, d), (c, b), and (c, d). We need to ensure that `A[a][b] * A[c][d] <= A[a][d] * A[c][b]`. This condition can be satisfied in two ways: either `A[a][b] = A[c][d] = 0` or `A[a][d] = A[c][b] = 1`. So, we need to consider these two cases in our transition function.
5. The answer will be `dp[1][1][N][M]` modulo 998244353.
===END PLAN===

This plan seems to be complete and correct, but the transition function might be complex due to the condition we need to satisfy. Also, the time complexity might be high as we're using a 4-dimensional DP array and iterating over all possible positions for the cells (a, b) and (c, d). We might need to optimize it further if it doesn't run within the time limit.
