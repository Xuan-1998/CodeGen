Your plan seems to be on the right track, but there are a few points that need to be clarified and corrected:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define a 4-dimensional DP array dp[i][j][k][l] where i and j denote the number of rows and columns respectively, and k and l denote the current row and column respectively. The value of dp[i][j][k][l] will represent the number of matrices with i rows and j columns that satisfy the condition starting from the current position (k, l).

2. Base Case: For base case, dp[i][j][i][j] is 1 because a single cell matrix always satisfies the condition.

3. Transition: From the state dp[i][j][k][l], we can transition to four new states: dp[i+1][j][k][l], dp[i][j+1][k][l], dp[i][j][k-1][l], dp[i][j][k][l-1]. These transitions are incorrect because they represent expanding or shrinking the matrix in different directions, which does not make sense in the context of the problem. Instead, we should calculate the value of dp[i][j][k][l] based on its subproblems. Specifically, dp[i][j][k][l] should be the sum of dp[i-1][j][k-1][l], dp[i][j-1][k][l-1], dp[i-1][j][k-1][l-1] and dp[i][j-1][k][l-1] modulo 998244353, if these states are valid (i.e., within the bounds of the matrix).

4. The final answer should be dp[N][M][N][M] because it represents the total number of matrices with N rows and M columns that satisfy the condition.
===END PLAN===

Please note that the plan is still quite high-level and may need to be refined further to account for implementation details, such as how to handle the case where i, j, k, or l is 0. Also, the time and space complexity of this approach is O(N^2 * M^2), which could be quite large if N and M are both close to 400. It may be necessary to come up with a more efficient approach if performance is a concern.
