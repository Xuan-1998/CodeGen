Your plan seems to be on the right track for a dynamic programming solution. However, the transition function is not clear in your plan. Here is an updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-down approach with memoization: This approach starts from the original problem and breaks it down into subproblems. The results of these subproblems are stored for future reference to avoid repeated calculations. This approach is generally more intuitive and easier to implement, but it may lead to a larger space complexity due to the use of recursion.

2. State Expression: Let dp[i][j][k][l] represent the number of valid matrices with i rows and j columns, where the last row has k 1s and the last 1 in the last row is at position l. This state expression will be used to build up the solution to the problem.

3. State Initialization: dp[i][j][k][l] is initialized as 0. For base case, dp[1][i][j][k] = 1 for all valid i, j, k.

4. Transition Function: The transition function should consider the number of 1s in the current row and the position of the last 1. If we put a 1 at position l in the current row, we should have a transition from dp[i-1][j][k][p] for all p <= l and k <= j. If we put a 0 at position l in the current row, we should have a transition from dp[i-1][j][k][p] for all p and k.

5. Tabulation: This approach involves creating a table and filling it up with solutions to subproblems in a bottom-up manner. The final solution to the problem is then obtained from the sum of all dp[N][M][i][j] for all valid i, j. The time complexity is O(N^2 * M^2) and the space complexity is also O(N^2 * M^2).
