I think your plan is correct in terms of the dynamic programming approach and the bottom-up strategy. However, the state expression and the transition function are missing. 

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State Expression: dp[i][j][k][l] represents the number of matrices that satisfy the condition for the submatrix from (i, j) to (k, l).
2. Initialize a 4D array dp of size (N+1)x(M+1)x(N+1)x(M+1) with all elements as 0. dp[i][j][k][l] represents the number of matrices that satisfy the condition for the submatrix from (i, j) to (k, l).
3. Base Case: The base case would be dp[i][j][i][j] = 1 for all i and j, as a single cell always satisfies the condition.
4. Transition Function: For each submatrix from (i, j) to (k, l), we iterate through all possible values of a and b (1 <= a <= k, 1 <= b <= l). For each pair (a, b), we update dp[i][j][k][l] by adding dp[i][j][a][b] * dp[a+1][b+1][k][l], taking modulo 998244353 at each step to avoid overflow.
5. The answer will be dp[1][1][N][M], which represents the number of matrices that satisfy the condition for the entire matrix.
===END PLAN===

Note: The transition function assumes that the condition is satisfied for all submatrices from (i, j) to (a, b) and from (a+1, b+1) to (k, l). This is because any matrix that satisfies the condition can be divided into four submatrices that also satisfy the condition.
