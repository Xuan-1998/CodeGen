Your plan seems to be on the right track. However, it seems a bit complex and could be simplified. The condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} actually means that either both A_{a, b} and A_{c, d} are 0, or both A_{a, d} and A_{c, b} are 1. This is because the only way the inequality holds for all a, b, c, d is if the left-hand side is always 0 (which requires A_{a, b} and A_{c, d} to be 0) or the right-hand side is always 1 (which requires A_{a, d} and A_{c, b} to be 1).

So, we can simplify the problem to counting the number of matrices where each row and each column is either all 0s or all 1s. We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem, where dp[i][j] is the number of such matrices with i rows and j columns. The transition would be dp[i][j] = 2 * dp[i-1][j] + 2 * dp[i][j-1] - dp[i-1][j-1], because each new row or column can be either all 0s or all 1s, but we subtract dp[i-1][j-1] to avoid double-counting matrices that are already counted in dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1]. The base case would be dp[0][0] = 1, because there is one such matrix with 0 rows and 0 columns (the empty matrix).

Here is the updated plan:

1. Initialize a 2-D array dp with dimensions (N+1) x (M+1), and set dp[0][0] = 1.
2. For each i from 0 to N, and for each j from 0 to M, calculate dp[i][j] = 2 * dp[i-1][j] + 2 * dp[i][j-1] - dp[i-1][j-1]. If i or j is 0, then dp[i][j] = 1, because there is one such matrix with 0 rows or 0 columns.
3. The answer is dp[N][M] modulo 998244353.
