Here is the updated plan:

1. State: The state can be represented as dp[i][j][k][l] where i and j are the starting points and k and l are the ending points of a sub-matrix. The value of dp[i][j][k][l] is the count of matrices that satisfy the condition.

2. Base Case: For base case, dp[i][j][i][j] is 1 because a single cell matrix always satisfies the condition.

3. Transition: For each sub-matrix (i, j) to (k, l), compute dp[i][j][k][l] by checking if the condition is satisfied for all quadruples (a, b, c, d) within the sub-matrix. If the condition is satisfied, add the count of satisfying matrices from the smaller sub-matrices to dp[i][j][k][l]. 

4. Tabulation: This involves creating a 4D table dp with dimensions N x M x N x M. Initialize all cells to 0. Then fill in the base cases dp[i][j][i][j] = 1. Then, for each sub-matrix (i, j) to (k, l), compute dp[i][j][k][l] using the transition function. 

5. Order of computation: The order of computation should be from smaller sub-matrices to larger ones. This can be achieved by iterating over the size of the sub-matrix, then the starting point.

6. Answer: The final answer is the sum of all values in the dp table, modulo 998244353.

7. Optimization: The time complexity of this approach is O(N^4), which is too high. We can optimize it by noticing that the condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} is equivalent to A_{a, b} \leq A_{a, d} and A_{c, b} \leq A_{c, d}. This means we only need to check if the elements in each row and column are non-decreasing. We can precompute the number of non-decreasing sequences of length l for each possible ending element, and use this to efficiently compute the dp values.

8. Final time complexity: With this optimization, the time complexity becomes O(N^2 * M^2), which is feasible for N, M <= 400.
