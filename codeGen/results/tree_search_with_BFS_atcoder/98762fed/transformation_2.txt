Your plan seems correct. It's a dynamic programming problem and the state transition you have mentioned seems to work. However, you need to be careful with the power operation in the transition. The power operation can be large and may cause overflow. You can use the fast power method to calculate it under modulo 998244353. The fast power method can calculate a^n in O(logn) time complexity. Also, you need to initialize the dp matrix with base cases. Here is the updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-down approach with memoization: This approach starts from the original problem and breaks it down into subproblems. The results of these subproblems are stored for future reference to avoid repeated calculations. This approach is generally more intuitive and easier to implement, but it may lead to a larger space complexity due to the use of recursion.
2. State Expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid matrices with i rows and j columns. This state expression will be used to build up the solution to the problem.
3. Transition: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1] - dp[i-1][j-1] + fastPower(2, i*j, 998244353). This transition relationship is based on the principle of inclusion and exclusion, and the fact that any submatrix with i rows and j columns can be formed by adding one row or one column to a smaller valid matrix, or by adding both. The fastPower function calculates the power under modulo 998244353 in O(logn) time complexity.
4. Initialize the dp matrix with base cases. dp[i][0] = dp[0][j] = 1 for all valid i and j. This represents the case where the matrix has only one row or one column.
5. For memoization, you could start by initializing a 2D array dp of size N+1 x M+1 with all elements as -1. Then, define a recursive function solve(i, j) that returns dp[i][j] if it is not -1. Otherwise, it calculates dp[i][j] using the transition relationship, stores the result in dp[i][j], and returns dp[i][j].
