Your plan to use dynamic programming with a bottom-up strategy is a good start. However, the state expression you have defined seems to be too complicated and might lead to a very high time complexity. Also, the condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} seems to be hard to apply directly in dynamic programming.

Let's try to simplify the problem. Notice that for any 2x2 submatrix, it should be either [[0,0],[0,0]], [[0,1],[0,1]], [[1,0],[1,0]], or [[1,1],[1,1]] to satisfy the condition. The whole matrix is just a combination of these 2x2 submatrices. 

So, we can define dp[i][j] as the number of ways to create an i x j matrix. We can calculate dp[i][j] by summing up the product of dp[p][q] and dp[i-p][j-q] for all possible p and q. We need to consider all four types of 2x2 submatrices, so the final formula will be:

dp[i][j] = dp[p][q] * dp[i-p][j-q] * 4 for all 0 <= p <= i and 0 <= q <= j

And for the base case, dp[0][0] = 1 as there is one way to create a 0x0 matrix (which is an empty matrix).

This plan should work for any N and M within the constraints, and it should be complete and correct as it considers all possible ways to create the matrix. Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define dp[i][j] as the number of ways to create an i x j matrix that satisfies the condition.
2. Set the base case: dp[0][0] = 1.
3. For each i from 0 to N and each j from 0 to M, calculate dp[i][j] by summing up the product of dp[p][q] and dp[i-p][j-q] for all possible p and q. Multiply the sum by 4 to consider all four types of 2x2 submatrices.
4. Return dp[N][M] modulo 998244353 as the final answer.
===END PLAN===
