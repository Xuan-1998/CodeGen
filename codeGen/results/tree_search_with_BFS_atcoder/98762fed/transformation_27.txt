Your plan seems to be on the right track with using dynamic programming, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The problem statement doesn't specify any condition that can be used to determine whether a matrix satisfies the condition or not, so it's not clear how to determine the transition between states in the dynamic programming table.

2. The transition you proposed seems to be incorrect. The dp[i][j][k][l] represents the number of matrices that satisfy the condition with i rows and j columns. So, it should transition to four new states: dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]. But it's not clear what the transition function should be.

3. The base case you proposed is not correct. The base case should be dp[1][1] = 2, which represents the two possible matrices (0 or 1) with 1 row and 1 column.

Here is an updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize a 4D array dp[N+1][M+1][N+1][M+1] to store the number of matrices that satisfy the condition with i rows and j columns. dp[i][j][k][l] represents the number of matrices that satisfy the condition with i rows and j columns where k and l are the indices of the last row and column that was changed.
2. Set the base case: for all i, j, set dp[i][j][i][j] to 2, which represents the two possible matrices (0 or 1) with 1 row and 1 column.
3. For each cell dp[i][j][k][l] in the dp table, compute the value based on the previous states dp[i-1][j][k][l], dp[i][j-1][k][l], dp[i-1][j][k-1][l], dp[i][j-1][k][l-1]. The transition function needs to be determined based on the problem statement.
4. The final answer is the sum of all dp[N][M][i][j] for all i, j.
===END PLAN===

Please note that the transition function is not clear from the problem statement and needs to be determined. Also, this approach might not be efficient because it involves a 4D dynamic programming table.
