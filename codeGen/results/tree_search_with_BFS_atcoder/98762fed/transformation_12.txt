The plan seems to be in the right direction, but it lacks details on how the state transition will be performed. We need to define how we can use the solved subproblems to solve the next subproblem. 

Let's update the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State Expression: dp[i][j][k][l] represents the number of matrices that satisfy the condition for the submatrix from (i, j) to (k, l).
2. Initialization: dp[i][j][i][j] = 2 for all valid i, j. This is because a single cell matrix can be either 0 or 1.
3. State Transition: For each submatrix from (i, j) to (k, l), we can calculate dp[i][j][k][l] based on the smaller submatrices. We need to consider two cases:
   3.1. If we fix the top-left cell (i, j) and the bottom-right cell (k, l), we can calculate the number of matrices by multiplying the number of matrices for the submatrix from (i+1, j+1) to (k, l) and the number of matrices for the submatrix from (i, j) to (k-1, l-1).
   3.2. If we fix the top-right cell (i, l) and the bottom-left cell (k, j), we can calculate the number of matrices by multiplying the number of matrices for the submatrix from (i+1, j) to (k, l-1) and the number of matrices for the submatrix from (i, l+1) to (k-1, j).
4. The final answer is dp[1][1][N][M].
5. Modulo Operation: Since the result can be very large, we need to take modulo 998244353 at each step to avoid overflow.
