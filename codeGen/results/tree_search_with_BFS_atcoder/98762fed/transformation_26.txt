The plan you provided seems to be a good starting point for a dynamic programming solution. However, there are a few points that need to be clarified or corrected.

===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===

1. Bottom-up strategy with tabulation: This approach starts from the smallest subproblem and builds up to the solution of the original problem. It generally leads to a more efficient space usage and avoids the overhead of recursion. However, it might be less intuitive and harder to implement.

2. Base Case: For base case, dp[i][j][i][j] is 1 because a single cell matrix always satisfies the condition.

3. Transition: The transition function seems to be incorrect. The condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} is not directly related to the dp states. We need to come up with a new transition function that captures the essence of the problem. The new transition function could be something like this: dp[i][j][k][l] = dp[i][j][k-1][l] + dp[i][j-1][k][l] - dp[i][j-1][k-1][l] if A_{i, j} \times A_{k, l} \leq A_{i, l} \times A_{k, j}.

4. Initialize a 4D array dp of size (N+1)x(M+1)x(N+1)x(M+1) and set all values to 0. This will serve as the memoization table.

5. After the dp table is filled, the answer to the problem will be dp[N][M][N][M] % 998244353.

===END UPDATED PLAN===

Please note that the transition function needs to be further refined. The condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} is not directly related to the dp states and we need to come up with a new transition function that captures the essence of the problem.
