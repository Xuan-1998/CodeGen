1. Top-down approach with memoization: This approach starts from the original problem and breaks it down into subproblems. The results of these subproblems are stored for future reference to avoid repeated calculations. This approach is generally more intuitive and easier to implement, but it may lead to a larger space complexity due to the use of recursion.
2. Base Case: The base case would be when either the number of rows or columns is 1. In these cases, there are 2 possibilities for each cell (0 or 1), so the number of valid matrices is 2^(number of cells). Therefore, dp[i][1] = dp[1][j] = 2^(i*j) for all valid i and j.
3. Transition: For each state dp[i][j], we need to consider adding a new row or a new column. When adding a new row, we have 2^j possibilities for the new row. Each of these possibilities can be combined with any of the dp[i-1][j] valid matrices. Similarly, when adding a new column, we have 2^i possibilities for the new column, which can be combined with any of the dp[i][j-1] valid matrices. Therefore, the transition relationship is dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] * 2^j + dp[i][j-1] * 2^i.
4. Memoization: This is a top-down approach where we start solving the problem by breaking it into subproblems. We store the results of the subproblems in a data structure (like an array or a dictionary) so we don't have to solve them again when needed later.
5. Modulo Operation: As the problem asks for the answer modulo 998244353, we need to take the modulo operation after each calculation to avoid overflow and to keep the numbers manageable. Therefore, every calculation involving the dp array should be followed by a modulo operation.
