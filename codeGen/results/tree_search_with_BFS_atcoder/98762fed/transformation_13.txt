Your intuition about using dynamic programming is correct. However, the state definition seems to be a bit complex and it might be difficult to come up with a transition function. 

Here is a simpler and more feasible plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===

1. State Expression: dp[i][j] represents the number of matrices that satisfy the condition with i rows and j columns.

2. State Transition: To get the dp[i][j], we need to consider all possible ways to form a matrix with i rows and j columns. We can add a new row or a new column to a smaller matrix. When we add a new row, we have 2^j choices (each element in the new row can be 0 or 1). Similarly, when we add a new column, we have 2^i choices. Thus, we have the state transition equation:
dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] * 2^j + dp[i][j - 1] * 2^i

3. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 2, because a 1x1 matrix can have 2 valid values (0 or 1).

4. The final answer will be stored in dp[N][M], which represents the number of valid matrices for the entire matrix.

5. Since the constraints are 1 <= N, M <= 400, this approach will run in a reasonable time.

===END PLAN===
