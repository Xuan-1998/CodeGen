Your plan is on the right track, but it seems like you have misunderstood the problem a bit. The condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} for every quadruple of integers (a, b, c, d) such that 1 \leq a < c \leq N and 1 \leq b < d \leq M is a bit complex. It's not just about the number of rows and columns, but also about the arrangement of the 0s and 1s in the matrix. 

So, instead of just considering the number of rows and columns, we should also consider the number of 1s in each row and column. 

The state dp[i][j] should represent the number of valid matrices of size i*j with a certain number of 1s in each row and column. 

Then, we have to iterate over all possible numbers of 1s in the last row and last column, and update the dp table accordingly. 

For each number of 1s in the last row, we have to calculate the number of ways to distribute these 1s among the columns, and similarly for the last column. 

Then, we have to multiply these two numbers together and add them to the dp table. 

Finally, we return the sum of all dp[i][j] modulo 998244353.

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define the state dp[i][j][k][l] to represent the number of valid matrices of size i*j with k 1s in the last row and l 1s in the last column.
2. Initialize a 4D dp table with dimensions (N+1)*(M+1)*(N+1)*(M+1). Fill the base cases dp[1][1][k][l] = 1 for all valid k and l.
3. Then, for each cell dp[i][j][k][l], iterate over all possible numbers of 1s in the last row and last column, and update the dp table accordingly. For each number of 1s in the last row, calculate the number of ways to distribute these 1s among the columns, and similarly for the last column. Then, multiply these two numbers together and add them to the dp table.
4. Return the sum of all dp[i][j][k][l] modulo 998244353.
===END PLAN===
