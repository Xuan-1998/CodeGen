Your plan seems to be on the right track. However, there are a few things to consider:

1. The condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} is equivalent to saying that the values in the matrix are non-decreasing in both row-wise and column-wise. This can simplify the problem and reduce the number of states in the DP.

2. The 4-D DP seems to be overkill for this problem. The reason is that the transition only depends on the last row and column, not all previous rows and columns. Therefore, we can reduce the DP to 2-D.

3. The modulo operation should be applied at each step to prevent overflow.

Here is the revised plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===

1. State Expression: dp[i][j] represents the number of matrices that satisfy the condition for the submatrix from (1, 1) to (i, j).

2. Transition: The transition relation would be based on the last row and column. For each possible value of the last row and column, we would calculate the number of ways to fill the rest of the submatrix such that the condition is satisfied. This can be done by summing over the number of ways for smaller submatrices, i.e., dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1].

3. Initialization: dp[1][1] = 2, because the first cell can be either 0 or 1.

4. Iteration: Iterate over i from 1 to N and j from 1 to M, and calculate dp[i][j] based on the transition relation.

5. Answer: The answer is dp[N][M] modulo 998244353.
