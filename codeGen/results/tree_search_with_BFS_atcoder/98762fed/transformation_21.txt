The plan seems to be going in the right direction as it correctly identifies the problem as a dynamic programming problem. However, it misses a key point: the problem asks for the number of matrices that satisfy a certain condition, and not just any submatrix. This means the DP state dp[i][j][k][l] is not enough to represent the condition in the problem.

We need to consider the number of ways to fill in the matrix such that the condition is satisfied. For this, we can use a 3-dimensional DP, where dp[i][j][k] represents the number of ways to fill a matrix of size i*j such that the maximum number in the matrix is k.

The transition would be to consider adding a new row or a new column to the matrix. If we add a new row, the number of ways would be dp[i+1][j][k] += dp[i][j][k] * (k+1)^j. If we add a new column, the number of ways would be dp[i][j+1][k] += dp[i][j][k] * (k+1)^i.

The base case would be dp[1][1][k] = 2 for all k, as a single cell matrix can either be 0 or 1.

Finally, we need to sum up all dp[N][M][k] for all k to get the total number of matrices that satisfy the condition, and take the result modulo 998244353.

The updated plan is as follows:

1. Define a 3-dimensional DP, where dp[i][j][k] represents the number of ways to fill a matrix of size i*j such that the maximum number in the matrix is k.
2. Initialize the base case: dp[1][1][k] = 2 for all k.
3. For each cell dp[i][j][k] in the DP table, consider adding a new row or a new column to the matrix and update the DP table accordingly.
4. After filling up the DP table, sum up all dp[N][M][k] for all k and take the result modulo 998244353 to get the answer.
5. Return the answer.
