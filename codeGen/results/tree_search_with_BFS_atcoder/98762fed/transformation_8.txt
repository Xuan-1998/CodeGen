Your plan looks almost correct, but there is a mistake in the transition part. The transition is not simply adding a new row or column. We need to consider the interaction between the new row or column and the existing ones. Specifically, for each cell in the new row or column, there are 2 choices: 0 or 1. If it's 0, then it doesn't affect the condition. If it's 1, then it must be larger than or equal to all the cells in the same column or row in the existing matrix. Therefore, we need to sum over all the possible positions of 1s in the new row or column. This leads to a more complex transition relationship. 

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-down approach with memoization: This approach starts from the original problem and breaks it down into subproblems. The results of these subproblems are stored for future reference to avoid repeated calculations. This approach is generally more intuitive and easier to implement, but it may lead to a larger space complexity due to the use of recursion.
2. Base Case: The base case would be when either the number of rows or columns is 1. In these cases, there are 2 possibilities for each cell (0 or 1), so the number of valid matrices is 2^(number of cells). Therefore, dp[i][1] = dp[1][j] = 2^(i*j) for all valid i and j.
3. Transition: For each state dp[i][j], we need to consider adding a new row or a new column. When adding a new row, we have 2^j possibilities for the new row. Each of these possibilities can be combined with any of the dp[i-1][j] valid matrices. Similarly, when adding a new column, we have 2^i possibilities for the new column, which can be combined with any of the dp[i][j-1] valid matrices. However, we need to sum over all the possible positions of 1s in the new row or column. Therefore, the transition relationship is more complex and requires additional computation.
4. Tabulation: This approach is a bottom-up method where we solve all the subproblems first, then solve the problem based on the solutions to the subproblems. It's typically implemented using a table to store the results of subproblems.
