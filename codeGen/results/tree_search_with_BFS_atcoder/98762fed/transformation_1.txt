Your plan seems to be on the right track. However, it lacks the details on how to calculate the dp[i][j] from the smaller subproblems. Here's the updated version of the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define the problem in terms of smaller subproblems: We are given positive integers N and M. We need to find the number of matrices with N rows and M columns where each element is 0 or 1, that satisfy the given condition, modulo 998244353. 

2. State Expression: Let dp[i][j][k][0] represent the number of valid matrices with i rows and j columns, where the last element in the i-th row is 0 and there are k 1's in the i-th row. Similarly, let dp[i][j][k][1] represent the number of valid matrices with i rows and j columns, where the last element in the i-th row is 1 and there are k 1's in the i-th row.

3. Base Cases: For base case, dp[0][j][k][0] = dp[0][j][k][1] = 0 for all j, k. dp[i][0][0][0] = 1 and dp[i][0][k][1] = 0 for all i, k > 0.

4. Recursive Relation: For the recursive step, we add up the number of valid matrices for all possible configurations of the previous row. This is done by iterating over all possible numbers of 1's in the previous row and considering both cases where the last element in the current row is 0 or 1.

5. Compute the answer: The answer to the problem is the sum of all dp[N][M][k][0] and dp[N][M][k][1] for all k.

6. Optimization: Use memoization to avoid repetitive calculation. Store the result of each subproblem in a 4D array and use it to calculate the result of larger subproblems.

7. Time Complexity: The time complexity for this approach is O(N^2M^2) because for each cell in the dp table, we iterate over all possible numbers of 1's in the current and the previous row. The space complexity is also O(N^2M^2) because of the 4D dp table.
