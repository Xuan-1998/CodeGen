Your plan seems to be on the right track, but it's somewhat vague and lacks details on how to handle the given condition and how to transition from one state to another in the dynamic programming table. Here is a more detailed plan:

1. State Definition: Define a 4D dp array where dp[i][j][k][l] represents the number of matrices that satisfy the condition for the submatrix from (i, j) to (k, l). Initialize the dp array with zeros.

2. Base Case: For each cell (i, j) in the matrix, there are two possibilities (0 or 1). Therefore, dp[i][j][i][j] should be initialized as 2.

3. State Transition: For each submatrix (i, j) to (k, l), we need to consider two cases:
    - If the current cell is in the same row or the same column as the previous cell, we can freely choose 0 or 1 (2 possibilities). Therefore, dp[i][j][k][l] += 2 * dp[i][j][k-1][l] * dp[i][j][k][l-1].
    - If the current cell is not in the same row or column as the previous cell, we need to satisfy the given condition. Therefore, dp[i][j][k][l] += dp[i][j][a][b] * dp[a+1][b+1][k][l] for all valid (a, b) (a <= k, b <= l).

4. Final State: The final state is dp[1][1][N][M], which represents the number of matrices that satisfy the condition for the entire matrix.

5. Output: Print dp[1][1][N][M] % 998244353.

This plan should handle the given condition correctly and cover all possible matrices. However, it may not be efficient enough for large inputs due to the high dimensionality of the dp array and the complexity of the state transition. You may need to find a way to optimize the state transition.
