Your plan seems to be on the right track. However, the state expression is not completely defined and it's not clear how you plan to transition between states. Also, the condition for the matrices is not clearly defined in your plan. 

Here's an updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define the state as dp[i][j][k][l] which represents the number of matrices that satisfy the condition for the submatrix from (i, j) to (k, l). 

2. Initialize the dp array with 0s. For each cell (i, j), dp[i][j][i][j] should be 2 because a cell can be either 0 or 1.

3. For each submatrix, calculate the number of valid matrices by iterating over all possible values of a, b, c, and d. 

4. If a cell (x, y) satisfies the condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b}, add dp[a][b][x][y] * dp[x+1][y+1][c][d] to dp[a][b][c][d].

5. Modulo the result by 998244353 at each step to prevent overflow.

6. The final answer is dp[1][1][N][M].
===END PLAN===

This plan should work for all inputs within the given constraints. However, it might be not efficient for larger inputs due to the multiple nested loops. We will need to come up with some optimization techniques if we need to handle larger inputs.
