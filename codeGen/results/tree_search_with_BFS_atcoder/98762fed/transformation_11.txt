The plan you provided seems to be on the right track as it correctly identifies this problem as a dynamic programming problem. However, it's a bit vague and not detailed enough to be implemented directly. Here is a more detailed version of the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State Expression: dp[i][j][k][l] represents the number of matrices that satisfy the condition for the submatrix from (i, j) to (k, l). 

2. Initial State: Initialize dp[i][j][k][l] as 0 for all valid i, j, k, l. We will fill this dp table in a bottom-up manner. 

3. State Transition: For each submatrix, calculate the number of valid matrices by considering all possible values for the corners of the submatrix. If a corner value makes the matrix invalid, do not count it. Otherwise, add the product of the number of valid matrices for the two submatrices divided by the corner to the count for the current submatrix.

4. Iterate over the submatrix dimensions (i, j, k, l) in increasing order. For each submatrix, calculate dp[i][j][k][l] using the state transition rule. 

5. For each submatrix, we consider two cases: when the top-left corner is 0 and when it is 1. If it is 0, then all elements in the submatrix must be 0. If it is 1, then the elements in the first row and the first column must be 1 and the remaining submatrix can be any valid matrix. We sum up the counts of these two cases to get the count for the current submatrix.

6. The final answer will be dp[1][1][N][M] modulo 998244353.
===END PLAN===

This plan should be correct as it considers all possible valid matrices and counts them correctly. It also handles the edge cases where the submatrix has only one row or one column. The plan should be complete and ready to be implemented in code.
