The plan seems to be good at first glance, but there are some issues that need to be addressed. 

1. The matrix is not given, so we cannot check if a sub-matrix satisfies the condition for all quadruples. We need to find the number of matrices that satisfy the condition, so we cannot use the condition directly in our dynamic programming state transition.

2. The dimension of the dp table is too large. It's not feasible to create a 4D dp table with dimensions N x M x N x M, as the constraints are up to 400. The time complexity would be O(N^4 * M^4), which is not acceptable.

3. The condition A_{a, b} \times A_{c, d} \leq A_{a, d} \times A_{c, b} actually implies that if a cell is 1, then all cells to its top and left must be 1. This is because if A_{a, b} is 1 and A_{c, d} is 0, then the condition will not be satisfied. Therefore, we can simplify the problem to counting the number of matrices that satisfy this new condition.

Given these points, here is an updated plan:

1. State: The state can be represented as dp[i][j] where i and j are the number of rows and columns of a sub-matrix. The value of dp[i][j] is the number of sub-matrices that satisfy the condition.

2. Base Case: For base case, dp[1][j] and dp[i][1] are 2^{j} and 2^{i} respectively, because for a single column or row, we can choose 0 or 1 for each cell.

3. State Transition: For dp[i][j], it equals the sum of dp[k][j] * dp[i-k][j] for k from 1 to i, plus the sum of dp[i][k] * dp[i][j-k] for k from 1 to j. This is because we can split the matrix into two parts either vertically or horizontally, and the number of matrices is the product of the number of matrices of the two parts.

4. Final Answer: The final answer is dp[N][M] modulo 998244353.

5. Time Complexity: The time complexity is O(N^2 * M^2), which is acceptable for the constraints. 

6. Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(N * M), which is also acceptable. 

This new plan should be more feasible and efficient.
