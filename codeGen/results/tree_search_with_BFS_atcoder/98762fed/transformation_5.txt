Your plan seems to be on the right track as you identified the problem as a dynamic programming problem and outlined a general approach to solve it. However, you didn't specify how you will transition from one state to another, which is a crucial part of any dynamic programming problem. Also, your base case needs to be more comprehensive as there are more cases than just an empty matrix. 

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-down approach with memoization: This approach starts from the original problem and breaks it down into subproblems. The results of these subproblems are stored for future reference to avoid repeated calculations. This approach is generally more intuitive and easier to implement, but it may lead to a larger space complexity due to the use of recursion.

2. State Expression: Let dp[i][j] represent the number of valid matrices with i rows and j columns. This state expression will be used to build up the solution to the problem.

3. Base Case: dp[i][0] = dp[0][j] = 1 for all i, j. This is because a matrix with 0 rows or 0 columns is always valid.

4. State Transition: For each cell dp[i][j], we need to consider all possible combinations of cells in the previous rows and columns. Specifically, dp[i][j] will be the sum of all dp[k][l] where k < i and l < j. This is because for a matrix to be valid, every 2x2 submatrix must also be valid.

5. Memoization: This is a top-down approach where you start with the original problem and break it down into subproblems. The results of these subproblems are stored for future reference to avoid repeated calculations. For this problem, memoization would involve creating a 2D array with dimensions N x M and filling it up as and when required by the state expression.
