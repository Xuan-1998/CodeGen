Your plan seems to be on the right track, but it seems to be missing a few key details. Here's an updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-down approach with memoization: This approach starts from the original problem and breaks it down into subproblems. The results of these subproblems are stored for future reference to avoid repeated calculations. This approach is generally more intuitive and easier to implement, but it may lead to a larger space complexity due to the use of recursion.

2. Base Case: The base case would be when either the number of rows or columns is 1. In these cases, there are 2 possibilities for each cell (0 or 1), so the number of valid matrices is 2^(number of cells). Therefore, dp[i][1] = dp[1][j] = 2^(i*j) for all valid i and j.

3. State: dp[i][j] represents the number of valid matrices of size i*j. The state dp[i][j] depends on the states dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1], but it's not as simple as just adding these two states. We need to consider all possible combinations of previous rows and columns. This will involve a nested loop for each of the previous rows and columns, and the calculation will involve power and multiplication operations, which should be done under modulo 998244353 to prevent overflow.

4. Memoization: This approach involves a top-down strategy and uses a memo table to avoid repeated calculations. Initialize a 2D memo table with dimensions (N+1)*(M+1) and fill it with a default value (e.g., -1). Define a recursive function that takes i and j as parameters and returns the number of valid matrices of size i*j. In this function, first check if the current state is already calculated in the memo table. If it is, return the calculated value. If not, calculate it based on the states dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1], store it in the memo table, and then return it. The initial call will be to this function with parameters N and M.

5. Output: Finally, print the value of dp[N][M] as the result.
