Your plan seems to be on the right track, but it's a bit vague and lacks the details of how you will update the dp array. Here is a more detailed plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===

1. State Expression: dp[i][j][k][l] represents the number of matrices that satisfy the condition for the submatrix from (i, j) to (k, l). The first two indices represent the top left corner of the submatrix and the last two indices represent the bottom right corner of the submatrix.

2. Initialization: Initialize a 4D array dp[N+1][M+1][N+1][M+1] to store the number of matrices that satisfy the condition for each submatrix. All elements of the dp array should be initialized to 0 except for dp[i][j][i][j] which should be initialized to 2 for all valid i and j. This is because a 1x1 matrix can either have the value 0 or 1, hence there are 2 possibilities.

3. Tabulation: Start from the smallest submatrix (1, 1) and iterate through to the largest submatrix (N, M). For each submatrix, iterate through all possible values for each cell and update dp[i][j][k][l] accordingly. To do this, you will need to consider the four possible states for each pair of cells (a, b) and (c, d) in the submatrix: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 1). Then, update dp[i][j][k][l] based on these states and the values of dp[i][j][a][b], dp[i][j][c][d], dp[a][b][k][l], and dp[c][d][k][l].

4. Final State: The final state would be dp[1][1][N][M], which represents the number of matrices that satisfy the condition for the entire matrix.

5. Take the modulo 998244353 at each step to prevent overflow.
