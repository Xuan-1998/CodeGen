The plan you proposed seems to have a correct direction. However, there are some missing details. 

1. We need to clarify the base cases for the DP table. For example, when the submatrix only contains one cell, it can only be 0 or 1, so dp[i][j][i][j] = 2.
2. The transition function is not clearly defined. We need to figure out how to update dp[i][j][k][l] based on the smaller subproblems.
3. The time complexity of the plan is O(N^4), which may exceed the time limit when N, M <= 400. We need to optimize the plan to make it more efficient.

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State Expression: dp[i][j][k] represents the number of matrices that satisfy the condition for the submatrix from (i, j) to (i, k).
2. Initialize a 3D array dp with dimensions N x M x M. The state dp[i][j][k] will store the number of matrices that satisfy the condition for the submatrix from (i, j) to (i, k).
3. Base Case: dp[i][j][j] = 2 for all i, j because when the submatrix only contains one cell, it can only be 0 or 1.
4. Transition Function: dp[i][j][k] = dp[i-1][j][k] * 2^(k-j+1) + dp[i][j][k-1] * 2^(i-1) - dp[i-1][j][k-1] * 2^(k-j+i-1) for all i > j, j < k.
5. The final result is dp[N][1][M] mod 998244353.
===END PLAN===
