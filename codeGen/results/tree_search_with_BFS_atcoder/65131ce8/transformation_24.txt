Your plan seems correct and it indeed is a dynamic programming problem. However, your plan is missing the recurrence relation that will be used to compute dp[i][j][k]. Also, you will need to take into account the modulo operation in your calculations to prevent overflow.

Here is an updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Base case: dp[i][1][1] = 1 (a single node is always a good vertex), and dp[i][1][0] = 0 (a single node cannot be a non-good vertex).
2. State: dp[i][j][k] represents the number of good trees with 'i' vertices, 'j' out-degrees from the root, and 'k' indicating whether the root is a good vertex (k=1) or not (k=0).
3. Iterate over all states of 'i', 'j', and 'k'. For each state, compute dp[i][j][k] using the following recurrence relation:
   - dp[i][j][k] = sum(dp[i-l][j-1][k'] * dp[l][d[l]][k] * C[i-1][l-1]) for all l in [1, i] and k' in [0, 1] where C[i][j] is the binomial coefficient.
   - Also, dp[i][j][1] += sum(dp[i-l][j][0] * dp[l][d[l]][1] * C[i-1][l]) for all l in [1, i].
4. The result will be the sum of dp[N][d[i]][1] for all i in [1, N].
5. All calculations should be done modulo 998244353 to prevent overflow.
===END PLAN===
