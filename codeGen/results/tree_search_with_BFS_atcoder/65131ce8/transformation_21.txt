Your plan seems solid and covers the problem requirements well. It correctly identifies the problem as one of dynamic programming and sets out a clear strategy for constructing the DP table. Your state expression is correct and your transition function seems reasonable. 

However, there seems to be a slight confusion in the memoization part. The base case for the recursion should be when there are no more nodes to distribute (j = 0), not necessarily when we are at the last node (i = N). So, the base case should be solve(i, 0, k) = 1 for all i and k. 

Here is your updated plan with this correction:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State expression: dp[i][j][k] represents the number of ways to construct the subtree rooted at i, with j nodes, and whether node i is a good vertex (k=1) or not (k=0).

2. Transition: dp[i][j][k] can be calculated by summing up the ways to construct subtrees for all children of i. For each child c, we iterate over all possible sizes of the subtree rooted at c and add to dp[i][j][k] the product of the number of ways to construct the subtree rooted at c and the number of ways to distribute the remaining nodes among the other children. If i is a good vertex, we also add to dp[i][j][1] the number of ways to construct a subtree rooted at i with j-1 nodes where i is not a good vertex.

3. Memoization: Initialize a 3D array dp[N+1][N+1][2] with -1, which represents unsolved states. Then, define a recursive function solve(i, j, k) that returns the number of ways to construct the subtree rooted at i, with j nodes, and whether node i is a good vertex (k=1) or not (k=0). This function checks if dp[i][j][k] is not -1, and if so, returns it. Otherwise, it calculates dp[i][j][k] using the same logic as in the tabulation approach and returns it. The base case is solve(i, 0, k) = 1 for all i and k. The final answer is the sum of solve(1, N, k) for all k.
===END PLAN===
