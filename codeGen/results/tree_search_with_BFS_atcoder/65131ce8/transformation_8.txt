The plan seems mostly correct and complete, but it lacks some details about the transition between states in the dynamic programming solution. Also, it is not clear how the given sequence of out-degrees is used in the plan.

Here is an updated version of the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Use a top-down approach with memoization: This approach will start from the root and recursively solve the problem for its children. It will use a memoization table to store the results of subproblems to avoid recomputation. This approach is usually easier to implement but may suffer from stack overflow issues for large inputs.

2. Define the state: dp[i][j] represents the number of good trees with 'i' nodes and 'j' good vertices.

3. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1, as a single node tree has only one good vertex (the root itself). For all other 'j', dp[1][j] = 0, as there are no good trees with a single node and more than one good vertex.

4. Transition: To fill dp[i][j], iterate over all 'k' from 1 to 'i-1' and add dp[k][j-1]*dp[i-k][1] to dp[i][j]. This represents the case where the root is a good vertex and the remaining 'i-1' nodes form 'j-1' good vertices. Also, add dp[k][j]*dp[i-k][1] to dp[i][j] for all 'k' from 1 to 'i-2'. This represents the case where the root is not a good vertex and the remaining 'i-1' nodes form 'j' good vertices.

5. Use the given sequence of out-degrees: The number of good trees with 'i' nodes is multiplied by the number of ways to choose 'd_i' children from 'i-1' remaining nodes.

6. The final answer will be the sum of dp[n][j] for all 'j' from 1 to 'n', modulo 998244353.
===END PLAN===
