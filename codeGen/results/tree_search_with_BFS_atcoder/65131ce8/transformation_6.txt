The plan seems correct and covers the problem statement well. It correctly identifies the need for dynamic programming and outlines the state definition and base case. However, the plan does not provide a clear transition function to calculate dp[i][j] from previously computed values. Here is an updated plan with the transition function:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-down approach with memoization: This approach will start from the root and recursively solve the problem for its children. It will use a memoization table to store the results of subproblems to avoid recomputation. This approach is usually easier to implement but may suffer from stack overflow issues for large inputs.
2. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1, as a single node tree has only one good vertex (the root itself). For all other 'j', dp[1][j] = 0, as there are no good trees with a single node and more than one good vertex.
State: dp[i][j] represents the number of good trees with 'i' nodes and 'j' good vertices.
3. Transition Function: For each node 'i' from 2 to 'n', calculate dp[i][j] for each 'j' from 1 to 'i'. For each possible parent 'p' of 'i' (where 'p' is less than 'i'), add dp[p][j-1]*dp[i-p][j] to dp[i][j]. This represents the number of ways to form a good tree with 'i' nodes and 'j' good vertices by combining a good tree with 'p' nodes and 'j-1' good vertices and a good tree with 'i-p' nodes and 'j' good vertices.
4. The answer to the problem is the sum of dp[n][j] for all 'j' from 1 to 'n', modulo 998244353.
===END PLAN===

The transition function assumes that the degrees 'd' are ordered in non-decreasing order. If this is not the case in the input, you will need to sort 'd' before starting the dynamic programming.
