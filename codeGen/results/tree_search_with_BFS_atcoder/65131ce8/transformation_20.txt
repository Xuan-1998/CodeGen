Your plan seems to be on the right track. Dynamic Programming is indeed a good approach for this problem. The state expression and transition you proposed are correct and cover all possibilities. However, there are a few things that I would like to clarify and add to your plan:

1. The out-degree sequence d=(d_1,d_2,...,d_N) gives us the structure of the tree. We can construct the tree by adding edges from the root to the leaves according to the out-degrees. We need to keep track of the parent of each node and the number of remaining out-degrees for each node.

2. The bottom-up strategy with tabulation is a good approach. However, we need to be careful when distributing the nodes among the children of a node. We need to consider all possible distributions that satisfy the out-degrees.

3. When calculating dp[i][j][k], we need to consider the case where i is a good vertex and the case where i is not a good vertex separately. For the case where i is a good vertex, we need to consider all possible sizes of the subtree rooted at i and add to dp[i][j][1] the product of the number of ways to construct the subtree rooted at i and the number of ways to distribute the remaining nodes among the other children. For the case where i is not a good vertex, we need to consider all possible sizes of the subtree rooted at i and add to dp[i][j][0] the product of the number of ways to construct the subtree rooted at i and the number of ways to distribute the remaining nodes among the other children.

4. The base case is dp[i][0][0] = 1 for all i. The final answer is the sum of dp[1][N][k] for all k.

5. The modulo operation should be applied whenever we add or multiply numbers to avoid overflow.

Here is the updated version of the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Construct the tree according to the out-degree sequence d=(d_1,d_2,...,d_N). Keep track of the parent of each node and the number of remaining out-degrees for each node.
2. Initialize a 3D array dp[N+1][N+1][2] with zeros. The base case is dp[i][0][0] = 1 for all i.
3. For each node i from N to 1, calculate dp[i][j][k] for all possible j and k. For each child c of i, iterate over all possible sizes of the subtree rooted at c. Add to dp[i][j][k] the product of the number of ways to construct the subtree rooted at c and the number of ways to distribute the remaining nodes among the other children. Apply the modulo operation whenever adding or multiplying numbers.
4. The final answer is the sum of dp[1][N][k] for all k, modulo 998244353.
===END PLAN===
