Your plan seems to be on the right track. However, it's a bit unclear about how you plan to transition from one state to another in your dynamic programming solution. You need to define the transition function for your DP solution. Here's an updated version of your plan with the transition function:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-down approach with memoization: This approach will start from the root and recursively solve the problem for its children. It will use a memoization table to store the results of subproblems to avoid recomputation. This approach is usually easier to implement but may suffer from stack overflow issues for large inputs.
2. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1, as a single node tree has only one good vertex (the root itself). For all other 'j', dp[1][j] = 0, as there are no good trees with a single node and more than one good vertex.
3. State: dp[i][j] represents the number of good trees with 'i' nodes and 'j' good vertices.
4. Transition function: For each state (i, j), we need to consider all possible ways to distribute the 'i-1' remaining nodes among the 'd_i' children of the root. For each distribution, we calculate the number of good vertices and add the result to dp[i][j].
5. To calculate the number of good vertices, we consider two cases: (1) the root is a good vertex, and (2) the root is not a good vertex. In the first case, we add 1 to the number of good vertices. In the second case, we add the number of good vertices in the subtree rooted at the child with the smallest index.
6. Finally, we add up all the dp[i][j] for all 'j' to get the total number of good vertices for all good trees with 'i' nodes. We return this number modulo 998244353.
7. Since we are using a 2D array of size 'n'x'n' for memoization, the space complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2). The time complexity is also O(n^2) as we are filling up the memoization table in a nested loop.
===END PLAN===

This plan should cover all possible cases and give the correct result. The dynamic programming approach is suitable for this problem as it has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
