Your plan seems to be on the right track, but it lacks some details. Here is a more detailed plan:

1. Initialize the 3D array 'dp' of size (N+1)x(N+1)x2 with all elements set to 0. This array is used to store the results of subproblems, where dp[i][j][k] represents the number of ways to construct a subtree with 'i' vertices, 'j' out-degrees for the root, and 'k' indicates whether the root is a good vertex or not.

2. Base case: dp[i][1][1] = 1 for all i (a single node is always a good vertex), and dp[i][1][0] = 0 for all i (a single node cannot be a non-good vertex).

3. Transition: dp[i][j][k] can be derived from dp[p][q][r] where 'p' is the number of vertices in the subtree, 'q' is the out-degree of the root of the subtree, and 'r' indicates whether the root of the subtree is a good vertex or not. The transition relationship can be expressed as: 
    - dp[i][j][k] += dp[p][q][r] * comb(i-1, p) * comb(j-1, q) (if k=1), and 
    - dp[i][j][k] += dp[p][q][r] * comb(i-1, p) * comb(j, q) (if k=0).
    - Here, 'comb(x, y)' is a function that calculates the combination of 'x' choose 'y'.

4. After the transition, the dp values need to be updated for the next vertex. For each possible out-degree 'j', we update:
    - dp[i+1][j+1][1] += dp[i][j][1] (if the next vertex is a good vertex), and 
    - dp[i+1][j+1][0] += dp[i][j][0] (if the next vertex is a non-good vertex).

5. The answer can be obtained by summing up dp[N][j][1] for all j.

6. Since the answer can be very large, we should do all calculations under modulo 998244353.

7. Finally, print the answer.
