Your plan seems to be on the right track. However, there are a few points that need clarification and modification. 

Here is the updated plan:

1. Define the state of the dynamic programming (DP) as dp[i][j][k] where:
   - i is the current node being considered.
   - j is the total number of nodes in the subtree rooted at node i.
   - k is a binary variable indicating whether node i is a good vertex or not.

2. Initialize the DP table. For each node, there is only one way to construct a subtree with one node (the node itself). So, dp[i][1][1] = 1 for all i.

3. The DP transition is a bit tricky and needs to be handled carefully. For each node i from N to 1 (in decreasing order), for each possible size of the subtree j from 1 to N, calculate the number of ways to construct the subtree rooted at i with j nodes, considering whether node i is a good vertex or not.

   - For k = 0 (i.e., node i is not a good vertex), the number of ways is the sum of the number of ways to construct the subtree rooted at i with x nodes (where x is less than j) considering node i as a good vertex and the number of ways to construct the subtree rooted at the next node (i+1) with (j-x) nodes considering it as a non-good vertex. This is because if node i is not a good vertex, then any node in its subtree can be a good vertex.

   - For k = 1 (i.e., node i is a good vertex), the number of ways is the sum of the number of ways to construct the subtree rooted at i with x nodes (where x is less than j) considering node i as a non-good vertex and the number of ways to construct the subtree rooted at the next node (i+1) with (j-x) nodes considering it as a good vertex. This is because if node i is a good vertex, then no other node in its subtree can be a good vertex.

   - The transition formula is: dp[i][j][k] = dp[i][x][k^1] * dp[i+1][j-x][k] (mod 998244353) for all x from 1 to j-1.

4. The answer to the problem is the sum of dp[i][j][1] for all i from 1 to N and j from 1 to N, modulo 998244353.

5. Note: The input sequence d=(d_1,d_2,...,d_N) is used to limit the size of the subtree. The size of the subtree rooted at node i cannot be larger than d_i.

This plan should cover all edge cases since it considers all possible sizes of subtrees and whether each node can be a good vertex or not. It should be complete and correct as it follows the problem's requirements and constraints.
