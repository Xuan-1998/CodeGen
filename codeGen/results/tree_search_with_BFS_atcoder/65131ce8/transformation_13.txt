Your plan seems solid and it covers the requirements of the problem. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for this problem. The base case is correctly identified as a tree with only one node. The transition function also appears to be correct, as it considers all possible combinations of smaller trees to form a larger tree. Precomputing the combination values is a good optimization to avoid unnecessary computation.

Here is the updated version of the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-down approach with memoization: This approach will start from the root and recursively solve the problem for its children. It will use a memoization table to store the results of subproblems to avoid recomputation. This approach is usually easier to implement but may suffer from stack overflow issues for large inputs.
2. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1, as a single node tree has only one good vertex (the root itself). For all other 'j', dp[1][j] = 0, as there are no good trees with a single node and more than one good vertex.
3. Transition: dp[i][j] can be computed from dp[k][l] where 'k' is less than 'i' and 'l' is less than or equal to 'j'. The transition relationship can be formulated as: dp[i][j] = dp[k][l] * comb(i-1, k-1) * dp[i-k][j-l] where 'comb' represents the combination function. This transition relationship is based on the fact that we can form a good tree with 'i' nodes and 'j' good vertices by combining a smaller good tree with 'k' nodes and 'l' good vertices with another good tree with 'i-k' nodes and 'j-l' good vertices.
4. To avoid recomputation of the combination function 'comb', precompute all required combination values and store them in a 2D array. The combination values can be computed using the formula: comb[i][j] = comb[i-1][j-1] + comb[i-1][j].
5. The final result will be the sum of dp[N][i] for all 'i' from 1 to 'N', modulo 998244353. This represents the sum of the numbers of good vertices for all good trees.
