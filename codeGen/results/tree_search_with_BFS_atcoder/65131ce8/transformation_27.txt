Your plan seems solid as it covers the base case, transition, and tabulation steps of dynamic programming. However, the combinatorial function 'comb' you mentioned is not defined in the plan. I assume that 'comb(a, b)' is a function to calculate combination of 'a' choose 'b', but you should define it explicitly in the plan. 

Also, make sure to handle the case when 'd_1' is not equal to 1, as per the problem statement, 'd_1' is always greater than or equal to 1.

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define a function 'comb(a, b)' to calculate combination of 'a' choose 'b'. This function can be implemented using the formula for combination: `C(a, b) = a! / [(a - b)! * b!]`. However, to avoid overflow, use dynamic programming to calculate the combination.
2. Base case: dp[i][1][1] = 1 (a single node is always a good vertex), and dp[i][1][0] = 0 (a single node cannot be a non-good vertex).
3. Transition: dp[i][j][k] can be derived from dp[p][q][r] where 'p' is the number of vertices in the subtree, 'q' is the out-degree of the root of the subtree, and 'r' indicates whether the root of the subtree is a good vertex or not. The transition relationship can be expressed as: dp[i][j][k] += dp[p][q][r] * comb(i-1, p) * comb(j-1, q) (if k=1), and dp[i][j][k] += dp[p][q][r] * comb(i-1, p) * comb(j, q) (if k=0).
4. Tabulation: Initialize a 3D array 'dp' of size (N+1)x(N+1)x2 with all elements set to 0. Then, fill in the base case and apply the transition relationship iteratively to fill in the rest of the table. Finally, the answer can be obtained by summing up dp[N][j][1] for all j.
5. If 'd_1' is not equal to 1, then there is no good tree exists as per the problem statement. So, in this case, return 0.
===END PLAN===
