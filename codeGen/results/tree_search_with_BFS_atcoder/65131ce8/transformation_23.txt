Your plan seems to be on the right track, but it's not fully fleshed out yet. You've identified that this is a dynamic programming problem and have defined the base case and the state well. However, you haven't defined the transition function, which is a crucial part of any dynamic programming solution. 

Here's an updated version of your plan with the transition function included:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State: dp[i][j][k] represents the number of good trees with 'i' vertices, 'j' out-degrees from the root, and 'k' indicating whether the root is a good vertex (k=1) or not (k=0).
2. Base case: dp[i][1][1] = 1 (a single node is always a good vertex), and dp[i][1][0] = 0 (a single node cannot be a non-good vertex).
3. Transition function: Iterate through 'p' from 1 to 'i-1' and 'q' from 0 to min('j', 'p'). Then, for each pair of 'p' and 'q', add dp[p][q][1]*dp[i-p][j-q][0] and dp[p][q][0]*dp[i-p][j-q][1] to dp[i][j][0], and add dp[p][q][1]*dp[i-p][j-q][0] and dp[p][q][0]*dp[i-p][j-q][0] to dp[i][j][1]. This represents all possible ways of partitioning the 'i' vertices into two subtrees, one with 'p' vertices and the other with 'i-p' vertices, and assigning the out-degrees between them.
4. After filling the dp table, the answer will be the sum of dp[n][d[i]][1] for all 'i' from 1 to 'n', which represents the total number of good trees with 'n' vertices and 'd[i]' out-degrees from the root.
===END PLAN===

This plan should handle all edge cases as it iterates through all possible partitions of the vertices and out-degrees. It's also complete as it covers all necessary steps in a dynamic programming solution: defining the state, base case, and transition function, and computing the final answer from the dp table.
