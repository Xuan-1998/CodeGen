Your plan seems correct for the most part, but there are a few things that need to be clarified. 

First, the problem asks for the sum of the numbers of good vertices for all good trees, but your plan doesn't mention how to calculate this sum. 

Second, your transition function seems a bit confusing. You mentioned that we can form a good tree with 'i' nodes and 'j' good vertices by combining a smaller good tree with 'k' nodes and 'l' good vertices with another good tree with 'i-k' nodes and 'j-l' good vertices, but it's not clear how this combination happens. 

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize a 2D array dp[N+1][N+1] to store the number of good trees with 'i' nodes and 'j' good vertices. dp[i][j] means the number of good trees with 'i' nodes and 'j' good vertices.

2. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1, as a single node tree has only one good vertex (the root itself). For all other 'j', dp[1][j] = 0, as there are no good trees with a single node and more than one good vertex.

3. Transition: For each 'i' from 2 to N, for each 'j' from 1 to 'i', dp[i][j] can be computed from dp[k][l] where 'k' is less than 'i' and 'l' is less than or equal to 'j'. The transition relationship can be formulated as: dp[i][j] = dp[k][l] * comb(i-1, k-1) * dp[i-k][j-l] where 'comb' represents the combination function. This transition relationship is based on the fact that we can form a good tree with 'i' nodes and 'j' good vertices by combining a smaller good tree with 'k' nodes and 'l' good vertices with another good tree with 'i-k' nodes and 'j-l' good vertices.

4. After filling up the dp table, the answer will be the sum of dp[N][j] for all 'j' from 1 to N. This is because for a tree with N nodes, the number of good vertices can be anywhere from 1 to N.

5. Since the answer can be a large number, take the modulus 998244353 to prevent overflow.
