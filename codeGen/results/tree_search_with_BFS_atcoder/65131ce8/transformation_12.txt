Your plan seems correct and well-thought-out. You've correctly identified that this is a dynamic programming problem and your approach of using a top-down method with memoization is a good strategy for this kind of problem. Your base case and transition relation also seem correct. The only thing I would add is to make sure to handle the case where d_i = 0, since this means that the vertex i has no outgoing edges and therefore can't contribute to the count of good vertices. 

Here is the updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-down approach with memoization: This approach will start from the root and recursively solve the problem for its children. It will use a memoization table to store the results of subproblems to avoid recomputation. This approach is usually easier to implement but may suffer from stack overflow issues for large inputs.

2. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1, as a single node tree has only one good vertex (the root itself). For all other 'j', dp[1][j] = 0, as there are no good trees with a single node and more than one good vertex.

3. Handle the case where d_i = 0: If d_i = 0, then vertex i has no outgoing edges and therefore can't contribute to the count of good vertices. In this case, dp[i][j] = 0 for all 'j'.

4. Transition: dp[i][j] can be computed from dp[k][l] where 'k' is less than 'i' and 'l' is less than or equal to 'j'. The transition relationship can be formulated as: dp[i][j] = dp[k][l] * comb(i-1, k-1) * dp[i-k][j-l] where 'comb' represents the combination function. This transition relationship is based on the fact that we can form a good tree with 'i' nodes and 'j' good vertices by combining a smaller good tree with 'k' nodes and 'l' good vertices with another good tree with 'i-k' nodes and 'j-l' good vertices.

5. Implement the transition: for each 'i' from 2 to 'N', and for each 'j' from 1 to 'i', compute dp[i][j] using the transition relationship: dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][l] * comb(i-1, k-1) * dp[i-k][j-l]) for all valid 'k' and 'l'.
