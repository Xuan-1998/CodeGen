Your plan is a good start, but it needs to be expanded and clarified. Here is an updated version of the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. This problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming with a top-down approach with memoization. This approach will start from the root and recursively solve the problem for its children. It will use a memoization table to store the results of subproblems to avoid recomputation. This approach is usually easier to implement but may suffer from stack overflow issues for large inputs.

2. Define the state dp[i][j] which represents the number of good trees with 'i' nodes and 'j' good vertices.

3. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1, as a single node tree has only one good vertex (the root itself). For all other 'j', dp[1][j] = 0, as there are no good trees with a single node and more than one good vertex.

4. Initialize a 2D array dp of size (n+1)x(n+1) with all values as 0. This will be our memoization table.

5. Compute the prefix sums of the input sequence d to get a new sequence p. This will allow us to quickly determine the number of nodes in the subtree of any node.

6. For each node i from 2 to N, do the following:
    - For each good vertex j from 1 to i, compute dp[i][j] as the sum of dp[k][j-1] * dp[i-k][j] for all k from max(1, i - p[i-1]) to min(i-1, p[i-2]), where * represents multiplication.

7. The answer to the problem is the sum of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to N, modulo 998244353. 
===END PLAN===

This plan covers the main steps of the solution. It starts with the initialization of the dynamic programming table and the computation of the prefix sums of the input sequence. Then, it fills the dynamic programming table using a nested loop and a formula that captures the problem's constraints. Finally, it computes the answer as the sum of the values in the last row of the dynamic programming table. 

This plan should handle all edge cases, as it considers all possible numbers of nodes and good vertices. It is also complete, as it covers all the steps from the initialization to the computation of the answer.
