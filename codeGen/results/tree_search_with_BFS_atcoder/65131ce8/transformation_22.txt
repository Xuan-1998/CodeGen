Your plan seems to be on the right track for the problem, but it lacks the transition function for the dynamic programming solution. Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State: dp[i][j][k] represents the number of good trees with 'i' vertices, 'j' out-degrees from the root, and 'k' indicating whether the root is a good vertex (k=1) or not (k=0).

2. Base case: dp[i][1][1] = 1 (a single node is always a good vertex), and dp[i][1][0] = 0 (a single node cannot be a non-good vertex).

3. Create a 3D array 'dp' of size (N+1)x(N+1)x2 initialized with 0. This will serve as the memoization table.

4. Transition: For each possible number of vertices 'i' and out-degrees 'j', iterate over all possible ways to distribute the out-degrees among the subtrees. For each distribution, update dp[i][j][k] and dp[i][j][k+1] based on the number of good trees with 'i' vertices, 'j' out-degrees from the root, and whether the root is a good vertex or not.

5. After filling up the dp table, the answer will be the sum of dp[N][j][1] for all possible out-degrees 'j' of the root, modulo 998244353.

6. Return the answer.
===END PLAN=== 

Please note that the transition function is quite complex and needs careful implementation. It involves iterating over all possible distributions of out-degrees among the subtrees, which requires handling of combinatorics and modular arithmetic. Also, the problem statement doesn't clarify whether the out-degrees are given in any particular order, so the solution must work for any order of out-degrees.
