The plan seems to be on the right track, but there are a few points that need to be clarified and corrected:

1. State Expression: The state dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to form a tree with 'i' nodes and 'j' good vertices. 'i' ranges from 1 to N and 'j' ranges from 0 to i-1.

2. Transition Relationship: The transition from state dp[i][j] to dp[i+1][j'] is determined by the number of good vertices in the subtree rooted at the 'i+1' node. If the 'i+1' node is a good vertex, then j' = j + 1, otherwise j' = j. This seems to be incorrect. The transition should be determined by the degree of the 'i+1' node. If the 'i+1' node has a degree of 'd', then there are 'd' ways to choose the good vertices in the subtree rooted at the 'i+1' node.

3. Memoization: The 2D array dp[i][j] is used for storing the results of subproblems to avoid recomputation. The size of the array will be N x N. The base case is dp[1][1] = 1. Then, for each 'i' from 2 to N and each 'j' from 0 to i-1, if dp[i][j] is not already computed, compute it by considering all possible ways of choosing the good vertices in the subtree rooted at the 'i' node.

4. The output should be the sum of all dp[i][j] (0 <= j <= i-1) for all 'i' from 1 to N, modulo 998244353.

===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===

1. Initialize a 2D array dp[N+1][N+1] with all elements as 0. The state dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to form a tree with 'i' nodes and 'j' good vertices.

2. Set the base case dp[1][1] = 1.

3. For each 'i' from 2 to N, do the following:
   - Read the degree d[i] of the 'i' node.
   - For each 'j' from 0 to i-1, if dp[i-1][j] is not 0, compute dp[i][j] and dp[i][j+1] by considering all possible ways of choosing the good vertices in the subtree rooted at the 'i' node.

4. The output should be the sum of all dp[i][j] (0 <= j <= i-1) for all 'i' from 1 to N, modulo 998244353.
