Your plan seems correct and well thought out. It correctly identifies the problem as a dynamic programming problem and proposes a bottom-up strategy with a state expression that seems suitable for solving the problem. However, I would like to add some more details to your plan to make it more clear and complete.

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Define an array dp[i][j][k] where dp[i][j][k] represents the number of ways to construct the subtree rooted at i, with j nodes, and whether node i is a good vertex (k=1) or not (k=0). Initialize the dp array with 0s.

2. For each vertex i from N to 1 (in descending order), do the following:
   - Set dp[i][1][1] = 1 because there is one way to construct a subtree with only one node (the node itself) and it is a good vertex.
   - For each possible number of nodes j in the subtree rooted at i (from 2 to N), do the following:
     - For each child c of i, do the following:
       - For each possible number of nodes k in the subtree rooted at c (from 1 to j-1), do the following:
         - Add dp[c][k][0] and dp[c][k][1] to dp[i][j][0].
         - If the out-degree of i is less than j-k, add dp[c][k][1] to dp[i][j][1].
       - For each possible number of nodes k in the subtree rooted at c (from 1 to j), do the following:
         - If the out-degree of i is less than j-k+1, add dp[c][k][1] to dp[i][j][1].

3. Calculate the sum of dp[i][j][k] for all i, j, and k. This sum is the total number of good vertices for all good trees. Since the problem asks for this number modulo 998244353, take the sum modulo 998244353.

4. Print the calculated sum as the answer.
===END PLAN===

This plan is complete and should correctly solve the problem. It covers all possible cases and correctly calculates the number of good vertices for all good trees. It also correctly handles the modulo operation required by the problem.
