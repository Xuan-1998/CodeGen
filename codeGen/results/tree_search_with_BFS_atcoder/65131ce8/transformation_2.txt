Your plan seems to be on the right track, but the dynamic programming state expression and transition relationship need to be refined. The problem requires us to calculate the sum of the numbers of good vertices for all good trees, which means we are interested in the number of good vertices in the trees, not just the number of nodes. 

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize a 2D array dp[i][j] with size N x N, where dp[i][j] represents the number of good trees with 'i' nodes and the 'j'th node is the smallest in its subtree. 'i' ranges from 1 to N and 'j' ranges from 1 to i.
2. Initialize a prefix sum array prefix[i] to store the sum of dp[i][j] for all 'j' from 1 to 'i'. This is used to optimize the computation of the transition relationship.
3. Base case: dp[1][1] = 1, as there is only one tree with one node and this node is the smallest in its subtree.
4. Transition relationship: For each 'i' from 2 to N, for each 'j' from 1 to 'i', calculate dp[i][j] by summing up the product of the number of ways to choose the 'j'th node as the smallest in its subtree and the number of ways to form the remaining trees. This can be computed as dp[i][j] = dp[j-1][k] * (prefix[i-1] - prefix[j-1]) for all 'k' from 1 to 'j-1', where prefix[i-1] - prefix[j-1] represents the number of ways to form the remaining trees without choosing the 'j'th node as the smallest in its subtree.
5. After filling the dp array, the answer is the sum of dp[N][j] for all 'j' from 1 to N, modulo 998244353.
===END PLAN===
