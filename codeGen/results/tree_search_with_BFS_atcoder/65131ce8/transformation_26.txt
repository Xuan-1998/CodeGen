Your plan is almost correct, but you missed some details in the transition function. Here is the updated version:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize a 3D dynamic programming table dp[i][j][k] where i represents the number of vertices, j represents the out-degrees from the root, and k indicates whether the root is a good vertex (k=1) or not (k=0). The base case is dp[i][1][1] = 1 (a single node is always a good vertex), and dp[i][1][0] = 0 (a single node cannot be a non-good vertex).

2. The transition function is as follows: For each possible number of vertices 'v' in the left subtree, compute the number of ways to form the left subtree and the right subtree separately, then multiply them together. This should be done for both cases when the root is a good vertex and when it is not.

    dp[i][j][0] = (dp[i-1][j][0] * (d[i] - j + 1) + dp[i-1][j-1][1] * (j - 1)) % mod;
    dp[i][j][1] = (dp[i-1][j-1][0] + dp[i-1][j-1][1]) % mod;

3. After all states have been computed, the final answer will be the sum of dp[N][j][1] for all 'j' modulo 998244353.

4. The time complexity of this approach is O(N^3) as there are N^3 states and each state can be computed in O(1) time. The space complexity is also O(N^3) due to the 3D dynamic programming table.
===END PLAN===
