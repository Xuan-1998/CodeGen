Your plan is on the right track. However, there are a few points that need to be clarified and added:

1. Base case: As you mentioned, dp[i][1][1] = 1 (a single node is always a good vertex), and dp[i][1][0] = 0 (a single node cannot be a non-good vertex). But we also need to initialize dp[i][j][k] = 0 for all other i, j, and k. This is because we haven't found any good trees yet.

2. State: dp[i][j][k] represents the number of good trees with 'i' vertices, 'j' out-degrees from the root, and 'k' indicating whether the root is a good vertex (k=1) or not (k=0).

3. Transition: The transition from dp[i][j][k] to dp[i+1][j+d][k or 1] involves summing over all possible ways of choosing the out-degrees from the root. Here, 'd' is the out-degree of the new vertex added to the tree. If 'd' is less than or equal to 'j', then the new vertex can be a good vertex, so 'k' becomes 1. Otherwise, 'k' remains the same.

4. Iteration: We iterate over all 'i' from 1 to 'N', all 'j' from 1 to 'i', and 'k' from 0 to 1. For each combination of 'i', 'j', and 'k', we iterate over all 'd' from 0 to 'i' - 'j' + 1 and update dp[i+1][j+d][k or 1] accordingly.

5. Answer: The final answer is the sum of dp[N][j][1] for all 'j' from 1 to 'N', modulo 998244353.

This plan looks complete and correct, and it should handle all edge cases because it considers all possible numbers of vertices, out-degrees from the root, and whether the root is a good vertex or not.
