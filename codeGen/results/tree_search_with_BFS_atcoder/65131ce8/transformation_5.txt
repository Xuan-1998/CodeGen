Your plan seems to be on the right track. However, it lacks the detailed explanation on how to fill up the dynamic programming table. Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Understand the problem: The problem is asking to find the sum of the numbers of good vertices for all good trees. A good tree is one that satisfies the out-degree of vertex i is d_i. A good vertex v satisfies f(v)=v, where f(v) is the minimum vertex number of the vertices (including v) in the subtree rooted at vertex v.
2. Define the state: Define dp[i][j] to be the number of good trees with 'i' nodes and 'j' good vertices.
3. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1, as a single node tree has only one good vertex (the root itself). For all other 'j', dp[1][j] = 0, as there are no good trees with a single node and more than one good vertex.
4. State transition: For each i from 2 to N, for each j from 1 to i, dp[i][j] can be calculated as the sum of dp[k][j-1]*dp[i-k][d[i-k]] for all k from 1 to i-1, where dp[k][j-1] represents the number of good trees with 'k' nodes and 'j-1' good vertices, and dp[i-k][d[i-k]] represents the number of good trees with 'i-k' nodes and d[i-k] good vertices. The reason is that we can pick any 'k' nodes to form a subtree with 'j-1' good vertices, and the remaining 'i-k' nodes to form a subtree with d[i-k] good vertices.
5. Compute the answer: The final answer is the sum of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to N, modulo 998244353.
