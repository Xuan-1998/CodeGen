Your plan seems to be on the right track. However, it seems there's a misunderstanding in the state relationship. The number of nodes and the number of good vertices are not directly related. Also, the out-degree of a vertex doesn't affect whether it's a good vertex or not. 

Here's the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-down approach with memoization: This approach will start from the root and recursively solve the problem for its children. It will use a memoization table to store the results of subproblems to avoid recomputation. This approach is usually easier to implement but may suffer from stack overflow issues for large inputs.
2. State Expression: dp[i][j] represents the number of good trees with 'i' nodes and 'j' good vertices. 'i' ranges from 1 to N and 'j' ranges from 0 to N-1.
3. State Relationship: The state dp[i][j] depends on the states of the children of the 'i' node. If the 'i' node has 'k' children, then the state dp[i][j] can be derived from the states dp[k][j-1], dp[k][j], ..., dp[k][j+k-1].
4. Tabulation: Start by initializing a 2D dp table with size N x N. The cell dp[i][j] represents the number of good trees with 'i' nodes and 'j' good vertices. Fill up this table iteratively starting from dp[1][0] up to dp[N][N-1]. Use the state relationship to compute the value of each cell based on the values of previously computed cells. After filling up the table, the answer to the problem is the sum of dp[i][j] for all 'i' and 'j'.
===END PLAN===

The plan now correctly reflects the problem's constraints and requirements. The edge cases are handled by the initialization of the dp table and the iterative process of filling it up. The plan now appears to be complete.
