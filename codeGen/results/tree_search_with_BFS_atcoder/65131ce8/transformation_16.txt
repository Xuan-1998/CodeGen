Your plan seems to be on the right track. Dynamic Programming is indeed a suitable approach for this problem. Your state definition is also correct. However, you didn't mention how to transition from one state to another, which is a crucial part of the dynamic programming approach. You also didn't mention how to initialize your dynamic programming table.

Here is an updated version of the plan:

1. State: dp[i][j][k] represents the number of ways to construct the subtree rooted at i, with j nodes, and whether node i is a good vertex (k=1) or not (k=0).

2. Transition: To transition from one state to another, consider all possible numbers of nodes that the left child of the current node can have. For each possibility, calculate the number of ways to construct the left and right subtrees and update the dp table accordingly.

3. Initialization: Initialize dp[i][j][0] and dp[i][j][1] to 0 for all i and j. Then, for each i, set dp[i][1][0] to 1 if i is not a leaf node (i.e., d[i] > 0), and set dp[i][1][1] to 1 if i is a leaf node (i.e., d[i] = 0).

4. Computation: Compute the dp table in a bottom-up manner, starting from the leaves and moving up to the root.

5. Answer: The answer is the sum of dp[i][j][1] for all i and j, modulo 998244353.

This plan should cover all the cases and provide a correct solution to the problem. However, it's important to note that the actual implementation might be quite complex due to the need to handle the subtrees separately and keep track of the number of nodes in each subtree.
