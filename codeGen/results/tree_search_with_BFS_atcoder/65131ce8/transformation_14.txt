Your plan seems solid and covers all the main points of the problem. It correctly identifies that this problem is a dynamic programming problem and provides a clear transition function. The base case is also well defined. However, there are some points that could be improved or clarified:

1. The plan doesn't mention how to handle the degree sequence 'd'. Since 'd_i' represents the out-degree of vertex 'i', it should be used to limit the number of good vertices that can be formed. Specifically, 'd_i' is the maximum number of good vertices that can be formed by the subtree rooted at vertex 'i'. Therefore, in the transition function, 'l' should be less than or equal to 'd_k' instead of 'j'. 

2. The plan doesn't mention how to initialize the dp array. Usually, we initialize the dp array with -1 or some special value to indicate that the subproblem has not been solved yet. In this problem, we can initialize dp[i][j] with -1 for all 'i' and 'j'. 

3. The plan doesn't mention how to compute the combination function 'comb'. In practice, we can precompute a combination table for all possible values of 'i' and 'k' to speed up the computation.

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-down approach with memoization: This approach will start from the root and recursively solve the problem for its children. It will use a memoization table to store the results of subproblems to avoid recomputation. This approach is usually easier to implement but may suffer from stack overflow issues for large inputs.
2. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1, as a single node tree has only one good vertex (the root itself). For all other 'j', dp[1][j] = 0, as there are no good trees with a single node and more than one good vertex.
3. Transition: dp[i][j] can be computed from dp[k][l] where 'k' is less than 'i' and 'l' is less than or equal to 'd_k'. The transition relationship can be formulated as: dp[i][j] = dp[k][l] * comb(i-1, k-1) * dp[i-k][j-l] where 'comb' represents the combination function. This transition relationship is based on the fact that we can form a good tree with 'i' nodes and 'j' good vertices by combining a smaller good tree with 'k' nodes and 'l' good vertices with another good tree with 'i-k' nodes and 'j-l' good vertices.
4. Initialization: Initialize dp[i][j] with -1 for all 'i' and 'j'.
5. Precompute a combination table for all possible values of 'i' and 'k' to speed up the computation.
6. After filling up the dp array, the sum of the numbers of good vertices for all good trees is the sum of all dp[N][j] for 'j' from 1 to 'N'.
