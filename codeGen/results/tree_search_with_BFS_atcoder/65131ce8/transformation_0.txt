The plan seems correct with the idea of using dynamic programming to solve this problem. However, there are a few points that need clarification.

1. The problem doesn't mention anything about the structure of the tree, so it's not clear how we can determine the children of a node. We can only know the out-degree of each node, which is the number of its children, but we can't determine which nodes are the children. 

2. The state relationship isn't clear. We can't directly derive dp[i][j] from dp[k][j-1], dp[k][j], ..., dp[k][j+k-1] because we don't know the relationship between 'i' and 'k'. 

3. The memoization part is correct. We can use a 2D table to store the results of subproblems. However, we need to figure out how to fill in this table.

Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===

1. State Expression: dp[i][j] represents the number of good trees with 'i' nodes and 'j' good vertices. 'i' ranges from 1 to N and 'j' ranges from 0 to N-1.

2. Initialization: Initialize dp[i][0] to 1 for all 'i' because there is exactly one good tree with 'i' nodes and 0 good vertex, which is a tree where all nodes are not good vertices.

3. State Transition: To fill in dp[i][j], we need to consider all possible ways to distribute the 'i-1' remaining nodes (excluding the root) into 'j' subtrees. For each distribution, multiply the number of ways to form each subtree by the number of ways to arrange the subtrees, and add all these products together to get dp[i][j].

4. Edge Cases: If the input sequence doesn't satisfy the conditions (d_1 >= 1 and sum of d_i = N-1), return 0 because there is no good tree.

5. Result: The sum of dp[N][j] for all 'j' is the total number of good trees. But we need to find the sum of the numbers of good vertices for all good trees. To do this, for each 'j', add dp[N][j] * 'j' to the sum.

6. Modulo Operation: Since the result might be very large, perform all calculations modulo 998244353 to avoid overflow.
