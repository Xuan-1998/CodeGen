Your plan seems to be on the right track, but it needs a bit of clarification and expansion. Here's an updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. We will use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation. This approach will start from the leaves and iteratively solve the problem for their ancestors. It will use a table to store the results of subproblems. 

2. The state expression will be dp[i][j][k] which represents the number of ways to construct the subtree rooted at i, with j nodes, and whether node i is a good vertex (k=1) or not (k=0).

3. Initialize the dp table with 0s. dp[i][0][0] and dp[i][1][1] should be 1 for all i.

4. For each node i, from N to 1, calculate the number of ways to construct the subtree rooted at i, with j nodes, and whether node i is not a good vertex. Use the formula: dp[i][j][0] = dp[i][j][0] + dp[i+1][x][0] * dp[i+1][j-x][1] (mod 998244353), for all x from 1 to j.

5. Also calculate the number of ways where node i is a good vertex. Use the formula: dp[i][j][1] = dp[i][j][1] + dp[i+1][x][1] * dp[i+1][j-x][0] (mod 998244353), for all x from d[i] to j.

6. The answer will be the sum of dp[1][j][1] for all j from 1 to N, modulo 998244353.
===END PLAN===

This plan should cover all cases and correctly count the number of good vertices in all good trees. The dynamic programming approach ensures that all subproblems are solved and used to solve larger problems, ensuring completeness. Edge cases should be handled by the initialization and the range of values for x in the formulas.
