Your plan seems to be on the right track for solving this problem using dynamic programming. However, there might be a little confusion in the state definition. The state dp[i][j] should represent the number of good trees with 'i' nodes and 'j' vertices that can be a root of some subtree (not necessarily good vertices). 

Here's the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-down approach with memoization: This approach will start from the root and recursively solve the problem for its children. It will use a memoization table to store the results of subproblems to avoid recomputation. This approach is usually easier to implement but may suffer from stack overflow issues for large inputs.
2. Base Case: dp[1][1] = 1, as a single node tree has only one vertex that can be a root of some subtree (the root itself). For all other 'j', dp[1][j] = 0, as there are no trees with a single node and more than one vertex that can be a root of some subtree.
3. State: dp[i][j] represents the number of trees with 'i' nodes and 'j' vertices that can be a root of some subtree.
4. To calculate dp[i][j], use the formula dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]*d[i-1] + dp[i-1][j]*(i-d[i]) where d[i] is the out-degree of vertex 'i'.
5. The answer will be the sum of dp[N][j] for all 1 <= j <= N, as we want to count all trees with N nodes and any number of vertices that can be a root of some subtree.
===END PLAN===

This plan should work for any valid input as per the problem constraints. It covers all possible cases and doesn't have any edge cases that haven't been taken into account.
