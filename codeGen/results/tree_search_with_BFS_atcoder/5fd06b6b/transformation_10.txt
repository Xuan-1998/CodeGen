1. Initialize an empty priority queue or heap.
2. For each day, insert the count of elements strictly greater than the current element in the sequence into the priority queue or heap.
3. For each day, pop the smallest element from the priority queue or heap that is still larger than the count of elements strictly greater than the current element in the sequence, and add it to the sum.
4. The final sum will be the minimum possible sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence over 'n' days.
