1. Read the input: Read the length of the sequence 'n' and the sequence itself.

2. Create a priority queue: The priority queue will be used to store the counts of elements strictly greater than the current element in the sequence. The priority queue will be sorted in decreasing order.

3. Initialize variables: Initialize a variable 'sum' to store the minimum possible sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence over 'n' days. Initialize a variable 'max' to store the maximum count of elements strictly greater than the current element in the sequence.

4. Iterate over the sequence: For each day 'i', add the 'i'th element to the priority queue. If the 'i'th element is less than 'max', subtract the difference from 'sum' and update 'max' to the 'i'th element.

5. Calculate the minimum possible sum: After iterating over the sequence, 'sum' will be the minimum possible sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence over 'n' days.

6. Print the result: Print 'sum'.
