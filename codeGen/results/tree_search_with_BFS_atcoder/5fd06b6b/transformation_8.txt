1. Initialize a priority queue with the counts from the sequence.
2. Initialize a variable, `result` to 0, which will hold the minimum possible sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence over 'n' days.
3. For each day from 1 to 'n', do the following:
   - Add the maximum count from the queue to `result`.
   - Remove the maximum count from the queue.
4. The value of `result` at the end of the loop will be the minimum possible sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence over 'n' days.
