1. Read the input sequence and store it in a list.
2. Sort the list in non-decreasing order.
3. Initialize a variable `res` to 0. This variable will store the minimum possible sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence over 'n' days.
4. Iterate over the sorted list. For each element `count`, do the following:
   - If `count` is greater than `res`, then increment `res` by 1.
   - Otherwise, set `res` to `count`.
5. Print `res` as the result.
