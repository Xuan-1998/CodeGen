The plan seems to be a bit off in terms of understanding the problem. The problem is not about dynamic programming but rather about sorting and a greedy approach.

Here is the updated plan:

1. Read the input sequence and store it in a list.
2. Sort the list in non-decreasing order. This is because for each element, we want to assign the smallest possible number that has not been assigned yet and is greater than the number of elements strictly greater than it.
3. Initialize a variable `sum` to store the sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence over 'n' days.
4. Initialize an empty list `assigned` to store the assigned numbers for each day.
5. For each day in the sorted list:
   - If `assigned` is not empty and the last element in `assigned` is less than the current day's count, assign the last element plus one to the current day. Add this number to `sum` and append it to `assigned`.
   - Otherwise, assign the current day's count to the current day. Add this number to `sum` and append it to `assigned`.
6. Print `sum` as the minimum possible sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence over 'n' days.

This plan ensures that the counts are minimized by assigning the smallest possible number that has not been assigned yet and is greater than the number of elements strictly greater than it. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the input sequence and the assigned numbers.
