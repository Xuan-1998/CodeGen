1. Initialize a variable `total_sum` to 0. This variable will store the minimum possible sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence over 'n' days.
2. Initialize a priority queue `pq`. The priority queue is a data structure that always gives the smallest element in O(1) time. We will use it to keep track of the counts of elements strictly greater than the current element in the sequence.
3. Iterate over the counts of elements strictly greater than the current element in the sequence from day 1 to day 'n':
    1. Add the count of the day to the priority queue.
    2. Remove the smallest count from the priority queue and add it to `total_sum`.
4. Print the `total_sum`.
