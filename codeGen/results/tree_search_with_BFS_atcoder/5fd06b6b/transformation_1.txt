Your plan is a good start, but there seems to be a misunderstanding of the problem statement. The problem doesn't ask for the minimum possible sum over 'i' days for all possible sequences. It provides a specific sequence of counts of elements strictly greater than the current element and asks for the minimum possible sum for this sequence. Therefore, a dynamic programming approach might not be necessary. We can solve this problem with a simpler approach.

Here is the updated plan:

1. Read the input sequence and reverse it. The reason for reversing is that we want to process the counts from the last day to the first day. 

2. Initialize a variable `max_count` to 0 and a variable `sum` to 0. `max_count` keeps track of the maximum count we have seen so far, and `sum` keeps track of the sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element.

3. Iterate over the reversed sequence. For each count `c`:
    - If `c` is less than `max_count`, add `c` to `sum` and continue to the next count.
    - If `c` is greater than `max_count`, add `max_count` to `sum` and update `max_count` to `c`.

4. After processing all counts, `sum` will be the minimum possible sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence over 'n' days.

5. Print `sum`.
