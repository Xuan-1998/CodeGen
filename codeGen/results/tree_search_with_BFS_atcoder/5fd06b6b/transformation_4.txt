1. Initialize a priority queue (max heap) and a variable to keep track of the sum.
2. Iterate over the input array from the end to the beginning. For each element, add it to the priority queue and update the sum by subtracting the top element of the queue.
3. The final sum is the answer to the problem.

This approach works because the priority queue keeps track of the maximum elements in the sequence so far. When we subtract the top element of the queue from the sum, we are essentially subtracting the count of elements strictly greater than the current element in the sequence. This ensures that the sum is always the minimum possible sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence.
