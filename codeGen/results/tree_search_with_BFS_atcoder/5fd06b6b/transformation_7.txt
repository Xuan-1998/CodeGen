Your plan looks good and you have the right intuition about using dynamic programming for this problem. However, I think there might be some misunderstanding in the transition relationship. 

The count of elements strictly greater than the current element in the sequence on the 'i'th day, mi, does not contribute to the sum of counts of elements strictly less than the current element. Instead, it indicates the maximum number of elements that can be strictly less than the current element.

So, I suggest a slightly different approach:

1. Create a priority queue to store the counts of elements strictly greater than the current element in the sequence on each day. The priority queue allows us to always access the largest count.

2. Iterate through the sequence from the first day to the 'n'th day. For each day, push the count of the day into the priority queue.

3. Then, pop the top element from the priority queue (which is the largest count) and subtract it from the current day's count. This gives the count of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence on the current day.

4. Add the result to a running total, which will be the minimum possible sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence over 'n' days.

5. Finally, print the running total.

This approach ensures that for each day, we always choose the largest possible count of elements strictly less than the current element, which minimizes the sum of these counts over 'n' days.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n) due to the use of a priority queue, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the counts of elements in the priority queue.
