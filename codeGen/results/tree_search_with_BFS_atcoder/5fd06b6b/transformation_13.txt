The plan you've provided seems to be on the right track. However, I think there's a slight misunderstanding. This problem doesn't seem to be a typical dynamic programming problem. The key to solving this problem is to understand that we need to minimize the total sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence over 'n' days. This can be achieved by always choosing the smallest possible element that satisfies the condition that it's equal to or greater than the maximum of the previous sequence. 

Here's the updated plan:

=== BEGIN PLAN ===

1. Read the integer 'n' from the input, which represents the length of the sequence.
2. Read the sequence of 'n' integers from the input, which represents the counts of elements strictly greater than the current element in the sequence on each day.
3. Initialize a priority queue or a multiset (in languages like C++), which can efficiently handle insertions and deletions while maintaining the elements in a sorted order.
4. For each day from 1 to 'n', do the following:
   1. Insert the count of elements strictly greater than the current element in the sequence on the current day into the priority queue/multiset.
   2. If the size of the priority queue/multiset is greater than the current day, remove the smallest element from the priority queue/multiset.
5. The sum of the elements in the priority queue/multiset is the minimum possible sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence over 'n' days. Print this sum.

=== END PLAN === 

This plan should work for all inputs within the given constraints. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the use of a priority queue/multiset, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the sequence and the elements in the priority queue/multiset.
