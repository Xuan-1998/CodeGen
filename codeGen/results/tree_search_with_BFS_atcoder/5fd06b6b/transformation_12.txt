The plan you provided is a good start, but there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. The problem is not about Dynamic Programming, but rather about sorting and maintaining the order of the sequence. 

Here is the updated plan:

1. Read the input: Read the integer 'n' which represents the length of the sequence. Then read the sequence of integers which represent the count of elements strictly greater than the current element in the sequence on each day.

2. Sort the sequence: Sort the sequence in non-decreasing order. This is because we want to minimize the sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence over 'n' days. By sorting the sequence, we ensure that the counts are as small as possible for each day.

3. Calculate the minimum possible sum: Initialize a variable 'sum' to 0 and a variable 'prev' to -1. Iterate over the sorted sequence. For each element 'x' in the sequence, if 'x' is greater than 'prev', then add 'x' to 'sum' and update 'prev' to 'x'. Otherwise, add 'prev' to 'sum' and decrease 'prev' by 1. This ensures that the count of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence is minimized for each day.

4. Output: Print the value of 'sum' which represents the minimum possible sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence over 'n' days.

This plan handles all edge cases because it considers every element in the sequence. It is complete because it follows all the steps necessary to solve the problem: reading the input, sorting the sequence, calculating the minimum possible sum, and outputting the result.
