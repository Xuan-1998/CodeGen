The plan you proposed is a good start, but it seems to have a misunderstanding about the problem. The problem asks for the minimum possible sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence over 'n' days, not greater than. Also, the Dynamic Programming approach you suggested doesn't seem to fit this problem well because there is no clear subproblem structure that can be leveraged.

Here is the updated plan:
=== BEGIN PLAN ===
1. Read the input sequence and store it in a list.
2. Initialize a priority queue (max heap) to store the counts in decreasing order.
3. Initialize a variable 'sum' to 0, which will store the final result.
4. Iterate over the sequence in reverse order:
   - For each count 'c', do the following:
     - If the priority queue is not empty and its top element is greater than 'c', pop the top element and add it to 'sum'.
     - Push 'c' into the priority queue.
5. After the iteration, if there are still elements left in the priority queue, pop all of them and add to 'sum'.
6. Print 'sum' as the result.
=== END PLAN ===

This plan is based on the observation that we can always choose the largest count available to make the sum as small as possible. The priority queue is used to keep track of the available counts in decreasing order. The reverse iteration ensures that we always choose the largest count that is not greater than the current count 'c'.
