The plan seems to be slightly off track. This problem is not a typical dynamic programming problem. Instead, it can be solved using a priority queue data structure (heap). The idea is to keep track of the maximum elements in the sequence so far and use them to calculate the minimum possible sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence over 'n' days.

Here is the updated plan:

1. Read the input values. Initialize an empty priority queue (heap) and a variable `sum` to keep track of the minimum possible sum. 

2. Iterate over the sequence from the first day to the 'n'th day:

    2.1. For each day 'i', push the count of elements strictly greater than the current element in the sequence on the 'i'th day (mi) into the priority queue.

    2.2. If the size of the priority queue is greater than the count of elements strictly greater than the current element in the sequence on the next day (mi+1), then remove the smallest element from the priority queue and add it to the `sum`.

3. Finally, while the priority queue is not empty, remove the smallest element from the priority queue and add it to the `sum`.

4. Print the value of `sum` as the minimum possible sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence over 'n' days.

The reason why this plan works is because we always want to keep the maximum possible elements in the sequence to minimize the sum. By using a priority queue, we can efficiently keep track of the maximum elements and update the sum accordingly.
