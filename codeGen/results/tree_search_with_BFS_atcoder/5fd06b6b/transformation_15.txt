1. Read the input: First, read the integer 'n' from the input. Then, read the sequence of 'n' integers into a list.

2. Sort the sequence: Sort the sequence in ascending order. This ensures that we add the elements in the sequence in the order of their counts of elements strictly greater than them, which helps to minimize the sum of counts of elements strictly less than the current element.

3. Initialize variables: Initialize a variable 'sum' to 0 to keep track of the sum of counts of elements strictly less than the current element. Initialize a variable 'max' to 0 to keep track of the maximum count of elements strictly greater than the current element.

4. Iterate over the sequence: For each element 'count' in the sequence, if 'count' is greater than 'max', increment 'max' by 1. Add 'max' to 'sum'. This ensures that we add the minimum possible count of elements strictly less than the current element to 'sum', while maintaining the property that the count of elements strictly greater than the current element is 'count'.

5. Print the result: Print the value of 'sum'.
