Your plan seems to be on the right track, but it has a few issues. The main problem is that you are trying to use dynamic programming on a problem that does not have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. This problem is more about careful sorting and maintaining a priority queue.

Here's an updated plan:

1. Read the input sequence and store it in a list, along with the index. The index represents the day number, and the value represents the count of elements strictly greater than the current element in the sequence on that day.

2. Sort the list in ascending order based on the value. If two elements have the same value, sort them in descending order of the index. This ensures that for a given count of elements strictly greater, we always consider the later day first.

3. Initialize a priority queue (or a heap) and a variable to keep track of the sum.

4. Iterate through the sorted list. For each element, if the priority queue is empty or the top of the queue is less than the current day, push the current day into the queue. Otherwise, pop the top of the queue, add it to the sum, and push the current day into the queue.

5. After iterating through the list, while the queue is not empty, pop the top of the queue and add it to the sum.

6. The sum is the minimum possible sum of the counts of elements strictly less than the current element in the sequence over 'n' days.

This plan takes advantage of the fact that for a given count of elements strictly greater, we want to consider the later days first, as they have a higher potential to contribute to the sum. The priority queue helps us keep track of the days that we can still consider, in order of their potential contribution to the sum.
