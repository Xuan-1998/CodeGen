1. Dynamic Programming Approach: The problem is a counting problem which involves finding all possible sequences that satisfy certain conditions. This is a typical scenario where dynamic programming can be applied. We will use a bottom-up approach with tabulation to solve this problem iteratively.
   
2. State Definition: Define a 3D array dp[i][j][k] where i ranges from 0 to N, j ranges from 0 to i, and k ranges from 0 to j. dp[i][j][k] will represent the number of valid sequences of length i that have j distinct elements and k elements that appear exactly once. 

3. Base Case: The base case will be dp[0][0][0] = 1, which represents that there is one valid sequence (an empty sequence) when there are no elements.

4. State Transition: Iterate over the array A from 1 to N (inclusive). For each element A[i], iterate over j from 0 to i (inclusive) and over k from 0 to j (inclusive). For each state (i, j, k), consider the following cases:
   - Case 1: The number A[i] is a new number that does not appear in the previous sequence. In this case, the number of sequences is dp[i-1][j][k] * (j+1-k) * (A[i] - j).
   - Case 2: The number A[i] is a number that appears exactly once in the previous sequence. In this case, the number of sequences is dp[i-1][j][k] * k * (A[i] - j).
   - Case 3: The number A[i] is a number that appears more than once in the previous sequence. In this case, the number of sequences is dp[i-1][j][k] * (j-k+1) * (A[i] - j).
   - Sum up the number of sequences from these three cases and take modulo 998244353 to get dp[i][j][k].

5. Final Answer: The final answer will be the sum of dp[N][j][k] for all valid j and k, modulo 998244353.
