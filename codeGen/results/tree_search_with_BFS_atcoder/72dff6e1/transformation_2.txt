The plan you've proposed seems mostly correct. However, it's important to note how we transition between states in our dynamic programming solution. We can transition from dp[i][j][k] to dp[i+1][j][k] and dp[i+1][j+1][k+1] depending on the current state and the value of A[i+1]. We also need to take into consideration the modulo operation in our calculations to avoid integer overflow. Here is the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-down approach with memoization: This approach is a typical method for solving dynamic programming problems. It starts from the top (the original problem) and breaks it down into subproblems, storing the results of each subproblem to avoid redundant computation. This approach is usually easier to implement but might lead to stack overflow in deep recursion.
2. Base Case: The base case will be dp[0][0][0] = 1, which represents the scenario where no numbers are used.
3. State: The state dp[i][j][k] represents the number of valid sequences of length i, with j distinct numbers, and k being the last number.
4. Transition: From a state dp[i][j][k], we can transition to two states: dp[i+1][j][k] and dp[i+1][j+1][k+1]. The former represents adding a number that has already appeared, and the latter represents adding a new number. However, we must ensure that the number of occurrences does not exceed A[i+1]. Also, the number of distinct numbers j+1 should not exceed A[i+1].
5. Memoization: Initialize a 3D array dp[N+1][N+1][N+1] to store the computed values. The base case dp[0][0][0] = 1. For each state dp[i][j][k], compute the next states based on the current state and the given conditions. If the state has been computed before, return the stored value.
6. Modulo Operation: Since the problem asks for the number modulo 998244353, we need to take the modulo operation in our calculations to avoid integer overflow.
7. Final Answer: The final answer will be the sum of dp[N][j][k] for all valid j and k, modulo 998244353.
