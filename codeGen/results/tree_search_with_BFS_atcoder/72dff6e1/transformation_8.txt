Your plan seems to be on the right track. However, it's not entirely clear how you plan to update your dp array. Here's a more detailed plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State: The state dp[i][j][k] represents the number of valid sequences of length i that have j distinct elements and k elements that appear exactly once. Here, i ranges from 0 to N, j ranges from 0 to N, and k ranges from 0 to j.
2. Base Case: The base case will be dp[0][0][0] = 1, which represents that there is one valid sequence (an empty sequence) when there are no elements.
3. Initialize a 3D array dp with dimensions N+1 x N+1 x N+1 with all elements set to 0. dp[i][j][k] represents the number of valid sequences of length i that have j distinct elements and k elements that appear exactly once. Set dp[0][0][0] = 1.
4. Transition: For each state dp[i][j][k], we can transition to the next state in the following ways:
   a. Add a new element that has not appeared before. This increases the number of distinct elements by 1 and the number of elements that appear exactly once by 1. The transition is dp[i][j][k] -> dp[i+1][j+1][k+1].
   b. Add an element that has appeared exactly once before. This does not change the number of distinct elements but decreases the number of elements that appear exactly once by 1. The transition is dp[i][j][k] -> dp[i+1][j][k-1].
   c. Add an element that has appeared more than once before. This does not change the number of distinct elements or the number of elements that appear exactly once. The transition is dp[i][j][k] -> dp[i+1][j][k].
   Note that each transition is multiplied by the number of ways it can occur, which is given by the sequence A.
5. Compute the dp array by iterating i from 0 to N, j from 0 to i, and k from 0 to j. For each state, update the next states according to the transition rules.
6. The answer is the sum of dp[N][j][k] for all j and k, modulo 998244353.
