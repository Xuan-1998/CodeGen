Your plan seems to be on the right track for solving this problem using dynamic programming. You've correctly identified the state variables and the transitions between states. However, there are a few points that need to be clarified:

1. You've mentioned that the state dp[i][j][k] represents the number of sequences satisfying the conditions. Please note that i represents the number of different numbers used so far, j represents the number of times the current number is used, and k represents the number of times the current number is used in sequence B. 

2. You've mentioned two transitions: using a new number and using the same number again. However, you need to clarify how you will handle these transitions. When using a new number, you should increase i by 1, set j to 1, and decrease k by 1 (since the new number is not part of the sequence B). When using the same number again, you should increase j and k by 1.

3. You've mentioned the base case dp[0][0][0] = 1. However, you need to initialize all other states to 0, since there are no valid sequences initially.

4. You need to consider the constraints of the problem. Specifically, you should ensure that i, j, and k do not exceed N, and that j does not exceed A[i].

Here is the updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize a 3D table dp[i][j][k] where i is the number of different numbers used so far, j is the number of times the current number is used, and k is the number of times the current number is used in sequence B. All states are initially set to 0, except for the base case dp[0][0][0] = 1.

2. For each state dp[i][j][k], consider two transitions:
   - Use a new number: If i < N, increase i by 1, set j to 1, and decrease k by 1. Update dp[i+1][1][k-1] += dp[i][j][k].
   - Use the same number again: If j < A[i], increase j and k by 1. Update dp[i][j+1][k+1] += dp[i][j][k].

3. Iterate over all states in the order i, j, k and apply the transitions.

4. The answer will be the sum of all dp[N][j][k] for all valid j and k, modulo 998244353.
