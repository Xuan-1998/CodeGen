The plan seems to capture the essence of the problem, but there are a few points that need to be addressed:

1. The state definition is slightly incorrect. The third dimension of the DP table should represent the number of elements that have appeared exactly once so far, not the total number of elements seen so far. So, dp[i][j][k] would represent the number of valid sequences of length i with j distinct elements and k elements that have appeared exactly once.

2. The transition function is not clearly defined. For each subproblem, we need to consider the following possibilities:

    a. The current element is new and it appears more than once. We can choose this in Ai - 1 ways.

    b. The current element is new and it appears exactly once. We can choose this in N - j ways as there are N - j elements that have not appeared so far.

    c. The current element has appeared before. We can choose this in j ways as there are j elements that have appeared before.

   The transition would then be:

   dp[i][j][k] = dp[i-1][j][k] * Ai + dp[i-1][j-1][k] * (N - j) + dp[i][j][k-1] * j

3. The base case is dp[0][0][0] = 1 and not dp[N][N][N]. We should start from dp[0][0][0] and build up to dp[N][N][N].

4. The final answer would be the sum of dp[N][j][k] for all valid j and k, not just dp[N][N][N].

Here's the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State Expression: Define the state as dp[i][j][k] where i is the current index, j is the number of distinct elements seen so far, and k is the number of elements that have appeared exactly once so far. dp[i][j][k] represents the number of valid sequences of length i with j distinct elements and k elements that have appeared exactly once.

2. Initialization: Initialize a 3D array dp[N+1][N+1][N+1] with all values as 0. The base case is dp[0][0][0] = 1.

3. Transition: For each subproblem, calculate the value of dp[i][j][k] based on the following possibilities:

    a. The current element is new and it appears more than once. We can choose this in Ai - 1 ways.

    b. The current element is new and it appears exactly once. We can choose this in N - j ways as there are N - j elements that have not appeared so far.

    c. The current element has appeared before. We can choose this in j ways as there are j elements that have appeared before.

   The transition would then be:

   dp[i][j][k] = dp[i-1][j][k] * Ai + dp[i-1][j-1][k] * (N - j) + dp[i][j][k-1] * j

4. Compute the final answer: The final answer would be the sum of dp[N][j][k] for all valid j and k.
