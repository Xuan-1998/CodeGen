Your plan seems to be on the right track. The problem is indeed a dynamic programming problem and your state definition seems to accurately represent the problem's constraints. However, I would suggest a few modifications for clarification and correctness:

1. State Expression: The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j][k], where i is the current index, j is the total number of distinct elements seen so far, and k is the total number of elements seen so far. dp[i][j][k] represents the number of valid sequences of length k with j distinct elements using the first i elements.

2. State Transition: The transition from dp[i-1][j][k] to dp[i][j][k] happens in two ways. First, we can use the new element i, making it distinct. This contributes dp[i-1][j-1][k-1]*min(k-j+1, a[i]) to dp[i][j][k]. Second, we can use an element that we have used before. This contributes dp[i-1][j][k]*max(k-j, a[i]-1) to dp[i][j][k].

3. Memoization: In this approach, we use a 3D array dp[N+1][N+1][N+1] to store the results of subproblems. Initially, all values in dp are undefined. Whenever we need to calculate the value of dp[i][j][k], we first check if it's already defined in dp. If it's defined, we return the stored value. Otherwise, we calculate it based on the values of dp[i-1][j][k], dp[i-1][j-1][k-1] and store it in dp before returning it. The base case is dp[0][0][0] = 1.

4. Final Answer: The final answer is the sum of dp[N][j][N] for all j from 1 to N. This is because we need to consider all possible numbers of distinct elements.

5. Modulo operation: Since we need to find the answer modulo 998244353, we should perform the modulo operation every time we update dp[i][j][k] to prevent overflow.

6. Edge Cases: If a[i] is 0, we cannot make any sequence using element i, so dp[i][j][k] = 0 for all j and k.
