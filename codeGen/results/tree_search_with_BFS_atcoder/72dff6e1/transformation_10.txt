Your plan seems to be on the right track. It uses dynamic programming to solve the problem, which is a good approach for this kind of problem. The state definition and transition equation are well-defined and cover all the necessary cases. Here's the slightly modified version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. State: The state `dp[i][j][k]` represents the number of valid sequences of length `i` that have `j` distinct elements and `k` elements that appear exactly once. Here, `i` ranges from `0` to `N`, `j` ranges from `0` to `N`, and `k` ranges from `0` to `j`.

2. Base Case: The base case will be `dp[0][0][0] = 1`, which represents that there is one valid sequence (an empty sequence) when there are no elements.

3. Transition: Update `dp[i][j][k]` in the following way: `dp[i][j][k] = (dp[i-1][j-1][k-1] * (N-j+1) + dp[i-1][j][k] * (j-k) + dp[i-1][j][k-1] * (k+1) + dp[i-1][j][k] * (j*2-k)) % 998244353`. This equation takes into account all possible ways a new element can be inserted into the sequence.

4. Iterate: Iterate over the entire `dp` array to fill it up using the transition equation.

5. Final Answer: The final answer will be the sum of all `dp[N][j][k]` where `j` and `k` are less than or equal to `A[N]`, modulo `998244353`. This is because the number of occurrences of `i` in `B` is at most `A_i`, and the number of occurrences of `B_i` in `B` is at most `A_i`.
===END PLAN===
