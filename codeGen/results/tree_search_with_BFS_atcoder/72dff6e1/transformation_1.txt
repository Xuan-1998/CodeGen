Your plan seems correct. However, it's important to note that the problem requires the answer modulo 998244353. Therefore, we should take the modulo after each operation to prevent overflow. 

Here is the updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Top-down approach with memoization: This approach is a typical method for solving dynamic programming problems. It starts from the top (the original problem) and breaks it down into subproblems, storing the results of each subproblem to avoid redundant computation. This approach is usually easier to implement but might lead to stack overflow in deep recursion.
2. State Expression: The state can be expressed as dp[i][j][k], where i is the current index, j is the number of different numbers used so far, and k is the number of times the current number is used. dp[i][j][k] will store the number of sequences satisfying the conditions.
3. Memoization: This approach involves creating the same 3D table as in the tabulation approach, but instead of filling it up iteratively, we fill it up on-demand using recursion and store the results of each subproblem to avoid redundant computation. The transitions are the same as in the tabulation approach.
4. Modulo operation: Since the problem requires the answer modulo 998244353, we should take the modulo after each operation to prevent overflow. 
===END PLAN===
