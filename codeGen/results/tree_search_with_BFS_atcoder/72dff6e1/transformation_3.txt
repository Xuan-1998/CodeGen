Your plan seems correct and complete. Here's the detailed plan with some minor modifications and clarifications:

===BEGIN PLAN===

1. Dynamic Programming Approach: We will use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. This approach starts from the simplest sub-problems and iteratively solves larger sub-problems using the solutions of the smaller ones. 

2. State: The state dp[i][j][k] represents the number of valid sequences of length i, with j distinct numbers, and k being the last number. 

3. Base Case: The base case will be dp[0][0][0] = 1, which represents the scenario where no numbers are used.

4. Transition: For each state dp[i][j][k], compute the next states based on the current state and the given conditions. We have two scenarios for transitions:

    - If the last number k is used again, then we have dp[i][j][k] possibilities for the next state. This is because we can append the number k to the end of the sequence, and the number of distinct numbers and the last number do not change.
   
    - If a new number is used, then we have dp[i][j][k] * (j+1) possibilities for the next state. This is because we can append any of the j+1 numbers to the end of the sequence, and the number of distinct numbers increases by 1, and the last number changes.

5. Tabulation: Fill up the dp table iteratively until reaching the final state. Start from the base case dp[0][0][0] = 1, and for each state dp[i][j][k], compute the next states based on the current state and the given conditions. 

6. Final Answer: The final answer will be the sum of dp[N][j][k] for all valid j and k, modulo 998244353. This is because any sequence of length N with valid j and k is a valid sequence.

===END PLAN===

This plan correctly covers all possible scenarios and handles the constraints of the problem. It also takes into consideration the modulo operation required in the problem.
