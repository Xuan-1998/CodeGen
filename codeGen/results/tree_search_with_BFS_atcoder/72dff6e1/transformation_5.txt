Your plan seems to be on the right track. However, it can be made more clear and precise. Here is an updated version of the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize a 3D array dp[N+1][N+1][N+1] for dynamic programming, where dp[i][j][k] represents the number of valid sequences of length i, with j distinct numbers, and the last number occurs k times. All elements in the dp array are initialized to 0. The base case is dp[0][0][0] = 1, which represents the scenario where no numbers are used.

2. Iterate over the dp array in the order of i, j, k. For each element, calculate its value based on the transition relationship. The transition relationship is: dp[i][j][k] = dp[i-1][j-1][k-1] * (N - j + 1) + dp[i-1][j][k] * max(0, j - (k == l)), where l is the last number in the previous state. The first part represents the scenario where a new number is added to the sequence, while the second part represents the scenario where an existing number is repeated.

3. Iterate over the input array A from 1 to N. For each A[i], calculate the sum of dp[N][j][k] for all j and k such that k <= A[i]. This sum represents the number of valid sequences of length N, with j distinct numbers, and the last number occurs at most A[i] times. 

4. The final answer is the sum calculated in step 3, modulo 998244353.

5. Edge Cases: 
   - If N = 1, the answer is 1, because there is only one sequence consisting of a single number.
   - If all A[i] = 1, the answer is N!, because each number can occur exactly once in the sequence.
