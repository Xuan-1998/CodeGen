===BEGIN PLAN===
Avoid overlapping subproblems by considering only unique prefixes in both strings. Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary.

Representing the state as a pair of integers (i, k) where i is the current index in S and k is the number of characters matched in T.

This part looks good! The idea to use a recursive function with memoization to avoid overlapping subproblems is a great approach. 

Represent the state as a tuple (i, k) where i is the current index in S and k is the number of characters matched in T. Then transition from state (i, k) to state (i+1, k+1) if the character at index i in S matches with the next character in T, or stay in the same state if they don't.

This part also looks good! The idea to represent the state as a tuple and then transition between states based on whether the characters match is a good approach. 

Represent the state as a pair of integers (i, k) where i is the current index in S and k is the number of characters matched in T, and use this state to memoize previous function calls.

This part also looks good! The idea to use the state to memoize previous function calls will help avoid recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.
