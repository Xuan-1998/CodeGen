===BEGIN PLAN===
Avoid overlapping subproblems by considering only unique prefixes in both strings. Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary.

Considering the last character of each string separately, defining the state as (i, j) representing the indices of S and T.
The state can be a pair of lists (lis, lit), where lis is the length of the longest common subsequence ending at index i in string S and lit is the length of the longest common subsequence ending at index j in string T. 
Transition from state (lis, lit) to state (lis+1, lit) if the characters at indices i and j are equal, or to state (lis, lit+1) if they are not.

Create a recursive function that calls itself with smaller problem instances until the base case is reached, storing the results in a dictionary to avoid repeated computations.
