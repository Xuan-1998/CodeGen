===BEGIN PLAN===
Avoid overlapping subproblems by considering only unique prefixes in both strings. 
// This approach might not be efficient as we are still dealing with overlapping subproblems, consider using dynamic programming instead.

Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary.
// This is a good start, but the current plan doesn't specify how to use memoization effectively.

Representing the state as a pair of integers (i, k) where i is the current index in S and k is the number of characters matched in T.
// The state representation might not be optimal. Consider using a single integer for both strings instead.

Represent the state as a pair (i, j) where i is the current index in S and j is the current index in T. Then transition from state (i, j) to state (i+1, j+1) if the characters at indices i in S and j in T match, or stay in the same state if they don't.
// This approach might not be efficient as we are still dealing with overlapping subproblems.

Use a dictionary to store the memoized results of subproblems and update the memoization table based on the results.
// This is good, but it would be better to use dynamic programming instead of recursive function.
