===BEGIN PLAN===
Avoid overlapping subproblems by considering only unique prefixes in both strings.

Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary. The base case for the recursion will be when the current characters in S and T are different, or when one of them is exhausted.

Considering the last character of each string separately, define the state as (i, j), representing the indices of S and T. The state can be represented by a tuple (i, j), where i is the current index in string S and j is the current index in string T.

The transition from state (i, j) to state (i+1, j) if the characters at indices i and j are equal, or to state (i+1, j+1) if they are not. This can be achieved by recursively calling the function on the remaining characters if they are not equal.

Modify the recursive function to only consider non-overlapping subproblems by checking if the current character in S is equal to the current character in T, and recursively calling the function on the remaining characters if they are not.

To avoid redundant calculations, use memoization to store the results of subproblems. This can be done using a dictionary where the key is the state (i, j) and the value is the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence ending at that position.

Handle edge cases by returning -1 when one of the strings is exhausted before finding an uncommon subsequence.
