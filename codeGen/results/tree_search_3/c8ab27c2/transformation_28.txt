===BEGIN PLAN===
# The idea is to avoid overlapping subproblems by considering only unique prefixes in both strings.
# Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary.

# Represent the state as a pair (i, k) where i is the current index in S and k is the number of characters matched in T.
# This way, we can store the results of subproblems in the dictionary and avoid recomputing them.

# Transition from state (i, j) to state (i+1, j+1) if the characters at indices i in S and j in T match,
# or stay in the same state if they don't. This is because if we've already matched a character in both strings,
# we can keep moving forward.

# If we reach a state where there are no more unmatched characters in either string, that means we've found
# a subsequence that doesn't exist in T. So, we return the length of this subsequence as our answer.

===END PLAN===

Feedback:
- The plan looks correct overall. You're right that dynamic programming can be used to solve this problem.
- Your representation of the state as (i, k) is good for storing and retrieving memoized values.
- Transitions between states based on character matches or non-matches seem reasonable.

Potential issues with the plan:
- What if there are no unmatched characters left in either string? How do we handle that case?
- How do we ensure that our transitions from state to state don't result in duplicate subproblems being computed?

Edge cases:
- If S and T are empty strings, return 0 (since there are no unmatched characters).
- If S is longer than T but they have the same length of common prefix, return -1 (no uncommon subsequences can be found).

Improvement suggestions:
- Add more specific details about how you'll store and retrieve memoized values in your dictionary.
