===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the longest common suffix (LCS) of two strings. Then, find the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence by subtracting the LCS from the lengths of S and T.

This approach is correct as it correctly identifies the problem as a dynamic programming problem. It also has a clear and concise plan for solving it.

To improve this plan, we can further define the states and transitions. For example, instead of using (length_S, length_T) as the state, we could use two separate variables to store the lengths of S and T.

Here is an updated version of the plan with improved definitions:

Define the state as a tuple (i, j, lcs_length) where i and j are the current positions in strings S and T respectively, and lcs_length is the length of the longest common suffix found so far.

Transition relationship:
- If the current characters at positions i and j match, then update the lcs_length to be one more than its previous value.
- If they do not match, then update the lcs_length to be 0.

Iterate through both strings from left to right, maintaining the state of longest common suffix found so far, and update the state as you go. The final state will contain the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence which is given by subtracting the LCS length from the lengths of S and T.

This plan includes edge cases such as when one string is a prefix or a suffix of the other, or when both strings are identical.
