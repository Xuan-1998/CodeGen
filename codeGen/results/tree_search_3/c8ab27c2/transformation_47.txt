===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the longest common suffix (LCS) of two strings. Then, find the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence by subtracting the LCS from the lengths of S and T.

Define the state as a tuple (length_S, length_T) that stores the lengths of strings S and T.
 Define the state as a pair (i, j) representing the current positions in strings S and T. The transition relationship is based on whether or not the current character in S matches the current character in T.

Maintain a set or list to keep track of all subsequences seen so far in S and T, and update this set/list as you go through both strings.
 
Iterate over the characters in S and T simultaneously. For each pair of matching characters, move forward in both strings (i.e., increment i and j). If the current character in S does not match the current character in T, then consider it a part of the uncommon subsequence.

When you finish iterating over the strings, calculate the length of the LCS as the difference between the lengths of S and T. The shortest uncommon subsequence is the minimum of this difference minus one (to account for the extra character), or -1 if no such sequence exists.

This plan correctly captures the essence of the problem and can be improved by using dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the LCS.
The potential issue with this plan is that it does not handle edge cases properly. For example, what happens when S and T are empty? Another possible issue is that it may not work correctly if there are repeated characters in S and/or T.
To improve the plan, you could add checks for edge cases and use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the LCS.
