===BEGIN PLAN===
To avoid overlapping subproblems, consider only unique prefixes in both strings. Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary.

Define the state as the length of the longest common subsequence found so far between prefixes of S and T.

Consider a state that represents the longest common subsequence ending at each position in both strings, and use this to compute the transition relationship.

Create a dynamic programming table using a 2D list where the rows represent the indices of S and the columns represent the indices of T.

Notice that the plan does not specify how to find the shortest uncommon subsequence. You would need to modify the state definition or add an additional step to find the minimum length of uncommon subsequences.

To improve the plan, consider using a 2D list with extra space for memoization. This can help reduce computation time by avoiding redundant calculations.

Potential issues with the plan include:

* What if S and T are identical? The plan does not account for this edge case.
* How will you handle the case where there is no uncommon subsequence?

To address these concerns, consider adding additional checks or modifications to the state definition to handle these edge cases.

This updated plan addresses some of the issues mentioned earlier. It provides a clear outline of how to approach the problem and includes suggestions for improvement and potential edge cases.
