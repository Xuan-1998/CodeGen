===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify the subsequences of S and T that have common prefix. Use a hashmap to store the frequency of prefixes in both strings.

Define the state as a tuple (prefix, i) where prefix is the common prefix of S[:i] and T[:j]

Think about states as (S_prefix, T_prefix, k) representing the common prefix between S[:k] and T[:l], and transition to a new state if the current prefix is extended or exhausted.

Use dynamic programming to fill up a 2D table, where the state is defined as (prefix, i) and the value at each cell represents the length of the shortest subsequence not being a subsequence in T for the given prefix of S[:i].
