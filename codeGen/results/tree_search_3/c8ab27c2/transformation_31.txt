Your plan is generally correct, and you're on the right track by considering dynamic programming to solve this problem. Here are some thoughts to help refine your approach:

* Your idea of avoiding overlapping subproblems by considering only unique prefixes in both strings is a great starting point. This can be achieved using a sliding window approach.
* Representing the state as a pair of integers (i, k) where i is the current index in S and k is the number of characters matched in T is also correct. This state transition logic will help you keep track of the shortest subsequence ending at each position in S and having a certain number of characters matched in T.
* Your suggestion to implement dynamic programming using a 2D array dp[][] where dp[i][k] represents the length of the shortest subsequence ending at index i in S and having k characters matched in T is also correct.

To further refine your plan, consider the following:

* You might want to add some base cases to handle edge cases, such as when S or T is empty.
* When transitioning from state (i, k) to state (i+1, k+1), you should check if the current character in S matches with the next character in T. If they don't match, you can stay in the same state and update dp[i][k] accordingly.
* You might want to consider a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming, where you fill up the dp[][] array from the base cases to the final answer.

Overall, your plan is on the right track, and with some refinements, it should be able to solve the problem correctly. Keep going!
