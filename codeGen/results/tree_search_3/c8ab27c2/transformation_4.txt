===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify the subsequences of S and T that have common prefix. Use a hashmap to store the frequency of prefixes in both strings.
Define the state as a tuple (prefix, i) where prefix is the common prefix of S[:i] and T[:j]
Define states as (prefix, i) where prefix is the common prefix of S[:i] and T[:j]. Transition from a state to another when the length of the current prefix increases by one.
**ISSUE:** You're not considering the case when there's no common prefix between S[:i] and T[:j]
Apply memoization using a dictionary to store the results of expensive function calls.
**SUGGESTION:** Instead of storing frequency, store the longest common prefix found so far. This way, you can easily find the shortest uncommon subsequence by comparing the lengths.
