===BEGIN FEEDBACK===
Your initial plan is a good start, but there are some potential issues and areas for improvement. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. Determining the longest common suffix (LCS) of two strings:
	* This approach might not be the most efficient way to solve this problem. LCS has its own complexity and might not directly relate to finding the shortest uncommon subsequence.
2. Defining the state as a tuple (i, j):
	* This is a good start, but you didn't specify how the states will be used for dynamic programming.
3. Dynamic programming table dp[i][j]:
	* You defined the state transition relationships, which is correct. However, you didn't mention what values you would assign to dp[i][j].
4. Filling the table according to rules:
	* This part seems correct, but you should also specify the base case (i.e., what happens when i or j reaches 0).
5. Memoization with a dictionary:
	* Using memoization can improve performance by avoiding redundant computations.

To improve your plan:

1. Replace LCS-based approach with a dynamic programming solution that directly computes the shortest uncommon subsequence.
2. Clearly define how states (i, j) will be used for dynamic programming and what values you'll assign to dp[i][j].
3. Specify the base case for filling the table.

Potential issues:

1. Your current plan doesn't guarantee that the computed value represents the shortest uncommon subsequence.
2. The memoization approach might not work effectively if the input strings are very large, as it will still require storing and comparing all possible substrings.

Edge cases to consider:

1. What happens when one of the input strings is empty?
2. What about cases where S and T have no common characters?

Revised plan:
