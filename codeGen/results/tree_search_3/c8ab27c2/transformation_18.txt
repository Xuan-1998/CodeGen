===BEGIN PLAN===
Avoid overlapping subproblems by considering only unique prefixes in both strings. Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary.

Defining the state as the length of the longest common subsequence found so far between prefixes of S and T.
Define the state as the maximum length of uncommon subsequences found so far between prefixes of S and T.

Employ dynamic programming by iterating over both strings simultaneously, using nested loops to build up the solution.
