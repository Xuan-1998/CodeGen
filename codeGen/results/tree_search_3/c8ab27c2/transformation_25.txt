===BEGIN PLAN===
# Potential issue: The plan doesn't explicitly mention how to handle the base case when i or k reaches the end of either string. This might lead to infinite recursion if not handled correctly.

Avoid overlapping subproblems by considering only unique prefixes in both strings.
Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary.
Representing the state as a pair of integers (i, k) where i is the current index in S and k is the number of characters matched in T.
Consider the last character of the subsequence and check if it exists in both strings, then update the states accordingly.

Implement a function that takes two strings as input and initializes a dictionary or a 2D table to store the memoized values. 
This function should handle edge cases such as when one string is empty. It's not clear how the plan will handle this case.
Then returns the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence.

# Edge case: What if the strings are empty? The plan doesn't mention how to handle this case. This could potentially lead to incorrect results or even infinite recursion.
