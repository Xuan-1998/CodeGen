===BEGIN PLAN===
Avoid overlapping subproblems by considering only unique prefixes in both strings. 
Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary.

Representing the state as a pair of integers (i, k) where i is the current index in S and k is the number of characters matched in T.

Consider the last character of the subsequence and check if it exists in both strings, then update the states accordingly.

Use a 2D table dp[i][k] where i is the index in S and k is the number of characters matched in T, with base cases being dp[0][k] = -1 for all k and dp[i][0] = i for all i. Fill up the table iteratively by considering the last character of the subsequence.
