===BEGIN FEEDBACK PLAN===
The overall approach you've taken is correct, focusing on dynamic programming to solve this problem.

===ISSUES WITH THE PLAN===
1. The initial idea of finding the longest common suffix (LCS) of two strings might not be necessary or even applicable in this case. It's essential to revisit this step and consider alternative approaches.
2. Defining a state transition relationship using the dp[i][j] table is correct, but it requires further clarification on how the values are updated based on the matching characters at positions i and j.

===IMPROVED PLAN===
 Define the dynamic programming table dp as 2D array of size (|S|+1) x (|T|+1), where |S| and |T| denote the lengths of strings S and T, respectively. The state transition relationship can be formulated as follows:
- For i=0 or j=0, set dp[i][j] = 0 (base cases: when we've reached the end of either string).
- For i>0 and j>0:
  * If characters at positions i in S and j in T match, then update dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1.
  * Otherwise, set dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) (the maximum length of the subsequence we can find by either moving to the next character in S or T).
3. Implement tabulation by iterating over all possible positions i and j in the strings S and T, updating the dp table accordingly.
4. Finally, return dp[|S|-1][|T|-1] as the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence.

===EDGE CASES===
Consider handling edge cases such as:
- If |S| or |T| is 0, return -1 (since there's no common subsequence).
- If S and T are identical, return the length of S minus 1 (the longest uncommon subsequence).
