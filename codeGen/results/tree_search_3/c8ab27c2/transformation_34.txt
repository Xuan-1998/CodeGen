Determine the longest common suffix (LCS) of two strings. Then, find the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence by subtracting the LCS from the lengths of S and T.

Define the state as a tuple (i, j) where i is the current position in string S and j is the current position in string T.
The state transition relationships can be formulated as follows: 
(i, k+1) transitions to (i, k) if the character at position i in S matches the last character of the LCS in T;
(i, 0) transitions to (i-1, 0) if the current character in S does not match the last character of the LCS in T.

Create a dp table with dimensions (m+1, n+1), where m and n are the lengths of strings S and T respectively. Initialize all elements to 0.
