===BEGIN PLAN===
Avoid overlapping subproblems by considering only unique prefixes in both strings. Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary.

Considering the last character of each string separately, defining the state as (i, j) representing the indices of S and T.
Consider the state as a pair (i, j) representing the current index in strings S and T, respectively, and define transitions based on whether the characters at these indices are equal or not.

Implement recursive function with memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary.
Consider edge cases: 
    - If one string is empty, return the length of the other string.
    - If both strings are empty, return 0.

Note: The plan seems mostly correct. However, it's missing an important step which is to initialize the memoization dictionary before calling the recursive function.

To improve this plan, consider adding a base case for when the last characters in S and T are not equal. In this case, we can skip the current character in both strings and move on to the next one.
