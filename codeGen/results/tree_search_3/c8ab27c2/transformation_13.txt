Your initial intuition that this problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming is correct! It's a great approach to solve this problem.

The idea of considering only unique prefixes in both strings is a good start. This can help avoid overlapping subproblems and make the problem more manageable.

The recursive function with memoization is also a good choice, as it will allow us to store and reuse previously computed values to avoid redundant computation.

However, there are a few areas where your plan could be improved:

1. You mentioned that the state can be represented by a tuple (i, j), but you didn't specify what these values represent or how they would affect the transition between states.
2. Your plan doesn't explicitly mention how to determine if a subsequence is uncommon in both strings.

To improve your plan, I suggest the following:

1. Define the state more clearly: Instead of just representing the indices (i, j), you could specify that i represents the current position in string S and j represents the current position in string T. Then, use this definition to determine how to transition between states.
2. Determine what makes a subsequence uncommon: Think about how you can modify your plan to check if a given subsequence is not present in the other string. This could involve comparing the two strings character by character or using some other approach.

Overall, I think your plan has potential, but it needs a bit more refinement and clarification before it's ready for implementation. Keep up the good work!
