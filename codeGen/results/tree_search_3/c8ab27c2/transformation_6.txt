===BEGIN FEEDBACK===
Your plan looks good, but let me add some thoughts and suggestions to improve it.

Firstly, you're correct that this problem involves dynamic programming. By identifying the common prefixes of S and T using a hashmap, you can efficiently store and retrieve frequency information about these prefixes. 

I agree with your definition of the state as (S_prefix, T_prefix, k) representing the common prefix between S[:k] and T[:l]. This is a good starting point for your dynamic programming approach.

To improve your plan, consider the following:

1. **Edge cases**: Your plan doesn't explicitly address edge cases. Make sure you handle these situations correctly, such as when S or T are empty strings.
2. **State transitions**: Clarify how states transition from one to another based on the common prefix and its frequency in both strings.
3. **Dynamic programming table**: Create a dynamic programming table dp where dp[i][j] represents the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence ending at indices i of S and j of T.

Here's an updated version of your plan with these suggestions incorporated:
