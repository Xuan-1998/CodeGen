===BEGIN PLAN===
Avoid overlapping subproblems by considering only unique prefixes in both strings. Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary.

Considering the last character of each string separately, defining the state as (i, j) representing the indices of S and T.
Consider the state as a pair (i, j) representing the current index in strings S and T, respectively, and define transitions based on whether the characters at these indices are equal or not.

Use a 2D table dp, where dp[i+1][j+1] is equal to 1 plus the value at dp[i][j] if the characters at indices i in S and j in T are equal; otherwise, it is the minimum of dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1].
