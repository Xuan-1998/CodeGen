===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

Determine the longest common suffix (LCS) of two strings S and T. This can be done by comparing characters from the end of both strings until we find a mismatch.

Then, find the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence by subtracting the LCS from the lengths of S and T.

Define the state as a pair (length_S, length_T) that stores the lengths of strings S and T. This will help us keep track of the current positions in both strings while filling up the dynamic programming array.

Consider a dynamic programming array dp with dimensions (length_S + 1) x (length_T + 1), where dp[i][j] represents the length of the LCS of the first i characters in S and the first j characters in T. This array will store the lengths of all possible subsequences of S and T.

Implement a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming to fill up the dp array by considering all possible subsequences of S and T. Start from the base case where both strings are empty (length_S = 0, length_T = 0), and recursively fill up the dp array until we reach the desired LCS lengths for S and T.

To find the shortest uncommon subsequence, subtract the LCS length from the lengths of S and T.

===END PLAN===

Feedback:

The plan is correct in terms of identifying the longest common suffix (LCS) of two strings. This can be done by comparing characters from the end of both strings until we find a mismatch. The dynamic programming approach to fill up the dp array also looks good.

Potential issues with the plan:

* The plan does not handle edge cases, such as when one or both strings are empty.
* The plan assumes that the LCS is always found, but in reality, it might not be possible to find an LCS if the strings do not have any common characters.

To improve the plan, consider adding edge cases and error handling for situations where no LCS is found. Additionally, you could also optimize the dynamic programming approach by using a more efficient algorithm to fill up the dp array.
