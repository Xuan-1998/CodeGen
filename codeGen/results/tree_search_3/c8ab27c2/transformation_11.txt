===BEGIN PLAN===
Avoid overlapping subproblems by considering only unique prefixes in both strings. Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary.

Considering the last character of each string separately, defining the state as (i, j) representing the indices of S and T. The state can be represented by a tuple (i, j), where i is the current index in string S and j is the current index in string T.

The state can transition from:
- State (i, j) to state (i+1, j) if the characters at indices i and j are equal
- State (i, j) to state (i+1, j+1) if the characters at indices i and j are not

Using a dictionary to store previously computed values for each unique prefix. This will help avoid redundant computations.

To improve this plan:
* Instead of using recursion with memoization, consider using dynamic programming directly. This can be done by initializing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the length of the shortest subsequence in S up to index i that is not a subsequence in T up to index j.
* Consider sorting both strings and then comparing them character by character. This can help reduce the time complexity.

Potential issues with this plan:
* The current plan does not account for edge cases where one string is longer than the other or when the strings are equal.

To handle these edge cases:
* Initialize dp[0][j] to -1 for all j, because there is no shortest subsequence in an empty string.
* Set dp[i][0] to i-1, where i is the length of S. This represents the case where the entire string S is not a subsequence in T.

This plan does account for edge cases:
* The initializations of dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] handle the edge cases where one string is longer than the other or when the strings are equal.
