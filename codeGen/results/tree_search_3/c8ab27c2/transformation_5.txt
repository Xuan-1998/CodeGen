===BEGIN ANALYSIS AND FEEDBACK===
Your plan seems to be moving in the right direction, but there are a few potential issues that need to be addressed.

1. **Identify the subsequences of S and T that have common prefix**: This step is crucial in identifying the common prefixes between S and T. However, it's important to note that this can be done using a hashmap as you mentioned. You can iterate through both strings and for each pair of characters, check if they are equal. If they are, increment the frequency of that prefix in your hashmap.

2. **Define states as (prefix, i) where prefix is the common prefix of S[:i] and T[:j]**: This step is also important because it defines how you will transition between different prefixes and their corresponding indices. However, it's important to note that this state should not be a tuple but rather an object with two attributes - 'prefix' and 'index'. You can use this object as your state.

3. **Tabulate the lengths of the common prefixes and uncommon subsequences**: This step is where you will actually store the lengths of the common prefixes and uncommon subsequences. You should have a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest uncommon subsequence ending at indices i in S and j in T.

4. **Transition from a state to another when the length of the current prefix increases by one**: This step is important because it defines how you will transition between different states. You can do this by initializing your dp array with the size of the strings plus one, then for each pair of characters in S and T, check if they are equal. If they are, update your state and move to the next character.

5. **Edge cases**: It's important to note that edge cases such as what happens when there are no uncommon subsequences should be handled. You can handle this by initializing your dp array with a value indicating that there are no uncommon subsequences.
