===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the longest common suffix (LCS) of two strings. Then, find the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence by subtracting the LCS from the lengths of S and T.

Define the state as a pair (length_S, length_T) that stores the lengths of strings S and T.
Let the state be (i, j) where i is the current position in string S and j is the current position in string T. The goal is to find the longest common suffix of S[:i] and T[:j].

Create a 2D table where each cell (i, j) stores the length of LCS(S[:i], T[:j]).
