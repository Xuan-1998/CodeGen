===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify the subsequences of S and T that have common prefix. Use a hashmap to store the frequency of prefixes in both strings.

Define the state as a tuple (prefix, i) where prefix is the common prefix of S[:i] and T[:j]

Consider states as (i, j) representing the indices in strings S and T respectively.
Transition from a state to another if the characters at positions i and j are equal.

Use a nested loop to fill up a 2D table where dp[i][j] represents whether the first i characters of S and the first j characters of T have a common prefix.
