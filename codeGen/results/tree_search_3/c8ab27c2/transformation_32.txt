===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the longest common suffix (LCS) of two strings. Then, find the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence by subtracting the LCS from the lengths of S and T.

Define the state as a tuple (i, j) where i is the current position in string S and j is the current position in string T.

Consider two states: (i, k) representing the current position i in string S and the end of the common suffix at position k in string T; (j, 0) where j is the current position in string T and there's no common suffix.

Create a 2D array dp with dimensions len(S)+1 by len(T)+1 to store the lengths of LCS, and update it based on the characters at positions i in S and j in T. The base case for the dynamic programming would be when both strings are empty (i.e., i == 0 and j == 0), where dp[i][j] should be set to infinity.

To calculate the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence, subtract the LCS from the lengths of S and T: len(S) - max(dp[:, len(T)]) or len(T) - max(dp[len(S), :])

The plan seems correct and it covers the base cases for dynamic programming. It's also considering all possible states correctly.

However, there might be a potential issue if the strings are very long. In that case, you would need to optimize your solution by storing only the last two columns of the dp array instead of the whole 2D array.

Edge cases: 
- The lengths of S and T will not exceed 500.
- Both S and T contain at least one character (i.e., their lengths are more than zero).
