===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the longest common suffix (LCS) of two strings. Then, find the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence by subtracting the LCS from the lengths of S and T.

Define the state as a pair (length_S, length_T) that stores the lengths of strings S and T.

Consider a dynamic programming array dp with dimensions (length_S + 1) x (length_T + 1), where dp[i][j] represents the length of the LCS of the first i characters in S and the first j characters in T.

Create a dynamic programming array with dimensions (length_S + 1) x (length_T + 1), where dp[i][j] represents the length of the LCS of the first i characters in S and the first j characters in T, by iterating over each character in both strings.
