===BEGIN PLAN===
Avoid overlapping subproblems by considering only unique prefixes in both strings. 
Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary.

Considering the last character of each string separately, defining the state as (i, j) representing the indices of S and T.
Consider the state as a pair (i, j) representing the current index in strings S and T, respectively, and define transitions based on whether the characters at these indices are equal or not.

Create a dictionary dp where dp[i][j] represents the length of the shortest common subsequence up to index i in S and j in T.
Consider the base case for when the strings are empty (i.e., both S and T have no more characters left).
For each character, if they match, consider the subproblem with indices i-1 and j-1, as the common subsequence has one more element. 
If they don't match, consider the maximum length of the shortest common subsequences without considering this pair of characters.
Finally, return -1 when there is no uncommon subsequence found.
