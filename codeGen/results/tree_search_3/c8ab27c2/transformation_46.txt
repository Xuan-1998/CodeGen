===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the longest common suffix (LCS) of two strings. Then, find the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence by subtracting the LCS from the lengths of S and T.

Define the state as a pair (length_S, length_T) that stores the lengths of strings S and T.
Define the state as a pair (i, j) representing the current positions in strings S and T. The transition relationship is based on whether or not the current character in S matches the current character in T.

Use a 2D array dp to store the lengths of the longest common suffixes for all possible prefixes of S and T. Initialize dp[0][0] as the length of LCS, then fill up the rest of the dp array based on whether or not the current characters match.

Find the minimum value in the dp array that is not equal to the length of the LCS. This will represent the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence.

Note: The plan assumes S and T are non-empty strings.
Potential issues:
- What if one string is a prefix of the other? In this case, the LCS will be the entire shorter string, so the plan should handle this edge case.
- It might be more efficient to store the lengths of the longest common prefixes instead of suffixes, especially when S and T have different lengths.

Edge cases:
- If one or both strings are empty, return 0, since an empty subsequence is considered uncommon.
- Handle the case where LCS is the entire length of either string. In this case, subtracting the LCS from the lengths will give the correct answer.
