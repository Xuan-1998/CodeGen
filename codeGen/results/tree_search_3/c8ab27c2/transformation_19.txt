===BEGIN PLAN===
Avoid overlapping subproblems by considering only unique prefixes in both strings. Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary.

Define an intermediate state as the length of the longest common subsequence found so far between two given prefixes of S and T. This can be calculated by comparing characters at each position in the prefixes. If characters match, increment the length of the common subsequence; if not, move to the next character in either string.

Consider a dynamic programming table dp[][] where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest common subsequence between the first i characters of S and the first j characters of T. 

Define the state as the maximum length of uncommon subsequences found so far between prefixes of S and T. This can be calculated by finding the difference between the lengths of the given strings and the sum of the lengths of all common subsequences.

Recursively calculate dp[i][j] for each pair (i, j) in a bottom-up manner. For each cell, consider two cases: 
1. The last characters in S and T match.
2. They do not match.

In case 1, increment the length of the common subsequence by 1 and move to the next character in both strings.

In case 2, move to the next character in either string (whichever is shorter).

The final answer can be calculated as the maximum difference between the lengths of S and T minus the sum of all common subsequences found so far.
