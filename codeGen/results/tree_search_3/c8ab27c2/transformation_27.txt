===BEGIN PLAN===
Avoid overlapping subproblems by considering only unique prefixes in both strings. Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary.

Representing the state as a pair of integers (i, k) where i is the current index in S and k is the number of characters matched in T.
This representation seems okay, but you might need to consider an additional parameter to track the length of the subsequence.

Represent the state as a pair (i, j) where i is the current index in S and j is the current index in T. Then transition from state (i, j) to state (i+1, j+1) if the characters at indices i in S and j in T match, or stay in the same state if they don't.
This approach might not work because you're considering both strings simultaneously, which could lead to incorrect results. Instead, consider one string at a time.

Represent the state as (i, k) where i is the current index in S and k is the number of characters matched in T, then transition from state (i, k) to state (i+1, k+1) if the characters at indices i in S and k in T match, or stay in the same state if they don't.
This representation is more promising. You can use this approach to build a dynamic programming solution.
