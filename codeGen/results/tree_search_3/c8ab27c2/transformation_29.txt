===BEGIN PLAN===
Avoid overlapping subproblems by considering only unique prefixes in both strings. This approach can be implemented using dynamic programming.

Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary to store function calls and their results to avoid redundant computation.

Represent the state as a tuple (i, k) where i is the current index in S and k is the number of characters matched in T.

Transition from state (i, k) to state (i+1, k+1) if the character at index i in S matches with the next character in T, or stay in the same state if they don't. 

Use a dictionary to store function calls and their results to avoid redundant computation. This can be achieved by storing the result of each function call as (i, k): answer in the dictionary.

To improve the plan:

1. Initialize the memoization dictionary with default values for all possible states (i, k). This can be done using a list comprehension or dictionary comprehension.

2. When transitioning from state (i, k) to state (i+1, k+1), check if the character at index i in S matches with the next character in T. If they match, increment k; otherwise, stay at the same state.

3. Update the result for each state based on the transition rules. This can be done recursively or iteratively using a loop.

4. Return the minimum length of the shortest uncommon subsequence found by iterating over all possible states (i, k) in the dictionary.

Potential issues with the plan:

1. The plan does not handle edge cases such as empty strings S and/or T. These cases should be handled separately.

2. The plan assumes that the input strings are non-empty but does not explicitly check for this condition.

3. The plan can be improved by implementing a more efficient dynamic programming solution using bottom-up or top-down approaches, rather than relying on memoization.

4. The plan does not consider the scenario where no uncommon subsequence is possible between S and T. This should also be handled as an edge case.

Edge cases:
1. If both strings are empty, return -1 (no uncommon subsequences).
2. If one of the strings is empty, check if there are any characters in the other string.
   - If not, return 0 (there are no uncommon subsequences).
   - If there are some characters left in the non-empty string, return the length of those characters.

This plan should be a good starting point for solving this problem. However, it is essential to handle edge cases and consider potential issues when implementing the solution.
