===BEGIN PLAN===
Avoid overlapping subproblems by considering only unique prefixes in both strings.
Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary.

Defining the state as the length of the longest common subsequence found so far between prefixes of S and T.
Consider a state that represents the longest common subsequence ending at each position in both strings,
and use this to compute the transition relationship.

A recursive function with memoization using a dictionary where the state is represented by the current character in both strings.
