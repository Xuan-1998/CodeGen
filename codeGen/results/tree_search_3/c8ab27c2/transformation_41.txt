===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the longest common suffix (LCS) of two strings. Then, find the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence by subtracting the LCS from the lengths of S and T.

Define the state as a pair (length_S, length_T) that stores the lengths of strings S and T.
Let the state be (i, j) where i is the current position in string S and j is the current position in string T. The goal is to find the longest common suffix of S[:i] and T[:j].

**Issue:** What if we only consider the LCS of substrings up to length (i, j)? This might not give us the correct answer.

Instead, we could use dynamic programming to fill up a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] stores the length of the LCS of S[:i] and T[:j].

The base case is when i or j is 0, in which case the LCS is an empty string with length 0.
For other cells, we consider two possibilities: either the last characters of S[:i] and T[:j] are the same (in which case we move diagonally up), or they are different (in which case we take the maximum length of the LCS from the cell above).

Finally, return dp[m][n] where m and n are the lengths of strings S and T.

**Edge cases:** What if either string is empty? In this case, the LCS is an empty string with length 0. We should handle this edge case when filling up the table.
