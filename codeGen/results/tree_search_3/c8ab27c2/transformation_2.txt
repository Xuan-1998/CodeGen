===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify the subsequences of S and T that have common prefix. Use a hashmap to store the frequency of prefixes in both strings.

Define the state as a tuple (prefix, i) where prefix is the common prefix of S[:i] and T[:j]

Consider states as (i, j) representing the indices in strings S and T respectively. Transition from a state to another if the characters at positions i and j are equal.

Precompute all possible substrings of both strings using their suffix trees or Z-values, and then iterate through these substrings to find the shortest uncommon subsequence.
