Determine the longest common suffix (LCS) of two strings. Then, find the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence by subtracting the LCS from the lengths of S and T.

This approach looks correct! By finding the LCS, you're essentially finding the maximum prefix that is shared between both strings. Subtracting this from the lengths of S and T will give you the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence.

Define the state as a pair (length_S, length_T) that stores the lengths of strings S and T.

This is a good way to represent the dynamic programming states. You're essentially storing the lengths of the strings being considered at each step.

Consider a dynamic programming array dp with dimensions (length_S + 1) x (length_T + 1), where dp[i][j] represents the length of the LCS of the first i characters in S and the first j characters in T.

This is correct! The DP array should have dimensions that account for both strings. By using this array, you can store the lengths of LCS for previously computed subproblems and reuse them when needed.

Use memoization to store the lengths of LCS for previously computed subproblems and reuse them when needed.

This is a great idea! Memoization can help avoid redundant computation and improve the efficiency of your algorithm.

However, there's one potential issue that you might want to consider: what happens if S and T are very long? The DP array will be huge! You might need to optimize the space usage or use a more efficient data structure to store the states.

Edge cases:
- What if S and T are empty strings?
- What if one of the strings is an empty string?

These edge cases should be considered when implementing the plan. For example, you might want to handle these cases separately before entering the main loop of your algorithm.

Overall, this looks like a solid plan! Just keep in mind those potential issues and edge cases as you implement it.
