===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j) in the rectangle.
dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares required to tile the sub-rectangle from (0, 0) to (i, j).

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j) and use dynamic programming to fill in the values from top-down by recursively solving smaller subproblems.
