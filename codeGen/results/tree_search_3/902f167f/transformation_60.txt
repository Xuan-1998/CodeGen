===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved through tabulation by building the solution bottom-up from the base case, which would be a square with side length 1.
State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where i is the row index (0-indexed) and j is the column index (0-indexed). Base case: dp[0][j] = 1 for all j because a single row can be tiled with one square.
dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x (j+1), considering all possible rectangles of size k x (j+1) with 0 <= k <= i.
Initialize dp[0][j] to 1 for all j, as mentioned in the state expression, since a single row can be tiled with one square.
