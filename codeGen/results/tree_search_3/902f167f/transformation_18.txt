===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

State Expression:
dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number})
representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j), where k and m are indices for the previous cells in the rectangle that can be used as the top-left corner of a square.

Transition Relationship:
Create a dictionary to store the minimum number of squares required to tile up to each cell, using the cell's coordinates as keys and its values being updated iteratively.

To improve this plan:

* Consider initializing dp with base cases (e.g., for cells at the edge of the rectangle) before iterating through the rest of the cells.
* Be mindful of corner cases where (i-k) * (j-m) is not a square number. In such cases, consider using a separate variable to store the minimum number of squares required to tile up to that point.
* Edge cases: The plan does not explicitly handle edge cases where k or m might exceed i or j. You should add checks for these cases and update dp accordingly.

Overall, your approach seems correct, but some additional considerations need to be made to ensure correctness. Keep it up!
