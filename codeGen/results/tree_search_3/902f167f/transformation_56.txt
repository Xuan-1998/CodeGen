Your initial plan shows a good understanding of the problem's dynamic programming nature.

The use of memoization to store intermediate results is a great idea, as it can significantly reduce the computational complexity. 

Defining the state as (i, j) makes sense, as you are essentially keeping track of the current position in the rectangle and whether or not you've placed a square there yet.

However, I would suggest refining your plan by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems. For example:

* How do you determine if a particular square can be placed at a given position (i, j)?
* What is the minimum number of squares required to tile the remaining rectangle after placing a square at position (i, j)?

You might want to consider using a bottom-up approach where you start by solving smaller subproblems and then combining them to get your final answer.

It would also be helpful to explicitly define the base case for when the remaining rectangle has a size of 0x0. This will help ensure that your dynamic programming solution handles edge cases correctly.

Finally, I would recommend considering the constraints on n and m (between 1 and 13 inclusive) and how they might affect your approach.
