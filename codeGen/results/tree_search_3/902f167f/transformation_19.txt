===BEGIN PLAN REVISION===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

State Expression:
dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number}) 
representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j), where k and m are indices for the previous cells in the rectangle that can be used as the top-left corner of a square.

Transition Relationship:
Define a recursive function that calculates the minimum number of squares required to tile up to each cell. For each cell (i, j), consider all possible top-left corners (k, m) where k < i and m < j. If (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number, then the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j) is dp[k][m] + 1.

Base Cases:
Handle the edges of the rectangle by setting dp[i][0] = dp[0][j] = 0 for all i and j. This is because there are no squares that can be placed on the edges.

Improvements:
To improve the plan, consider pre-computing all square numbers up to a certain maximum value (e.g., sqrt(max(n*m))) and storing them in an array or set. This would allow for constant-time lookups instead of recalculating square numbers at each step.
Potential Issues:
1. The plan does not handle the case where no squares can be placed to tile up to cell (i, j). In this case, dp[i][j] should be set to infinity or a very large value.
2. The plan assumes that the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j) is always equal to 1 plus the minimum number of squares required to tile up to some previous cell (k, m). However, this may not always be the case.

Edge Cases:
1. The base cases for the edges should handle the case where i or j is 0.
2. If n or m is 1, then the rectangle can only be tiled with squares of size 1x1. In this case, dp[i][j] should be set to the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j) based on whether i or j is greater.

Note: The plan has not been fully implemented yet and requires further refinement.
