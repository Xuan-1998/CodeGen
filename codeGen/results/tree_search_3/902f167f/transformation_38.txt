===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number}) representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j), where k and m are indices for the previous cells in the rectangle that can be used as the top-left corner of a square.

This looks correct! You're treating each cell as a subproblem and defining the state expression correctly. The use of dynamic programming is also a good approach for this problem.

dp[i][j] = min({dp[k+1][j] + 1 | k < i-1 and j > 0 and (i-k-1)*j is a square number})

This recursive formula looks correct as well! You're considering all possible previous cells that can be used as the top-left corner of a square, and calculating the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j).

Implement memoization using a dictionary where the key is the cell coordinates and the value is the minimum number of squares required to tile up to that point.

This is also correct! Using memoization can help avoid redundant calculations and improve the efficiency of the dynamic programming approach.
