===BEGIN PLAN UPDATE AND ANALYSIS===
The initial plan shows good intuition on using dynamic programming to solve this problem. Here's an updated and analyzed plan:

Consider using memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

* This is a great idea, as we can cache the minimum number of squares required to tile each sub-rectangle, reducing the time complexity.
Define the state as (i, j), where i represents the current row index and j represents the current column index, and the base case is when the remaining rectangle has a size of 0x0.

* This choice of state representation makes sense, as we need to keep track of the sub-rectangle's dimensions.
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where the state represents the minimum number of squares required to tile a sub-rectangle with dimensions i x j, for 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= m.

* This is correct. We'll build up the solution by solving smaller problems first, which will help us avoid redundant calculations.
You can implement memoization using a recursive function with a dictionary-based cache.

* This is one way to implement memoization. Another approach would be to use dynamic programming tables or arrays.

To further improve this plan:

1. **Edge cases**: Make sure to handle edge cases like n=0, m=0, and n=m=0 separately, as the base case will not cover these scenarios.
2. **Recursion vs Iteration**: Consider using a combination of recursion and iteration for the dynamic programming approach, depending on the specific implementation.

Overall, this plan provides a good foundation for solving the problem. It's essential to handle edge cases and optimize the solution further based on the chosen implementation details.
