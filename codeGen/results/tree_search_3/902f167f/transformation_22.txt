===BEGIN FEEDBACK===
Your plan shows great insight into applying dynamic programming to solve this problem. It correctly identifies that each cell can be treated as a subproblem, and the state expression dp[i][j] is well-defined.

However, there are a few potential issues with the plan:

* The recursive function is not clearly defined. How would you calculate dp[k][m] in terms of dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], or other values? This needs to be clarified.
* The iterative solution is also missing. While it's great that you're planning for both approaches, the iterative solution should also be well-defined.

To improve the plan:

* Clarify how the recursive function would work. You might need to add more base cases or intermediate steps to make the recursion more explicit.
* Add a clear outline of how the iterative solution would work. This could involve initializing a 2D array and filling it up iteratively, using the previously calculated values.

As for edge cases, you've got some good ideas there! You might want to consider adding more base cases or special handling for the edges (e.g., when i=1 or j=1).

Here's an updated version of your plan:
