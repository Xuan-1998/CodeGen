===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j) in the rectangle.

However, it's not entirely correct to define dp[i][j] as the sum of the minimum number of squares required to tile the top left sub-rectangle, right side sub-rectangle, and bottom sub-rectangle. This is because each square can only be used once to tile a cell.

A more accurate state expression would be: dp[i][j] is the minimum number of squares with sides less than or equal to min(i, j) that are required to tile up to cell (i, j).

The recurrence relation can then be defined as: 
dp[i][j] = 1 + min({dp[k-1][j] | k=1 to i}) if i > 0
or dp[i][j] = 1 + min({dp[i][k-1] | k=1 to j}) if j > 0

This is because a square with side length x can only be placed in cells (i, j) where i >= x and j >= x.

To improve the plan, consider initializing the dp array with values representing the base case: no squares are needed to tile up to cell (0, 0).

Potential issues with the plan include:
* The recurrence relation assumes that a square can be placed in any cell, but this is not true. A square can only be placed in cells where its sides fit.
* There may be edge cases that need to be handled separately, such as what if n or m is 0?

The plan should be modified to account for these issues and include proper initialization of the dp array and handling of edge cases.
