===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved through tabulation by building the solution bottom-up from the base case, which would be a square with side length 1.

State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where i is the row index (0-indexed) and j is the column index (0-indexed). Base case: dp[0][j] = 1 for all j because a single row can be tiled with one square.

The plan seems correct so far. However, to make it more precise, we should also consider the base case where i=0 or j=0. In this case, we need to tile an empty rectangle (i.e., no rectangle), which requires 0 squares.

dp[i][j] is minimized by considering all possible rectangles of size k x j with 0 <= k <= i-1 and adding the minimum number of squares required to tile that rectangle to 1 if i-k > 0 or j-k > 0. This is because we can either use a square of side length i-k or j-k, or consider smaller sub-problems.

Initialize the base case: dp[0][j] = 1 for all j. Then fill in the rest of the table using a loop that iterates over each cell dp[i][j].

To make the plan more concrete, we can specify the range of k values to consider when calculating dp[i][j]. For example, we can iterate over k from 0 to i-1 and then from 0 to j-1.

The plan seems to be considering all possible edge cases. However, it's always a good idea to double-check that you're handling all the possible inputs correctly.
