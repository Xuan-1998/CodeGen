===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved through tabulation by building the solution bottom-up from the base case, which would be a square with side length 1.

State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where i is the row index and j is the column index. Base case: dp[i][0] = 1 for all i because a single column can be tiled with one square.

The recurrence relation:
dp[i][j] = min( 
    (1 + dp[min(i,j)-1][min(i,j)-1]) if i > 0 and j > 0 else
    (i == 0 or j == 0) 
)

This is because the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j can be achieved by either:

* Taking the minimum number of squares required to tile a smaller rectangle of size min(i,j)-1 x min(i,j)-1 and adding one more square on top or to the side
* Leaving a gap in one dimension (i.e., i == 0 or j == 0) because we can place a single square that covers the entire row or column

Employ memoization using a dictionary where the key is the state (i, j) and the value is the minimum number of squares required to tile that rectangle.

This plan takes into account edge cases such as when i or j is 0, and it includes the base case when i == 0 or j == 0. The potential issues with this plan are related to handling the boundary conditions correctly, which seem to be handled properly in the recurrence relation.
