===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved through tabulation by building the solution bottom-up from the base case, which would be a square with side length 1.

State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where (i, j) represents the current position in the rectangle and dp[k][l] is the minimum number of squares required to tile the sub-rectangle of size k x l. Base case: dp[0][j] or dp[i][0] because a single row or column can be tiled with one square.

dp[i][j] = 
  - dp[i][j-1] if j > 0 and max(i, j) % (i or j) == 0 // This condition seems correct. If the current rectangle's side length is divisible by the previous row/column's side length, then we can simply copy the previous row/column.
  - min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) if i > 0 and j > 0 // This condition also looks good. We have two options: either copy the top part or the left part of the current rectangle, so we take the minimum of these two.
  - 1 if i == 0 or j == 0 // The base case where one of the dimensions is zero.
  - float('inf') else // Default case when none of the above conditions are met.
