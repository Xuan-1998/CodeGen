===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

Define the state expression as dp[(n-1)*(m-1)-i-j], where i and j are indices for the remaining cells in the rectangle, and dp is a 2D array with dimensions equal to the number of remaining cells. This can be considered as a top-down approach.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares needed to tile up to cell (i, j), considering all possible ways to place a square at that position.

Applying dynamic programming by creating a dictionary dp where the keys are tuples of (i, j) and values are the minimum number of squares needed to tile up to cell (i, j).

However, there is an issue with this plan. The state expression dp[(n-1)*(m-1)-i-j] does not seem to take into account the actual size of the remaining rectangle at each step.

A more accurate approach would be to consider all possible ways to place a square of side length 1 up to cell (i, j), and then recursively calculate the minimum number of squares needed to tile the remaining cells.

This can be achieved by defining dp[i][j] as the minimum number of squares needed to tile the top-left i-xm-j rectangle, considering all possible ways to place a square at position (i, j).

The dictionary dp can still be used, but with keys and values representing the state expression dp[i][j], where i and j are indices for the remaining cells in the rectangle.

To improve this plan, it would be beneficial to add base cases to handle edge cases, such as when there are no more cells left to tile (i.e., i=0 or j=0), or when the entire rectangle has been tiled (i.e., i=n-1 and j=m-1).

Overall, this dynamic programming approach seems correct, but it needs to be refined to accurately calculate the minimum number of squares needed to tile the given rectangle.
