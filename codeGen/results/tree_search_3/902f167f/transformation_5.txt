The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.
The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j) in the rectangle.
dp[i][j] is equal to 1 if cell (i, j) can be tiled by a single square. Otherwise, it's the minimum value between dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1] plus 1.
Utilize the concept of 'prefix sum' to calculate the minimum number of squares required to tile up to each cell.
