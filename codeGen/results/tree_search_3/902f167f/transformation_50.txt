===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state as dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile the first i rows and j columns of the original rectangle, and the base case is when i or j is 0. This approach allows us to break down the problem into smaller subproblems.

dp[i][j] can be calculated as the minimum of two cases: (1) placing a square of side length max(min(i, j), 1) and then tiling the remaining area, or (2) not placing any squares in this row and tiling the rest of the rectangle. In either case, dp[i-1][j-1] is the state for the remaining area.

Use a dictionary to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations with memoization. This approach can significantly reduce the time complexity by avoiding repeated calculations.

The plan seems correct, but it's worth noting that the base case should be when i or j is 0, not when both are 0.

To further improve the plan, consider handling edge cases where i or j (or both) equals to 1. In these cases, the minimum number of squares required would be different from the general case.

The plan does include edge cases where i or j (or both) equals to 1, as it considers placing a square of side length max(min(i, j), 1) in this case.

Overall, the plan seems correct and can be used as a starting point for implementing the solution. However, it's always important to consider edge cases and potential issues with the approach.
