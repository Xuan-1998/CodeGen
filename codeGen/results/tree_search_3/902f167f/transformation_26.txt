===BEGIN PLAN REVISION===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m-1] + 1 | k < i and m > 0 and (i-k)*m is a square number}) representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j), where k and m are indices for the previous cells in the rectangle that can be used as the top-left corner of a square.

To improve the plan, it's crucial to consider edge cases and handle them correctly. For instance, when i or j is 0, there's no need to calculate anything since the rectangle would not be fully filled with squares. Therefore, the base case should be handled separately.

Another potential issue is that the state expression doesn't account for squares of size larger than 1. This can be resolved by including a nested loop that checks all possible square sizes and their orientations (horizontal or vertical).

The revised plan includes edge cases and handles them correctly:
