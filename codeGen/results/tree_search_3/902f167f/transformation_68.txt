===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved through tabulation by building the solution bottom-up from the base case, which would be a square with side length 1.

State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where i is the row index and j is the column index. Base case: dp[i][0] = 1 for all i because a single column can be tiled with one square.
dp[i][j] = min( 1 + dp[i-1][j-1] if i > 0 and j > 0 else (i == 0 or j == 0) )
Store intermediate results in a table or array, then look up these values as needed instead of recalculating them, reducing computational time.
