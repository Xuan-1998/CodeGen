===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved through tabulation by building the solution bottom-up from the base case, which would be a square with side length 1.

State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where i is the row index (0-indexed) and j is the column index (0-indexed). Base case: dp[0][j] = 1 for all j because a single row can be tiled with one square.

The recursive formula for calculating dp[i][j] looks correct. It's considering the minimum number of squares required to tile the top part of the rectangle and the right part of the rectangle, and combining them in a way that makes sense.

Implement memoization by creating a dictionary memo that maps each state to its corresponding value, then use this memo to store and reuse intermediate results during the computation. This is a good idea because the problem seems to have overlapping subproblems, which would lead to inefficient computation without memoization.

However, I think there's one potential issue with the plan: it doesn't handle the edge cases where i or j (or both) are 1. In this case, we don't need any squares at all! So, we should add a special case for these edge cases and return 0 in those situations.

Also, I think it would be helpful to add some checks at the beginning of the computation to make sure that i and j are within the valid range (1-13). If they're not, we can just return an error message or something.

Overall, your plan looks good! With a little bit of tweaking to handle edge cases and add error checking, it should be ready for implementation.
