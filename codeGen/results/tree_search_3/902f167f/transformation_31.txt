===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number}) representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j), where k and m are indices for the previous cells in the rectangle that can be used as the top-left corner of a square.

The minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j) depends on the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cells (k, m-1), where (i-k)*m is a square number. This approach might not consider all possible combinations of squares that can be used to tile the rectangle.

To improve this plan, it's better to think about how you can combine smaller squares to form larger ones and use this property to reduce the number of recursive calls. You could also use memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

One potential issue with this plan is that it might not work well for large inputs because it has a high time complexity due to the recursive nature of the problem. It's also important to consider edge cases, such as what happens when i or j is 1?

To include edge cases, you could add some base cases to your dynamic programming approach. For example, if i is 1 or j is 1, then dp[i][j] would be 0 because a single square can always tile the rectangle.
