===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

Define the state expression as dp[(n-1)*(m-1)-i-j], where i and j are indices for the remaining cells in the rectangle, and dp is a 2D array with dimensions equal to the number of remaining cells. This can be considered as a top-down approach.

dp[(n-1)*(m-1)-i-j] = min(dp[(n-1)*(m-1)-(k-1)-j] + dp[(n-1)*(m-1)-(i-1)-(l-1)] for k in range(1, i+1) for l in range(1, j+1))

Create a 2D array dp of size (n* m - n - m + 1) x (n*m - n - m + 1), and fill it with the minimum number of squares required to tile each sub-rectangle.
