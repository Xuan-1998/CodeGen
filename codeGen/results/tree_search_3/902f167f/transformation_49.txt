===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state as dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile the first i rows and j columns of the original rectangle, and the base case is when i or j is 0.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1 if i > 0 and j > 0

Employ a recursive function with memoization to avoid redundant calculations and store previously computed results.
===END PLAN===

Feedback:

* The plan is correct in the sense that it's a good starting point. You're right to consider using memoization to avoid redundant calculations, as this problem has overlapping subproblems.
* One potential issue with the plan is that you're not considering the possibility of a square being placed diagonally. In particular, when i > 0 and j > 0, you might want to consider the minimum number of squares required to tile the first i-1 rows and j-1 columns, rather than just the minimum number of squares required to tile the top-left i x j subrectangle.
* Another potential issue is that your base case only considers when i or j is 0. You should also consider the case where both i and j are 0 (i.e., the original rectangle is a single square).
* To improve the plan, you could add more cases to handle the different ways a square can be placed within the rectangle. For example, you might want to consider placing a square at the top-left corner of the rectangle, or at the bottom-right corner.
* Edge cases: You should test your code with edge cases such as n=1 and m=1 (i.e., a single square), n=2 and m=2 (i.e., two squares side by side), etc.
