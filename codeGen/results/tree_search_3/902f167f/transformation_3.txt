===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j) in the rectangle.

dp[i][j] is equal to 1 if cell (i, j) can be tiled by a single square. Otherwise, it's the minimum value between dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1] plus 1.

However, this plan does not consider the constraint that n and m are integers between 1 and 13 inclusive. This constraint could be important to ensure the correctness of the solution.

Also, there is no consideration for edge cases such as when i or j is equal to 0 (i.e., when we're considering the first row or column).

To improve this plan, consider adding constraints for n and m, and handling edge cases. This could involve initializing dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] separately.

Here's an updated version of your plan:
