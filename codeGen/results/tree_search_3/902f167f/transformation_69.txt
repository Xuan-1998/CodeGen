===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved through tabulation by building the solution bottom-up from the base case, which would be a square with side length 1.

State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where i is the row index and j is the column index. Base case: dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 1 for all i because a single column or row can be tiled with one square.

Transition rule: dp[i][j] = min( dp[i-1][j] + (i/j) , dp[i][j-1] + (j/i) ) for all i and j, where (i/j) represents the number of squares that can fit in the i-th row with a side length of j. This transition rule takes into account the possibility of using larger squares to cover the remaining area.

Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j.

Base case: Initialize the first row and column with values of 1, as a single column or row can be tiled with one square.

Fill in the table by iterating through each cell from top-left to bottom-right. For each cell dp[i][j], calculate the minimum number of squares required using the transition rule, and update the value accordingly.

The solution is then the value stored in the last cell of the table, which corresponds to the minimum number of squares required to tile the original rectangle.
