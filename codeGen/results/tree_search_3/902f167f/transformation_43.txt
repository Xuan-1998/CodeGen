===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state as (i, j), where i represents the current row index and j represents the current column index, and the base case is when the remaining rectangle has a size of 0x0.

Formulate state as dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile the rectangle from (0,0) to (i,j), and use the recurrence relation: 
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1 if i > 0 or j > 0, else 0.

Implement tabulation or memoization.
