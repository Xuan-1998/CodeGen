===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number}) representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j), where k and m are indices for the previous cells in the rectangle that can be used as the top-left corner of a square.

The minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j) depends on the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cells (k, m-1), where (i-k)*m is a square number. This dependency is correct and shows that you are thinking in terms of recursive relationships between subproblems.

Implement tabulation using a 2D array where each cell dp[i][j] is initialized with a large value and updated as you iterate through the cells in the rectangle.

Feedback:
The plan looks good! You have correctly identified the problem as a dynamic programming problem, defined the state expression correctly, and shown how the subproblems are dependent on each other. Your idea of using tabulation is also correct. However, there are a few things you can improve:

1. Clarify what you mean by "large value" when initializing dp[i][j]. Are you saying that all values in dp should be initialized to infinity? If so, then it would be helpful to explain why.

2. It might be helpful to explicitly mention how the base case for the recursion will work. For example, how do you handle the case where (i-k)*m is not a square number?

3. The plan does not seem to account for edge cases. What if n or m is 1? How would that affect your dynamic programming approach? You might want to add some sentences explaining how you will handle these edge cases.

4. Finally, it would be helpful to explain why the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j) depends on the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cells (k, m-1). What property of the problem does this dependency rely on? Explaining this could make your plan more understandable and persuasive.
