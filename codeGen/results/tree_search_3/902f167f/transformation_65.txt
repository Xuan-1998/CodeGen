The overall approach is correct - using dynamic programming with tabulation to build the solution bottom-up from the base case.

State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where i is the row index (0-indexed) and j is the column index (0-indexed).

Base case: dp[0][j] = 1 for all j because a single row can be tiled with one square. This is correct.

The recursive formula to compute dp[i][j] is also correct: considering all possible rectangles of size k x j with 0 <= k <= i-1 and adding the minimum number of squares required to tile that rectangle to 1 if i-k > 0 or j-k > 0. This takes into account the possibility of tiling a sub-rectangle with smaller squares.

However, there's a minor improvement we can make: instead of considering all possible rectangles of size k x j with 0 <= k <= i-1, we can optimize this by only considering the maximum possible value of k, which is i. This reduces the number of states to consider and makes the algorithm more efficient.

To store the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j, you proposed using a dictionary memo. This is also correct - using a memoization table to avoid recomputing the same values multiple times can significantly improve the performance of the algorithm.

In terms of edge cases, your plan correctly considers the base case where dp[0][j] = 1 for all j. However, we should also consider the edge case where i = m or j = n, which would correspond to a single square that tiles the entire rectangle. In this case, the minimum number of squares required is simply 1.

Overall, your plan is correct and can be improved by optimizing the recursive formula and using memoization to store the values. The only edge cases to consider are the base case where dp[0][j] = 1 for all j and the edge case where i = m or j = n.
