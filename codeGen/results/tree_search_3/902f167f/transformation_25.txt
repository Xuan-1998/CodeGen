===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number}) representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j), where k and m are indices for the previous cells in the rectangle that can be used as the top-left corner of a square.

State:
1. Initialize dp array with dimensions n x m, filled with infinity values.
2. For each cell (i, j) in the rectangle:
   - If i == 0 or j == 0, return 0 because a single square can tile the entire row or column.
   - Otherwise, calculate the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i-1, j-1) by considering all possible top-left corners for a square that can be placed in this cell.
   - For each possible top-left corner (k, m):
     - If (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number and dp[k][m] has already been calculated, add 1 to the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i-1, j-1).
     - Update dp[i][j] with the minimum value.
3. Return dp[n-1][m-1], which represents the minimum number of squares required to tile the entire rectangle.

Potential issues with the plan:
- The state expression assumes that a square can be placed at any cell (i, j) in the rectangle, but this might not always be possible due to constraints on the size and position of the squares.
- The plan does not explicitly handle edge cases such as when i or j is 0.

To improve the plan:
- Add explicit handling for edge cases by modifying the state expression and state transitions accordingly.
- Consider using memoization instead of dynamic programming if the problem can be solved using a bottom-up approach.
