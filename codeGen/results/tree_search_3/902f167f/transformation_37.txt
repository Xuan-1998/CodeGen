===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number}) representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j), where k and m are indices for the previous cells in the rectangle that can be used as the top-left corner of a square.

However, this initial plan has some issues:

1. The state expression is too complex and might lead to incorrect results due to the recursive nature.
2. It does not consider the fact that we need to tile the entire rectangle, not just a specific cell.

To improve the plan, let's simplify the problem by focusing on one dimension at a time (either horizontally or vertically). We can use dynamic programming to find the minimum number of squares needed to tile each row or column separately. This will reduce the state space and make the problem more manageable.

Here's an updated plan:

===UPDATE PLAN===
Let's define dp[i] as the minimum number of squares required to tile the first i columns, and dp[j] as the minimum number of squares required to tile the first j rows.

The base case is when only one square is needed (i.e., i = 1 or j = 1). In this case, dp[i] = dp[j] = 1.

For larger values of i and j, we can use the following recursive formula:

dp[i] = min({dp[k] + 1 | k < i and (i-k) is a square number})

dp[j] = min({dp[m] + 1 | m < j and (j-m) is a square number})

Finally, the minimum number of squares required to tile the entire rectangle is dp[n] * dp[m].

This plan should be more accurate and easier to implement. It still has potential issues with edge cases, but they can be handled by considering the constraints given in the problem statement.
