===BEGIN PLAN UPDATE===
Consider using memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
Define the state as dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile the first i rows and j columns of the original rectangle, and the base case is when i or j is 0.

However, we need to consider the following: what if there are multiple possible ways to tile the same sub-rectangle? We would want to choose the one with the minimum number of squares. 

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1 if i > 0 and j > 0

But wait, what about cases where we can't tile the entire rectangle? For instance, if n or m is odd, we might not be able to tile it with integer-sided squares. We should handle these edge cases.

Let's also consider how we would initialize dp[i][j] for i or j equal to 0. It seems reasonable that dp[0][j] = 1 and dp[i][0] = 1, since a single column or row can be tiled with one square.

Finally, let's not forget about the constraints: n and m are integers between 1 and 13 inclusive. This might affect our solution in some way, perhaps by limiting the range of values we need to consider.
