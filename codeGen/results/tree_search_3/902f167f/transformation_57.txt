===BEGIN FEEDBACK===
Your plan seems to be heading in the right direction, especially with the consideration of memoization to avoid redundant calculations. However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:
1. Instead of using a 3-state system (i, j, k), consider reducing it to a 2-state system (i, j). The boolean value k might not be necessary, as you can always determine whether the last square was placed horizontally or vertically based on the size of the remaining rectangle.
2. In your memoization approach, instead of storing all possible intermediate results in a dictionary, consider using dynamic programming to construct the solution in a bottom-up manner. This will avoid storing redundant information and reduce memory usage.
3. Edge cases: Make sure to handle edge cases such as when n or m is 0 (empty rectangle) or when the remaining rectangle has an odd size (impossible to tile with integer-sided squares). These should be considered separately from the main logic.

Here's an updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to construct the solution in a bottom-up manner.
Define the state as (i, j), where i represents the current row index and j represents the current column index, and the base case is when the remaining rectangle has a size of 0x0.
Implement memoization to store intermediate results for subproblems using dynamic programming, without storing redundant information in memory.
Handle edge cases: 
- If n or m is 0 (empty rectangle), return 0 as it's impossible to tile with integer-sided squares.
- If the remaining rectangle has an odd size, return -1 (or any other error value) as it's also impossible to tile.

===END UPDATED PLAN===
