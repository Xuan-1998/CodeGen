===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state as (i, j), where i represents the current row index and j represents the current column index, and the base case is when the remaining rectangle has a size of 0x0.

Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where the state represents the minimum number of squares required to tile a sub-rectangle with dimensions i x j, for 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= m.

You can define a 2D array dp with dimensions n+1 x m+1, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares required to tile a sub-rectangle of size i x j.

**Initial Thoughts:**
Your plan looks solid! Memoization is a great approach for avoiding redundant calculations in dynamic programming problems. The state definition and base case are also well-defined. The bottom-up approach with a 2D array dp seems like a good choice as well.

**Potential Issues:**
One potential issue I see is that you may need to consider edge cases where i or j (or both) are equal to 1. In these cases, the minimum number of squares required might be different from the general case.

**Edge Cases:**
You should also consider handling edge cases such as when n or m is 0 or 1. For instance, if n or m is 1, then you only need one square to tile the rectangle.
