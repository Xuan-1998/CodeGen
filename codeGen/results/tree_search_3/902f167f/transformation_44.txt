===BEGIN PLAN UPDATE===
Consider using memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations. This is a good approach, as the problem requires you to find the minimum number of integer-sided squares that tile the given rectangle. Memoization can help you avoid recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.

Define the state as (i, j), where i represents the current row index and j represents the current column index, and the base case is when the remaining rectangle has a size of 0x0. This is a good starting point, but it might be more intuitive to define the state as (n-i, m-j) instead, representing the remaining height and width of the rectangle.

Define state as dp[(n, m)] where n is the remaining row height and m is the remaining column width. Transition from one state to another by updating the state when a square is placed at the bottom or right edge of the rectangle. This makes sense, as you would be considering the different possibilities for the last square that can fit in the remaining rectangle.

Use a dictionary to store intermediate results, where the key is the current state and the value is the minimum number of squares required. This is also a good approach, as it allows you to avoid recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.

===END PLAN UPDATE===

Potential issues with the plan include:
* Edge cases: What happens when n or m is 1? You would need to handle these cases separately.
* Overlapping states: Since you are considering all possible squares that can fit in the remaining rectangle, there might be overlapping states. For example, if a square of size (x, y) fits at the bottom edge of the rectangle, it also means that a square of size (x-1, y) or (x, y-1) could have fitted earlier. You would need to handle this by considering only the smallest possible squares.
* Base case: The base case is when the remaining rectangle has a size of 0x0. What happens if n or m is 1? You would need to handle these cases separately.

Overall, the plan looks good and can be improved upon by handling edge cases and overlapping states. It also provides a good starting point for implementing the dynamic programming solution.
