===BEGIN PLAN UPDATE===
The initial plan is correct, but there's room for improvement.

State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where i is the row index and j is the column index. Base case: dp[i][0] = 1 for all i because a single column can be tiled with one square.
dp[i][j] = min( 
    (i > 0 and j > 0) ? 1 + dp[i-1][j-1] : 
    (i == 0 or j == 0) ? 1 : 
    Infinity
) for all i and j.

To make the plan more efficient, consider initializing the base case as dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 0 for all i and j because an empty rectangle can be tiled with zero squares.
The recursive formula should also consider the cases where i or j is less than 2, in which case the minimum number of squares required to tile the sub-rectangle is simply 1.

The plan includes edge cases by considering the base cases dp[i][0] and dp[0][j].
