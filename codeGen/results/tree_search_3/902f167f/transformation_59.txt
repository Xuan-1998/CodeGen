===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved through tabulation by building the solution bottom-up from the base case, which would be a square with side length 1.

State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where i is the row index (0-indexed) and j is the column index (0-indexed). Base case: dp[0][j] = 1 for all j because a single row can be tiled with one square.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x (j+1), considering all possible rectangles of size k x (j+1) with 0 <= k <= i. This means we need to consider all possible ways to tile the top i-1 rows, and then find the smallest number of squares that can cover the remaining j+1 columns.

Use dynamic programming by filling up the dp table in a bottom-up manner, starting from the base case and working your way up to the original problem dimensions. This would involve iterating over each cell (i, j) in the dp table, considering all possible values of k such that 0 <= k <= i, and updating dp[i][j] based on whether it's more efficient to tile the top i-1 rows with k squares or not.

This plan seems correct, but it might be improved by considering some edge cases. For example, when i is very small compared to j, we can ignore the first few columns of the rectangle and focus only on the last column that remains untiled. This would reduce the number of possible values for k and make the computation more efficient.

The plan does not explicitly consider edge cases, but by using dynamic programming, it will automatically handle the base case (i.e., when i is 0) correctly. However, we should make sure to handle the cases where j is 0 or very small properly.

One potential issue with this plan is that it assumes the problem constraints are correct and does not consider any possible invalid inputs. We should add some error checking code to ensure that the input values for n and m are within the allowed range.

Overall, this plan looks like a good starting point for solving the problem, but we need to refine it further by handling edge cases and potential issues.
