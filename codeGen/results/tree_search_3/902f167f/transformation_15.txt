===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

Define the state expression as dp[(n-1)*(m-1)-i- j], where i and j are indices for the remaining cells in the rectangle, and dp is a 2D array with dimensions equal to the number of remaining cells. This can be considered as a top-down approach.

dp[(n-1)*(m-1)-i-j] = min(dp[(n-1)*(m-1)-(k-1)-j] + dp[(n-1)*(m-1)-(i-1)-(l-1)] for k in range(i) for l in range(j))
