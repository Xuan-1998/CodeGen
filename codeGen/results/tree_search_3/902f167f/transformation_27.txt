===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number}) 
representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j), where k and m are indices for the previous cells in the rectangle that can be used as the top-left corner of a square.

The base case should be set to dp[0][m] = 1 and dp[i][0] = 1, representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up a row or column of length i or m respectively.

A hash table can be used to store previously calculated values and avoid redundant computation.

To calculate the value for a cell (i, j), iterate over all possible values of k and m such that k < i and m < j and check if (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number. If it is, then add 1 to the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (k, m-1) or (k-1, m), whichever is smaller.

The final answer can be calculated by returning dp[n-1][m-1].
