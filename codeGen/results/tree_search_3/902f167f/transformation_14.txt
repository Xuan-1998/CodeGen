===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
Define a 2D array dp with dimensions (n-1)*(m-1) to store the minimum number of squares required to tile up to each cell in the rectangle.
For each cell (i, j), consider all possible integer-sided squares that can cover it. These are the squares with side lengths ranging from 1 to min(i+1, j+1).
Choose the square that minimizes the total number of squares required to tile the remaining cells.
The base case is when i or j is 0, in which case the answer is 0.

For each cell (i, j), calculate dp[i][j] as:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j] + dp[i-l][l] for k in range(max(1, i+1-j), i+1) for l in range(max(1, j+1-i), j+1))
