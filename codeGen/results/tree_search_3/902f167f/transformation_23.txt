===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number}) representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j), where k and m are indices for the previous cells in the rectangle that can be used as the top-left corner of a square.

State
Create a bottom-up dynamic programming table using a 2D array and iterate over the cells in a row-major order to fill up the values.

The plan seems correct so far. However, there's one potential issue: the state expression is not entirely clear. The condition (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number may not always lead to the optimal solution. 

To improve this plan, consider defining the state more carefully. For example, you could define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of squares required to tile the top-left (0, 0) to cell (i, j).

One edge case that should be considered is when i or j is equal to 1. In this case, there are no cells above or to the left, so you can simply return 0.

Another edge case is when n and m are both 1. In this case, you need to tile a single cell, which requires 0 squares.

The plan should be wrapped around these edge cases and state definition improvements.
