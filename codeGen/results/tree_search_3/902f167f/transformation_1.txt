===BEGIN FEEDBACK===
The overall approach you've outlined is correct, as you're planning to use dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem. Here are some specific thoughts on each step:

* Treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem: This makes sense, as we want to break down the problem into smaller pieces that can be solved recursively.
* Defining the state expression dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j): This looks good! It's a natural way to think about the problem.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

* Edge cases: Make sure you consider what happens when i or j is 0. In this case, dp[i][j] would be 0, as there are no squares that need to be tiled.
* Base cases: You might want to think about what base cases you can use to kickstart the recursion. For example, if both n and m are small enough, you could solve the problem directly.

In terms of potential issues:

* Overlapping subproblems: With dynamic programming, one common issue is that you end up solving the same subproblem multiple times. Make sure you're using memoization effectively to avoid this!

Overall, your plan looks solid, but it's always good to double-check and consider edge cases and base cases.
