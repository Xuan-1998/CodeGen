===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved through tabulation by building the solution bottom-up from the base case, which would be a square with side length 1.

State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where (i, j) represents the current position in the rectangle and dp[k][l] is the minimum number of squares required to tile the sub-rectangle of size k x l. Base case: dp[0][j] or dp[i][0] because a single row or column can be tiled with one square.

dp[i][j] = ?

The current state expression only considers the base case, which is not sufficient to solve the problem. We need to consider how the minimum number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j depends on the minimum number of squares required to tile the sub-rectangle of size k x l.

A possible improvement could be to add another state expression that considers the minimum number of squares required to tile the sub-rectangle of size k x l, where k and l are the side lengths of a square that can fit entirely within the current rectangle. This would involve checking all possible values of k and l that satisfy the condition.

However, there's an issue with this plan: what if no square can fit entirely within the current rectangle? In this case, we need to consider other possibilities for tiling the rectangle, such as breaking it into smaller rectangles or using a combination of squares and rectangles. The base case should also be revised to handle this scenario.

Edge cases:
1. What happens when n = 0 or m = 0? Should the function return an error or a default value?
2. How do we handle the case where no square can fit entirely within the current rectangle?

Overall, your plan is on the right track, but it needs more development to consider all possible scenarios and edge cases.
