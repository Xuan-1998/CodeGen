Your plan looks good overall, but I have some minor suggestions to improve it.

Firstly, you're correct that this problem can be solved using dynamic programming. Your idea of tabulation and building the solution bottom-up is a great approach.

The state expression you provided makes sense: dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j. The base case dp[0][j] = 1 for all j is also correct, as a single row can indeed be tiled with one square.

However, I think your explanation of how dp[i][j] is calculated could be improved. You mentioned considering all possible rectangles of size k x (j+1) with 0 <= k <= i, but it's not entirely clear what you mean by "considering". Could you elaborate on this step?

One potential issue with the plan is that you didn't explicitly handle the edge case where n or m is 0. In this case, the answer would be 0, since an empty rectangle requires no squares to tile.

Another minor suggestion I have is to consider how you'll initialize the dp array. You might want to set all initial values to infinity or some other "impossible" value, and then update them as you iterate through the DP table.

Overall, your plan looks solid, but a bit more clarity on the state transition and handling of edge cases would be helpful.
