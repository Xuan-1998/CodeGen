===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number}) representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j), where k and m are indices for the previous cells in the rectangle that can be used as the top-left corner of a square.

State
Initialize a 2D array dp with dimensions n+1 x m+1, where all elements are initialized to infinity. This ensures that any uncomputed subproblems will have a default value.

Then, set dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since no squares are needed to tile the first row.

Transition
For each cell (i, j), calculate the minimum number of squares required to tile up to that point by considering all possible previous cells (k, m) where k < i and m < j. If (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number, then it's possible to place a square on top of cell (k, m). The transition function can be defined as:

dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number})

Base Case
The base case for the recursion is when i or j reaches 0, at which point no more squares are needed to tile the remaining rows or columns.

Optimization
To optimize the computation of dp[i][j], we can use a bottom-up approach. Start by computing the minimum number of squares required to tile the first row (i.e., dp[1][j]) and then gradually move upwards, filling in the dp array cell-by-cell.

Edge Cases
The edge cases for this problem include:
- n or m being 0: In this case, no tiles are needed.
- n or m being 1: In this case, only one tile is needed.
- Both n and m being equal to each other: The minimum number of squares required in this case would be the square root of n.
