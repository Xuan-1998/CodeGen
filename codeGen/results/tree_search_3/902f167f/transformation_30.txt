===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

State Expression:
dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number})
representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j),
where k and m are indices for the previous cells in the rectangle that can be used as the top-left corner of a square.

Transition Relationship:
Use memoization to store the calculated values in a dictionary or cache, and retrieve them when needed.
