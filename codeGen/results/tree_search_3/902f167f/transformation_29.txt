===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number}) representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j), where k and m are indices for the previous cells in the rectangle that can be used as the top-left corner of a square.

**Step 1: Initialize dp array**
Initialize a 2D array dp of size n x m with all values set to infinity. This represents the minimum number of squares required to tile each cell, initially assuming it's not possible to tile any cells.

**Step 2: Base case - Single cells**
Set dp[0][j] = 1 and dp[i][0] = 1 for all i and j, as a single cell can always be tiled with one square (the cell itself).

**Step 3: Transition relationship**
For each cell (i, j), iterate over all possible top-left corners (k, m) such that k < i and m < j. If the area of the rectangle between cells (i, j) and (k, m) is a square number, update dp[i][j] to be the minimum value between its current value and dp[k][m] + 1.

**Step 4: Memoize**
Store the calculated values in dp array to avoid redundant calculations. This ensures that subproblems are solved only once.

**Step 5: Return answer**
Return dp[n-1][m-1], which represents the minimum number of squares required to tile the entire rectangle.
