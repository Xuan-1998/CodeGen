===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved through tabulation by building the solution bottom-up from the base case, which would be a square with side length 1.

State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where (i, j) represents the current position in the rectangle and dp[k][l] is the minimum number of squares required to tile the sub-rectangle of size k x l. Base case: dp[0][j] or dp[i][0] because a single row or column can be tiled with one square.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1 if i > 0 and j > 0

Memoization: Use a dictionary to store the minimum number of squares required for sub-rectangles, and update the values as you fill in the table.
