===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved through tabulation by building the solution bottom-up from the base case, which would be a square with side length 1.

State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where (i, j) represents the current position in the rectangle and dp[k][l] is the minimum number of squares required to tile the sub-rectangle of size k x l. Base case: dp[0][j] or dp[i][0] because a single row or column can be tiled with one square.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1 if i > 0 and j > 0
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] if i > 0 and max(i, j) % (i or j) == 0
Apply the concept of overlapping subproblems by using a set or list to store previously computed values and avoid redundant calculations

Note: The plan is almost correct! However, I would suggest adding an additional base case for when either i or j is equal to 1. This is because a single row or column can also be tiled with one square.

Additionally, you may want to consider handling the edge cases where n or m are less than 2. In this case, the minimum number of integer-sided squares required would be 0, as there are no valid tile combinations for these inputs.
