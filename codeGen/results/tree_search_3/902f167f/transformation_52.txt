===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state as dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile the first i rows and j columns of the original rectangle, and the base case is when i or j is 0.

dp[i][j] is the minimum of two cases: (1) placing a square of side length max(min(i, j), 1) and then tiling the remaining area, or (2) not placing any squares in this row and tiling the rest of the rectangle. In either case, dp[i-1][j-1] is the state for the remaining area.

This approach seems correct so far! To improve the plan, consider adding a check to ensure that the square placed in the first step actually fits in the remaining area. This can be done by checking if min(i, j) >= 1.

The plan does not explicitly handle edge cases such as when i or j is 0. However, since we defined the base case as when i or j is 0, this will implicitly handle these edge cases correctly.

Potential issues with the plan include:
- What if no squares can fit in the remaining area after placing a square? The current plan does not explicitly handle this scenario.
- How do we determine which of the two cases (1) and (2) leads to the minimum number of squares?
