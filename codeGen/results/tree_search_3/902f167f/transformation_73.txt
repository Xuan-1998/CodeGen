===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved through tabulation by building the solution bottom-up from the base case, which would be a square with side length 1.

State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where i is the row index and j is the column index. Base case: dp[i][0] = 1 for all i because a single column can be tiled with one square.

dp[i][j] = min( dp[k][k] + (i-k-1)*(j-k-1) for k in range(min(i,j)) )

Applying memoization by storing the computed values of dp[i][j] in a dictionary
