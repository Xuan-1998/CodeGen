===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved through tabulation by building the solution bottom-up from the base case, which would be a square with side length 1.

State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where i is the row index (0-indexed) and j is the column index (0-indexed). Base case: dp[0][j] = 1 for all j because a single row can be tiled with one square.

The key observation is that dp[i][j] is minimized by considering all possible rectangles of size k x j with 0 <= k <= i-1 and adding the minimum number of squares required to tile that rectangle to 1 if i-k > 0 or j-k > 0. This is because we can either use a square of side length k or split the remaining area into smaller rectangles.

To implement this, create a table dp of size n+1 x m+1, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j.

The base case is straightforward: dp[0][j] = 1 for all j. For the recursive case, consider all possible rectangles of size k x j with 0 <= k <= i-1 and calculate the minimum number of squares required to tile that rectangle. If i-k > 0 or j-k > 0, add the minimum number of squares required to tile the remaining area (i.e., dp[i-k][j-k]) to the result.

To avoid redundant calculations, fill in the table in a bottom-up manner: start with the base case and work your way up. This ensures that each cell is only calculated once.

The plan does not explicitly account for edge cases, but since n and m are constrained between 1 and 13 inclusive, it should be sufficient to simply ensure that the base case is handled correctly.
