===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j) in the rectangle.

dp[i][j] is the sum of the minimum number of squares required to tile the top left sub-rectangle from (0, 0) to (i-1, j-1), the right side sub-rectangle from (0, i) to (j-1, 0), and the bottom sub-rectangle from (i, 0) to (n-1, m-1)

This approach seems correct so far. The state expression is well-defined, and the recurrence relation makes sense.

Use a 2D array dp of size n x m to store the minimum number of squares required to tile up to each cell, and update it using the recurrence relation.

Then, use a separate dictionary memo to store the intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

This approach can be further improved by considering the base cases. For example, when i or j is 1, there are no more cells to tile, so dp[i][j] should return 0.

The plan does not include edge cases explicitly, but it seems like the approach would work correctly for all valid inputs (n and m between 1 and 13 inclusive).

Overall, your plan looks good, and with some minor tweaks, it can be a solid foundation for solving this problem.
