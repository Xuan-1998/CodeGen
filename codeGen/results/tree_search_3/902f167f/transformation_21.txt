===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number}) representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j), where k and m are indices for the previous cells in the rectangle that can be used as the top-left corner of a square.

The minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j) depends on the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cells (k, m), where (i-k)*(j-m) is a square number.

Define a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems.
