===BEGIN PLAN REVISION===
The dynamic programming approach you suggested is a great start!

Your state expression, dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number}), looks correct. It captures the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j), considering all possible top-left corners of squares that can be used.

However, I think there's an issue with your plan: you haven't specified how you're going to handle the base case for the dynamic programming. You need a way to determine the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (0, 0), which is the starting point of your DP table.

To improve your plan, I suggest considering the following edge cases:

* What if n or m is 1? In this case, you only need one square to tile the entire rectangle.
* What if both n and m are equal to a perfect square (e.g., 4x4)? You can't use any squares at all in this case!

To handle these edge cases, you might want to add additional base cases or boundary checks.
