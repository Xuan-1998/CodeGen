Consider using memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state as dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile the first i rows and j columns of the original rectangle, and the base case is when i or j is 0.

dp[i][j] is the minimum of two cases: (1) placing a square of side length max(min(i, j), 1) and then tiling the remaining area, or (2) not placing any squares in this row and tiling the rest of the rectangle. In either case, dp[i-1][j-1] is the state for the remaining area.

Utilize a 2D array (list of lists) to implement dynamic programming, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile the first i rows and j columns of the original rectangle.
