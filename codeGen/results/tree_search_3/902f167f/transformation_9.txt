===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

Define the state expression as dp[(n-1)*(m-1)-i-j], where i and j are indices for the remaining cells in the rectangle, and dp is a 2D array with dimensions equal to the number of remaining cells. This can be considered as a top-down approach.
dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares needed to tile up to cell (i, j), considering all possible ways to place a square at that position.

Using a 2D array dp with dimensions (n*m-1) x (n*m-1) and filling it up using a nested loop.
