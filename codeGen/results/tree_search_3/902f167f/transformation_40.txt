===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

 Define the state as (i, j), where i represents the current row index and j represents the current column index, and the base case is when the remaining rectangle has a size of 0x0. This can be represented as dp[0][0] = 1, since one square is required to tile a 0x0 rectangle.

 Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where the state represents the minimum number of squares required to tile a sub-rectangle with dimensions i x j, for 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= m. This can be represented as dp[i][j], which is the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j.

 You can use a dictionary to store intermediate results where the key is the tuple (i, j) and the value is the minimum number of squares required. For example, you can initialize dp with zeros, then fill it in based on the sub-problems.

 To improve the plan, consider using a more efficient data structure than a dictionary for storing intermediate results. For example, you could use a 2D array or a list of lists to store the values of dp. This would allow you to access and modify the values in constant time, which can be beneficial for larger inputs.

 Some potential issues with the plan include:

* The base case might not cover all edge cases. For example, what if n = m = 0? Should the answer still be 1?
* The dynamic programming approach assumes that the problem has optimal substructure, i.e., the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle is the sum of the minimum numbers of squares required to tile its sub-rectangles. This assumption should hold for this problem.

 To include edge cases, consider adding checks at the beginning of your code to handle special cases such as n = m = 0.
