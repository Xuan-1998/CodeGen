===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state as dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile the first i rows and j columns of the original rectangle, and the base case is when i or j is 0.
This part looks good! You're correctly identifying the problem as a dynamic programming problem.

dp[i][j] is the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile a sub-rectangle of size i x j, where i > 0 and j > 0. This can be done by placing a square of side length min(i, j) and then tiling the remaining sub-rectangles.
This step looks good too! You're correctly reducing the problem to smaller sub-problems.

Create a dp table to store intermediate results with dimensions n+1 x m+1
This is also correct! The dynamic programming table should have one extra row and column for the base cases (i or j being 0).

However, I do think there's one potential issue: what if min(i, j) does not divide both i and j? In that case, you would need to handle it specially. But overall, your plan looks good!

One thing you could consider is writing a function to compute the minimum number of squares needed for a given sub-rectangle, and then use memoization to store the results. This could make the code more readable and easier to maintain.

And finally, it's always a good idea to test your code with some sample inputs to make sure it works correctly!
