===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved through tabulation by building the solution bottom-up from the base case, which would be a square with side length 1.

State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where (i, j) represents the current position in the rectangle and dp[k][l] is the minimum number of squares required to tile the sub-rectangle of size k x l. Base case: dp[0][j] or dp[i][0] because a single row or column can be tiled with one square.

Initially, the base cases should be handled correctly by setting dp[0][j] = 1 for all j and dp[i][0] = 1 for all i. This is because a single row or column can always be tiled with one square of size 1x1.

The recursive relation would be:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1 if i > 0 and j > 0

This is because the minimum number of squares required to tile a rectangle of size i x j is either one more than the minimum number of squares required to tile the sub-rectangle of size (i-1) x j, or one more than the minimum number of squares required to tile the sub-rectangle of size i x (j-1), depending on which side has a shorter length.

The plan does not explicitly handle edge cases such as when i or j is 0. However, this can be handled by setting the base cases correctly as mentioned earlier.

To improve the plan, it would be beneficial to add more detailed explanations and examples of how the state expression and recursive relation work together to solve the problem.
