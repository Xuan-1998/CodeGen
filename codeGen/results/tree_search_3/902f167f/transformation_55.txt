===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state as dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile the first i rows and j columns of the original rectangle, and the base case is when i or j is 0.
dp[i][j] is the minimum number of integer-sided squares required to tile a sub-rectangle of size i x j, where i > 0 and j > 0. This can be done by placing a square of side length min(i, j) and then tiling the remaining sub-rectangles.

Implement recursive function with memoization using dictionary
