===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved through tabulation by building the solution bottom-up from the base case, which would be a square with side length 1.

State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where i is the row index and j is the column index. Base case: dp[0][j] = 1 for all j because a single column can be tiled with one square.
dp[0][j] = 1
dp[i][0] = 1 for all i because a single row can be tiled with one square.

State expression (corrected): 
dp[i][j] = min( dp[k][k] + dp[i-k-1][j-k-1] for k in range(min(i,j)) )
Using a 2D list to store the dynamic programming table and updating it based on the state expression

Edge cases:
- The input constraints are that n and m are integers between 1 and 13 inclusive. This means we can initialize our DP table with dimensions (14,14) to cover all possible inputs.
- We also need to handle the case when i or j is 0.

Potential issues with the plan:
- If k >= min(i,j), dp[k][k] would be out of bounds for large values of i and j. 
- The state expression does not account for squares that are larger than the minimum of i and j. For example, if i = 2 and j = 3, the optimal solution might use a square with side length 2 to cover the entire rectangle.

To improve the plan:
- Initialize the DP table with dimensions (14,14) as mentioned earlier.
- Handle edge cases by initializing dp[0][j] = 1 for all j and dp[i][0] = 1 for all i.
- Modify the state expression to account for larger squares that can cover a portion of the rectangle.
- Add checks to ensure k is within bounds when calculating dp[k][k].
