===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

Define the state expression as dp[(n-1)*(m-1)-i- j], where i and j are indices for the remaining cells in the rectangle, and dp is a 2D array with dimensions equal to the number of remaining cells. This can be considered as a top-down approach.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares needed to tile up to cell (i, j), considering all possible ways to place a square at that position.

Using memoization with a decorator @lru_cache(None) to store the results of subproblems in a dictionary.

The plan seems correct so far. It's a good approach to tackle this problem using dynamic programming and memoization.

To improve the plan, consider the following:

* Make sure you handle the base case correctly. In this problem, it might be when i or j is 0.
* Think about how you can reduce the state space by pruning some branches that are clearly not optimal.
* Consider implementing a bottom-up approach instead of top-down, as it might be more efficient.

As for potential issues with the plan:

* Make sure your memoization decorator works correctly and doesn't consume too much memory.
* Check if there's any edge case you're missing. For example, what happens when n or m is 1?
* Consider handling cases where dp[i][j] cannot be calculated because it depends on a previous cell that hasn't been calculated yet.

Overall, the plan looks good and with some minor adjustments, it should work correctly.
