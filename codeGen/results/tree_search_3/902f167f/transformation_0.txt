===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

State expression: dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of squares required to tile the sub-rectangle from (0, 0) to (i, j).

Initialization:
- Set base cases for smaller sub-rectangles or edge cases (e.g., when i or j is 0).
- Determine the initial values for dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] based on the problem constraints.

Transition function:
- For each cell in the rectangle, update dp[i][j] based on the minimum number of squares required to tile its top-left neighbor (dp[i-1][j-1]), top neighbor (dp[i-1][j]), left neighbor (dp[i][j-1]), or a combination of these.

Square sizes:
- Determine which square sizes are relevant for this problem and how to efficiently generate them.
- Consider using precomputed values for smaller sub-problems or memoization to speed up the calculation.

Edge cases:
- Handle edge cases, such as when i or j is 0, or when a single square completely fills the sub-rectangle.

Optimizations:
- Apply any relevant optimizations to your dynamic programming approach.
