===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved through tabulation by building the solution bottom-up from the base case, which would be a square with side length 1.

State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where i is the row index and j is the column index. Base case: dp[i][0] = 1 for all i because a single column can be tiled with one square.

dp[i][j] = min( 
    dp[i-1][j] + 1, // tile horizontally
    dp[i][j-1] + 1   // tile vertically
) for all i and j

To avoid redundant calculations and store the results of subproblems, we can use memoization. We can create a 2D table dp of size n+1 x m+1 to store the minimum number of squares required for each subproblem.

We also need to handle edge cases:

* Base case: dp[0][j] = 0 for all j because an empty rectangle requires no tiling.
* Edge case: dp[i][0] = 0 for all i because a single row can be tiled with no squares (using the base case).

By using memoization and storing the results of subproblems, we can avoid redundant calculations and solve the problem more efficiently.
