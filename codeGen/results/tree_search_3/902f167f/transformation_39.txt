Your plan is a great start to solving this problem using dynamic programming! You've identified the key idea that each cell (i, j) can be solved by considering previous cells as top-left corners of squares.

Some minor suggestions for improvement:
* In the first state expression, you might want to add an additional condition to ensure that k and m are not equal to i or j, since those cells would already be considered in the subsequent iterations. This is because you're trying to find the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j), so you shouldn't count the same square multiple times.
* In the second state expression, you might want to add an additional condition to ensure that k+1 and j are within the valid range of indices for the rectangle. This is because you're trying to find the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j), so you shouldn't go out of bounds.
* You also might want to consider adding a base case for when i or j is 0, since in that case there's no need to consider previous cells as top-left corners of squares.

As for potential issues with the plan:
* One issue could be that your current approach considers all possible squares, including those that are too large or too small. You might want to add a condition to only consider squares whose side lengths are within a certain range (e.g., 1 to sqrt(min(i, j))).
* Another issue could be that your approach doesn't take into account the fact that different squares can overlap each other. You might want to add some logic to handle this case.

As for edge cases:
* What if n or m is 0? In that case, you wouldn't need any squares to tile the rectangle.
* What if n or m is 1? In that case, you would only need one square of side length 1 to tile the rectangle.
