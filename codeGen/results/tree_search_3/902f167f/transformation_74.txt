===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved through tabulation by building the solution bottom-up from the base case, which would be a square with side length 1.

State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where i is the row index and j is the column index. Base case: dp[0][j] = 1 for all j because an empty column can be tiled with one square. Additionally, base case: dp[i][0] = 1 for all i because a single row can also be tiled with one square.

dp[i][j] = min( dp[k][k] + (i-k-1)*(j-k-1) for k in range(min(i,j)) )

Creating a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary to avoid redundant computations. This is a good start as it takes into account the symmetry of the problem.

However, there are some potential issues with this plan:

* The base case for dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] might not be correct. A single row or column cannot necessarily be tiled with one square.
* The recursive formula dp[i][j] = min( ... ) might not cover all possible cases. For example, if i and j are both odd, then the minimum number of squares required to tile the rectangle would depend on whether the top-left 1x1 corner is covered by a square or not.

To improve this plan, we could add more base cases for dp[0][j] and dp[i][0]. For example, we could consider dp[0][j] = j because an empty column can be tiled with j squares of size 1x1. Similarly, we could consider dp[i][0] = i because a single row can also be tiled with i squares of size 1x1.

Additionally, we should make sure that the recursive formula takes into account all possible cases, including the case where i and j are both odd.

Finally, we should handle edge cases such as when n or m is equal to 1, or when they are both equal to each other. In this case, a single square of size n x n would be sufficient to tile the rectangle.
