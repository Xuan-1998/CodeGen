===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state as (i, j), where i represents the current row index and j represents the current column index, and the base case is when the remaining rectangle has a size of 0x0. This is because if we have no more rows or columns left to cover, we can stop calculating further.

Define state as dp[(n, m)] where n is the remaining row height and m is the remaining column width. Transition from one state to another by updating the state when a square is placed at the bottom or right edge of the rectangle. This means that whenever we place a square, we update our current state with the new dimensions.

Utilize a 2D array (dp) to store the minimum number of squares required for each sub-problem, initialized with infinity or some large value. This will help us keep track of how many squares are needed to cover different parts of the rectangle.

However, there's a potential issue here - what if we place a square that doesn't completely cover the remaining rectangle? For example, what if we have 3 rows left but our largest possible square only covers 2 rows? In this case, we would need to place another square (or squares) on top of it.

To handle this, we could add an additional dimension to our state dp[(n, m, k)] where k is the maximum size of a square that can fit in the remaining rectangle. This way, when we transition from one state to another, we also keep track of whether we've used up all available squares of that size or not.

We should also consider edge cases - what if n or m is 0? What if both are equal to 1? We might need to handle these separately because they have different characteristics (e.g., placing a single square).

Overall, the plan seems good, but we should be careful about handling edge cases and considering the possibility of leaving some rows or columns uncovered at any given time.
