===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number}) representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j), where k and m are indices for the previous cells in the rectangle that can be used as the top-left corner of a square.

State
Use a dictionary-based approach with memoization to store and retrieve previously computed subproblem solutions. This is necessary because we need to avoid redundant computation when calculating the minimum number of squares for each cell.

Initialization
Set dp[0][j] = 1 for all j, representing that one square (of size 1) is needed to tile the first row.
Similarly, set dp[i][0] = 1 for all i, representing that one square (of size 1) is needed to tile the first column.

Transition
For each cell (i, j), calculate the minimum number of squares required to tile up to that point by considering all possible top-left corners (k, m) of a square. If (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number and k < i and m < j, then consider the subproblem solution dp[k][m] + 1.

Optimization
Use memoization to store and retrieve previously computed subproblem solutions in a dictionary dp_dict. This will help avoid redundant computation when calculating the minimum number of squares for each cell.
