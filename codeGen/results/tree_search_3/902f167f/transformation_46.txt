Consider using memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

This approach is correct, as we want to minimize the number of squares needed to tile the rectangle. Memoization can help us achieve this by storing the minimum number of squares required for each sub-rectangle and reusing these values instead of recalculating them.

Define the state as (i, j), where i represents the current row index and j represents the current column index, and the base case is when the remaining rectangle has a size of 0x0.
This definition of the state is correct. We can use this state to keep track of the minimum number of squares required for each sub-rectangle.

Define state as dp[(n, m)] where n is the remaining row height and m is the remaining column width.
This definition of the state is also correct. The state will store the minimum number of squares required for a rectangle with size n x m.

Transition from one state to another by updating the state when a square is placed at the bottom or right edge of the rectangle.
This approach is correct as well. We can update the state by considering all possible sizes of squares that fit within the remaining rectangle and choosing the one that requires the minimum number of additional squares.

Employ a nested loop structure to iterate over the possible sizes of squares that can fit within the remaining rectangle and update the state accordingly.
This step is also correct. The nested loop will help us consider all possible sizes of squares and choose the one that minimizes the number of additional squares needed.
