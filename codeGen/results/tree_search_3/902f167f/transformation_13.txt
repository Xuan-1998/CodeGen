===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

Define the state expression as dp[(n-1)*(m-1)-i-1j], where i and j are indices for the remaining cells in the rectangle, and dp is a 2D array with dimensions equal to the number of remaining cells. This can be considered as a top-down approach.

dp[(n-1)*(m-1)-i-j] = min(dp[(n-1)*(m-1)-(k-1)-j] + dp[(n-1)*(m-1)-(i-1)-(l-1)] for k in range(1, i+1) for l in range(1, j+1))

Maintain a memoization dictionary d where the keys are tuples representing the remaining cells in the rectangle, and the values are the minimum number of squares required to tile those cells. Use this dictionary to store and retrieve the results of subproblems as they are solved.

To make the plan more efficient:

* Initialize dp with infinity for all entries except for the base case where i = 0 or j = 0.
* When calculating dp[(n-1)*(m-1)-i-j], check if there is a square that can be placed in this cell. If so, calculate the minimum number of squares to tile the remaining cells and add 1 for the current square.
* Use memoization to store and retrieve the results of subproblems as they are solved.

To handle edge cases:

* For n = 0 or m = 0, return 0 because an empty rectangle can be tiled with zero squares (i.e., no tiles).
* For n < 1 or m < 1, return infinity because it is impossible to tile a rectangle with negative dimensions.
* Check if the input values for n and m are within the given constraints (n, m <= 13).

This refined plan should be able to solve the problem correctly. However, please note that the complexity of this approach might be high due to the recursive nature of the dp array and the potential large number of subproblems.
