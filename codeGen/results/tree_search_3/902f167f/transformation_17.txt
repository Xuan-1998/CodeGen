===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number}) representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j), where k and m are indices for the previous cells in the rectangle that can be used as the top-left corner of a square.

Transition Relationship:
The transition relationship can be defined recursively as follows:

* If i == 0 or j == 0, then dp[i][j] = 0 (base case: no squares needed to tile an empty rectangle)
* For all other cells (i > 0 and j > 0), dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number}) representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j)

Initialization:
The base case values for the top row and left column can be initialized as follows:

* For each cell in the top row (i == 0), dp[0][j] = j (since no squares are needed to tile the top row)
* For each cell in the left column (j == 0), dp[i][0] = i (since no squares are needed to tile the left column)

Filling the Table:
The table can be filled in a bottom-up manner, starting from the base cases and recursively filling in the values for each cell.

Potential Issues with the Plan:

* The plan assumes that all possible combinations of squares will be explored, which may not be the case if there are many small squares that fit into larger ones.
* The plan does not account for edge cases where the rectangle has an odd number of rows or columns, or where the size of the square is greater than the size of the rectangle.

Edge Cases:
To handle these edge cases, additional base cases can be added to the initialization step:

* If i is odd and j is even (or vice versa), then dp[i][j] = 1 (since a single square will always fit into an odd-sized rectangle)
* If the size of the square is greater than the size of the rectangle, then dp[i][j] = 0 (since no squares are needed to tile an empty rectangle)

Overall, the plan provides a good starting point for solving this problem using dynamic programming. However, it may need to be modified to account for edge cases and potential issues with the transition relationship.
