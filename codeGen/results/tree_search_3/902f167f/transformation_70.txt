===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved through tabulation by building the solution bottom-up from the base case, which would be a square with side length 1.

State expression: dp[i][j] = min number of squares required to tile the rectangle of size i x j, where i is the row index and j is the column index. Base case: dp[i][0] = 1 for all i because a single column can be tiled with one square.
dp[i][j] = min( dp[i-1][j] + 1, dp[i][j-1] + 1 ) for all i and j

Consider using memoization with a dictionary to store the intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
