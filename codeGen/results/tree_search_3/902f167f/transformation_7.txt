===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

The state expression can be defined as dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j) in the rectangle.
dp[i][j] is the sum of the minimum number of squares required to tile the top left sub-rectangle from (0, 0) to (i-1, j-1), the right side sub-rectangle from (0, i) to (j-1, 0), and the bottom sub-rectangle from (i, 0) to (n-1, m-1)

However, this approach may not be optimal because it considers all possible sub-rectangles. A more efficient approach would be to only consider squares that can fit in the current cell.

Store the intermediate results in a dictionary memo where the key is the current state (i, j) and the value is the calculated minimum number of squares, then retrieve the values from the dictionary when needed.
This is a good idea, but it's not clear how you would calculate the minimum number of squares required to tile each cell.
