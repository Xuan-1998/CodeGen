===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be applied by treating each cell in the rectangle as a subproblem, where the minimum number of squares to tile up to that point is calculated recursively.

State expression:
dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number})
representing the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j), where k and m are indices for the previous cells in the rectangle that can be used as the top-left corner of a square.

State:
Use a dictionary dp as the memoization table, where keys are tuples of (i, j) and values are the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j).

Initial state: Initialize all values in the dp dictionary to infinity or a very large number, indicating that no solution has been found yet.

Base case: The base case is when i or j is 0. In this case, the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j) is always 0.

Recurrence relation:
For each cell (i, j), calculate the minimum number of squares required to tile up to that point by considering all possible previous cells that can be used as the top-left corner of a square. The recurrence relation is:

dp[i][j] = min({dp[k][m] + 1 | k < i and m < j and (i-k) * (j-m) is a square number})

This means that we consider all possible squares with side lengths from 1 to min(i, j), and for each of these squares, we recursively calculate the minimum number of squares required to tile up to the top-right corner of the square. The minimum value among these recursive calculations is the minimum number of squares required to tile up to cell (i, j).
