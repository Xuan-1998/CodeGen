===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose dynamic programming by identifying overlapping subproblems related to the number of teams, where each team's skill level is considered as a 'state'.
The state expression could be dp[i][j] representing the number of ways to win for team j in the first i rounds.

However, it seems that your plan lacks a crucial step: defining the recurrence relation. You need to establish how the dp array is populated based on the previous rounds. This will help you determine which teams can win and by what margin.

You can use a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to win for team j in the first i rounds, with base cases being teams that have already been eliminated or those that are still competing.

To improve your plan:

1. Define a clear recurrence relation: how does the current round affect the winning possibilities for each team?
2. Establish base cases: what happens when all teams but one have been eliminated? What about when only two teams remain?

Potential issues with the plan:

* You might need to handle edge cases, such as when there is only one team remaining or when all teams have the same skill level.
* The dynamic programming approach assumes that the number of teams and the skill levels are fixed. If these values change during the tournament, your solution will not work.

Edge cases:

* What if there's only one team left in the tournament?
* What if all teams but one have been eliminated?

To make your plan more robust, consider addressing these edge cases and potential issues.
