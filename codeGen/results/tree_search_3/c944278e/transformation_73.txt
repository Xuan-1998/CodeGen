===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on bottom-up approach with tabulation by understanding that the winning teams can be found by iteratively evaluating the results of each phase in the tournament, using arrays to store intermediate results.

The state expression could be a binary string where each character represents whether a team has won or not in the current phase. The base case would be when all characters have been processed, meaning all winning teams have been identified.

However, the plan seems to be missing a crucial step - determining which teams win based on their skill levels.

The state could represent a binary string where each character represents whether a team has won or not in the current phase. The winning teams can then be determined by evaluating all possible combinations of this binary string.

To implement tabulation with a 1D array, iterate over the binary string to determine which teams win based on their skill levels. For each character in the binary string, check if the corresponding team wins or not. If it does, update the state accordingly. This would involve updating the winning teams array with the current winner.

To handle edge cases, consider what happens when there are no winners (i.e., all characters in the binary string are 0). In this case, return an empty array indicating that there are no winning teams.

Additionally, it's important to note that the plan does not explicitly handle the constraint of $1 \leq n \leq 18$. It may be necessary to add some error checking code to ensure that the input is within these bounds and provide a meaningful error message if it's not.
