===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on bottom-up approach with tabulation by understanding that the winning teams can be found by iteratively evaluating the results of each phase in the tournament, using arrays to store intermediate results.

The state expression could be a list representing the current number of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from previous phases. The base case would be when only one team is left, which means it's the sole winner.

State: dp[i][j] represents the number of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from the first i phases, given that team j is the best among all remaining teams.

Use a 2D array dp with dimensions n+1 by 2^n to store intermediate results. 

For each phase i from 0 to n-1:
    For each possible result r from 0 to 2^i - 1:
        Update dp[i+1] based on the current state of dp[i]
        Calculate the number of teams that can still win considering the new result

Base case: dp[n][j] represents the number of teams that can still win when only one team is left, which means it's the sole winner. The winning teams are all teams j such that dp[n][j] > 0.

Note: This approach assumes that a team with higher skill level can beat any team with lower skill level in a phase. If this is not the case (e.g., there might be tie-breakers), additional logic would be needed to handle these cases.
