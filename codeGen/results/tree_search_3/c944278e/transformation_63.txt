The plan looks good overall, but there are some areas that could be improved or clarified.

Firstly, I like how you're approaching this problem with a dynamic programming mindset. Your idea of using arrays to store intermediate results is spot on.

However, I have some concerns about the state expression and the base case. You mention using a list to represent the current number of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from previous phases. But isn't the state just a single integer representing the total number of winning teams so far? The base case would be when only one team is left, which means it's the sole winner.

Regarding the transition rule, I think you're on the right track by considering the results from previous phases and updating the state accordingly. But what about edge cases? For instance, what if there are multiple winning teams in the current phase? Should we store all of them or just one?

Finally, while your idea of using memoization with a recursive function is good, I think you might want to reconsider this approach. The problem seems more suited for a bottom-up dynamic programming solution rather than top-down memoization.

Overall, I think your plan has some great ideas, but it could benefit from a bit more refinement and consideration of edge cases.
