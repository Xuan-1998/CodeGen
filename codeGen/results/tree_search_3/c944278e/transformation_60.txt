===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on bottom-up approach with tabulation by understanding that the winning teams can be found by iteratively evaluating the results of each phase in the tournament, using arrays to store intermediate results.

The state expression could be a list representing the current number of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from previous phases. The base case would be when only one team is left, which means it's the sole winner.

State: dp[i][j] represents the number of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from the first i phases, given that team j has skill level j.

Alternatively, you could use a dictionary to memoize the values of intermediate states as they are computed and then look them up later when needed.

However, I think there's a potential issue with this plan: it doesn't take into account the fact that teams can be eliminated from the tournament based on their performance in previous phases. For example, if team A beats team B in one phase, but both of them still have a chance to win the tournament, then we shouldn't eliminate team B just because team A won.

To address this issue, I would suggest adding another dimension to your state expression: dp[i][j][k] could represent the number of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from the first i phases, given that team j has skill level j and that team k is eliminated. This way, you'll be able to keep track of which teams are still in the running even if some have already been eliminated.

Additionally, I think it's important to clarify what exactly constitutes a "winning" team: does it mean the team with the highest skill level? Or does it depend on how many games they win? Without this clarification, the problem statement is open to interpretation, which could lead to different solutions.

Overall, your plan has some good ideas, but I think there are some areas that need further development and refinement. Keep working at it!
