===BEGIN PLAN UPDATE===

The overall approach to solve this problem using dynamic programming with tabulation looks good.

One suggestion I have is to add more details on how you would iterate through each phase in the tournament and update the state. You mentioned storing intermediate results in a dictionary, which seems like a good idea.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of your plan:

* Define the state as a binary string representing whether a team has won or not in the current phase.
* Initialize an empty dictionary to store intermediate results.
* Iterate through each phase in the tournament. For each phase:
	+ Process the result (binary string) for this phase.
	+ Update the state by applying the transition relationship based on the result of this phase.
	+ Store the updated state in the dictionary.

Some potential issues with your plan:

* You didn't mention what you would do when a team wins more than one phase. Would you keep track of all winning teams or just the first one?
* It's not entirely clear how you would handle edge cases, such as when no team has won by the end of the tournament.

To address these concerns, I suggest adding more details on handling these edge cases and providing examples to illustrate your approach.

Overall, your plan looks good, but could benefit from a bit more detail and consideration of edge cases. Keep up the good work!
