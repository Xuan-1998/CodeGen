===BEGIN PLAN REVISION===
The initial intuition on using Dynamic Programming is correct, but there are some improvements that can be made to the plan.

Select top-down approach with memoization by recognizing that the winning teams can be determined by checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, using recursion and memoization. This approach will help in avoiding redundant calculations and reduce the time complexity.

The base case is when the length of the binary string is 0, as there are no more phases to consider for determining the winning teams. The dynamic programming approach focuses on the skill levels of the teams at each phase of the tournament. The state would be a tuple consisting of the current team's skill level and the phase number.

The transition relationship would be the set of teams that can win with this skill level and phase number, considering all possible combinations of teams' skills.

To improve the plan, consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation instead of top-down memoization. This is because the problem requires filling a 2D array iteratively from the base case (length of binary string = 0) to larger phases.

Create a 3D array where the state is a tuple consisting of the current team's skill level, the phase number, and the value is a set of winning teams at that state. This will help in efficiently storing and retrieving information about the winning teams at different states.

Fill this array iteratively from the base case (length of binary string = 0) to larger phases, considering all possible combinations of teams' skills.

When determining the winning teams for each phase, consider the results of previous phases as denoted by the binary string. This will help in correctly identifying the teams that can win the tournament based on their skill levels and the outcome of previous matches.
