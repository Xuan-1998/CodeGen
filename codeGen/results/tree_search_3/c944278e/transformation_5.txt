===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose dynamic programming by identifying overlapping subproblems related to the number of teams, where each team's skill level is considered as a 'state'.
The state expression could be dp[i][j] representing the number of ways to win for team j in the first i rounds.
State transitions could be based on the binary string s, where dp[i][j] is updated as the maximum of dp[i-1][team] for teams that can beat team j in round i\
