===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose dynamic programming by identifying overlapping subproblems related to the number of teams, where each team's skill level is considered as a 'state'.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] representing the number of ways to win for team j in the first i rounds.

However, we need to consider that this problem has a specific constraint: the tournament structure. We can use a similar approach by considering the current round and the previous results.

One possible way is to implement memoization by using a dictionary dp where dp[(i, j)] is the number of ways to win for team j in the first i rounds, with base cases being teams that have already been eliminated or those that are still competing.

To further improve this plan, we can consider the following:

1. We need to consider how to calculate the number of ways to win for each team given its skill level and the previous results.
2. We should also consider how to handle the elimination process in the tournament. For example, if a team loses in a particular round, it will be eliminated from further competition.

In terms of potential issues with this plan, we can identify:

1. Handling edge cases: What happens when there's only one team left in the tournament? Do we need to consider special cases for teams that have already been eliminated or those that are still competing?
2. Complexity: The dynamic programming approach might become complex if not implemented correctly. We should ensure that our solution is efficient and scalable.

To address these issues, we can modify the plan as follows:
