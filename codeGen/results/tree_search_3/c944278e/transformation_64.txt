===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on bottom-up approach with tabulation by understanding that the winning teams can be found by iteratively evaluating the results of each phase in the tournament, using arrays to store intermediate results.

The state expression could be a list representing the current number of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from previous phases. The base case would be when only one team is left, which means it's the sole winner.

Transition: dp[i+1][k] = sum(dp[i][j] for j in range(2**i) if s[j] == k and team_j_skill_level <= k), where k is 0 or 1 (winning or losing).

Tabulation with a 1D array to store the cumulative results, iterating over each phase of the tournament.

To further improve this plan, we could consider using a 2D array instead of a 1D array for tabulation. This would allow us to store the intermediate results in a more structured way and potentially reduce the time complexity.

One potential issue with this plan is that it assumes all skill levels are unique, but the problem statement does not explicitly state this. We should consider edge cases where there may be multiple teams with the same skill level.

Edge cases:
- What if the input contains duplicate skill levels?
- How do we handle the case where a team can still win the tournament even though they didn't win their last match?

To address these issues, we could add additional checks and modifications to our plan. For example, when calculating the cumulative results, we could sort the teams by their skill levels first, then iterate over them.

Overall, your original plan shows a good understanding of dynamic programming and tabulation. With some further refinement and consideration of edge cases, this approach has great potential for solving the problem.
