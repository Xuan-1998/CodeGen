===BEGIN PLAN===
Select top-down approach with memoization by recognizing that the winning teams can be determined by checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, using recursion and memoization.

State: the result of the current phase in the tournament
A winning team can be characterized by its unique binary string representation, where each bit represents whether the team has won or lost against another team in the previous round. Transition relationships can then be defined based on the outcomes of these matches.

Create a 2D table to store the winning teams for each possible state and phase, where the table cell at row i and column j represents whether team i can win against team j in phase j.

To fill up the table, iterate through all possible binary strings of length n (representing the results of the tournament). For each string, calculate the skill levels of the teams based on their winning/losing streaks. Then, check if the calculated skill levels satisfy the condition for a team to win the tournament. If they do, add the team's representation in the string to the list of winning teams.

However, this plan can be improved by adding some edge cases and handling the problem more efficiently.

Potential issues with the plan:

1. The plan does not consider the case where n is large (i.e., 2^18). In this case, we would need a more efficient solution that does not involve generating all possible binary strings.
2. The plan does not handle the case where two or more teams have the same skill level and the same winning/losing streaks. In this case, we might consider treating these teams as a single entity.

Edge cases:

1. What if n is 0? In this case, there are no teams to consider.
2. What if all teams have the same skill levels? In this case, any team can win the tournament.
3. What if some teams do not participate in certain phases of the tournament? In this case, we need to adjust our calculations accordingly.
