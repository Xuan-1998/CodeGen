===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on bottom-up approach with tabulation by understanding that the winning teams can be found by iteratively evaluating the results of each phase in the tournament, using arrays to store intermediate results.

The state expression could be a list representing the current number of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from previous phases. The base case would be when only one team is left, which means it's the sole winner.

State: dp[i][j] represents the number of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from the first i phases, given that team j is the best among all remaining teams.

Utilize bottom-up dynamic programming by initializing dp[0][0] to the number of teams and filling up the rest of the table using previously computed values.
