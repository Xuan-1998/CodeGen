===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, I think we should take a bottom-up approach with tabulation. We can understand that winning teams can be found by iteratively evaluating the results of each phase in the tournament using arrays to store intermediate results.

The state expression could be a binary string where each character represents whether a team has won or not in the current phase. The base case would be when all characters have been processed, meaning all winning teams have been identified.

We can consider the state as a permutation of the $2^n$ teams, where the team at the head of the permutation has won the tournament, and the transition relationship involves updating this permutation based on the results of each phase.

Using a list of tuples to store the permutations of teams that have won the tournament, where each tuple contains the winning team's skill level and its corresponding permutation. We can sort these tuples in ascending order by the skill levels to get all the winning teams in ascending order as required.

To improve this plan, we could consider some edge cases, such as what happens if there are no winning teams (i.e., no team has won the tournament after all phases) or if there is only one winning team. We can also think about how to efficiently store and retrieve these tuples from memory.

One potential issue with this plan is that it does not take into account the fact that teams can be eliminated as the tournament progresses. We need to make sure we handle this correctly, perhaps by considering a set of "alive" teams at each stage and only updating our permutations accordingly.

In terms of edge cases, we should consider what happens if there are no winning teams (i.e., no team has won the tournament after all phases) or if there is only one winning team. We can also think about how to efficiently store and retrieve these tuples from memory.
