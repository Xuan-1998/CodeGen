===BEGIN PLAN===
Select top-down approach with memoization by recognizing that the winning teams can be determined by checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, using recursion and memoization.

State: the number of winning teams seen so far

Determine whether a given set of skill levels is sufficient for a team to win by comparing it with all other sets of skill levels. Use memoization to store the results of these comparisons.

However, upon further analysis, there are some potential issues with this plan:

* The problem statement only mentions $2^n$ teams, but the plan seems to be suggesting checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, which could lead to an exponential time complexity.
* The plan does not specify how to determine whether a given set of skill levels is sufficient for a team to win. This could involve comparing the skill levels with those of other teams, but this would require additional information or logic that is not specified in the plan.

To improve the plan, consider the following:

* Instead of checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, try to come up with a more efficient approach that takes into account the structure of the tournament and the skill levels of the teams.
* Consider using a more nuanced approach to determine whether a given set of skill levels is sufficient for a team to win. This could involve comparing the skill levels with those of other teams, but this would require additional information or logic that is not specified in the plan.

Edge cases to consider:

* What happens if there are no winning teams? Should the program return an empty list or throw an error?
* What happens if all teams have the same skill level? Should the program return a single team as the winner, or should it return all teams?
