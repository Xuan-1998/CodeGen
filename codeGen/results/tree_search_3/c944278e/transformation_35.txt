===BEGIN PLAN===
Select top-down approach with memoization by recognizing that the winning teams can be determined by checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, using recursion and memoization.

State: the number of winning teams seen so far
Consider a state as the current skill level and the set of winning teams found so far, and define a transition function that updates this state based on the results of the next phase of the tournament.

Using a dictionary to store intermediate results and update the solution by looking up previously computed values. This approach can be efficient in terms of time complexity since we're avoiding redundant computations.

However, there's a potential issue with this plan: it might not handle edge cases properly. For instance, what if two teams have the same skill level? Or what if some phases of the tournament are cancelled? We need to ensure that our transition function can handle such scenarios correctly.

To improve this plan, we could consider using a more robust data structure than just a dictionary. For example, we could use a Trie or a Fenwick tree to store the intermediate results and look up previously computed values.

Another potential issue is that the recursive approach might cause a stack overflow for large inputs (i.e., when n is close to 18). To mitigate this, we could consider using an iterative approach instead of recursion.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
