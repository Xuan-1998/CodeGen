Choose dynamic programming by identifying overlapping subproblems related to the number of teams, where each team's skill level is considered as a 'state'.
The state expression could be dp[j][i] representing whether team j has won by round i.
Dynamic programming by identifying overlapping subproblems related to the number of phases in the tournament, considering each team's skill level and win-loss records. The state expression could be dp[i][j] representing whether team j can win after phase i.
Memoizing a recursive function that calculates the winning teams based on their skill levels and past results.
