===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on bottom-up approach with tabulation by understanding that the winning teams can be found by iteratively evaluating the results of each phase in the tournament, using arrays to store intermediate results.

The state expression could be a list representing the current number of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from previous phases. The base case would be when only one team is left, which means it's the sole winner.

State: dp[i][j] represents the list of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from the first i phases, given that j is the skill level.

dp[i][j] = [[k for k in range(2**n) if s[i][k] == 'W'] if i > 0 else [range(2**n)] for j in range(2**n)]

===END PLAN===

Feedback: The overall approach of using dynamic programming with tabulation is a good starting point. However, there are some issues and areas that can be improved:

1. State definition: The state dp[i][j] is not entirely clear. It seems to represent the list of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from the first i phases, given that j is the skill level. However, it's not explicitly stated how this state relates to the previous states or the final answer.

2. Base case: The base case mentioned in the plan is when only one team is left. This is a good starting point, but it's not entirely clear what this means in terms of the state and how it affects the final answer.

3. Transition function: There doesn't seem to be a clear transition function that defines how dp[i][j] relates to dp[i-1][k]. Without such a function, it's difficult to see how the dynamic programming approach can be applied.

4. Edge cases: The plan doesn't explicitly mention any edge cases that might need special handling.

5. Complexity: The complexity of this approach is not entirely clear. Depending on the size of n and s[i], the time and space complexity could potentially be quite high.

To improve this plan, I would suggest:

1. Clarify the state definition and how it relates to previous states and the final answer.

2. Define a transition function that outlines how dp[i][j] relates to dp[i-1][k].

3. Consider edge cases that might need special handling, such as when n is 1 or s[i] contains only 'W's or 'L's.

4. Analyze the time and space complexity of this approach and consider potential optimizations.
