===BEGIN PLAN===
Select top-down approach with memoization by recognizing that the winning teams can be determined by checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, using recursion and memoization.

State: the number of winning teams seen so far
A state can be defined as a binary string representing the current skill levels of the top two teams, and transitions occur when one team beats another, updating the state to reflect the new winner.
Create a recursive function with memoization to store previously computed results and avoid redundant calculations.
