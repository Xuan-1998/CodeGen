===BEGIN PLAN===
Select top-down approach with memoization by recognizing that the winning teams can be determined by checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, using recursion and memoization.

The base case is when the length of the binary string is 0. In this case, there are only two teams left in the tournament (the current team and its opponent), so we simply check if the current team's skill level is greater than or equal to its opponent's skill level. If it is, then the current team wins.

The dynamic programming approach is based on the idea that each winning team can be determined by the skill levels of its opponents in the tournament. The state would be the current team's skill level, and the transition relationship would be the set of teams that can win with this skill level.

Use a recursive function to memoize the results of subproblems by storing them in a dictionary. This way, we avoid solving the same problem multiple times and reduce the time complexity.

Here are some potential issues with the plan:

1. The plan does not account for edge cases where there is only one team left in the tournament.
2. It assumes that the skill levels of the teams follow a specific pattern (i.e., all teams have unique skill levels).

To improve the plan, we can add more base cases to handle these edge cases and ensure that the algorithm handles all possible scenarios.
