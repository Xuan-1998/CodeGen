# Correct approach, using bottom-up dynamic programming with tabulation.
Decide on bottom-up approach with tabulation by understanding that the winning teams can be found by iteratively evaluating the results of each phase in the tournament, using arrays to store intermediate results.

The state expression could be a list representing the current number of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from previous phases. The base case would be when only one team is left, which means it's the sole winner.

Transition: dp[i+1][k] = [t for t in dp[i][j] if s[j] == k and team_j_skill_level <= k], where k is 0 or 1 (winning or losing). This seems correct, as you're considering the winning/losing teams from previous phases and their skill levels.

# Correct approach to dynamically create a set to store winning teams:
Dynamically Create a Set to Store Winning Teams: Use a set data structure to keep track of winning teams as the tournament progresses.
