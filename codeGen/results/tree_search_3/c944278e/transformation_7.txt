===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose dynamic programming by identifying overlapping subproblems related to the number of teams, where each team's skill level is considered as a 'state'.
The state expression could be dp[i][j] representing the number of ways to win for team j in the first i rounds.
Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] stores the maximum number of wins for team j after i rounds, considering all possible teams with skills up to j.

===END PLAN===
