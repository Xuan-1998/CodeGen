===BEGIN PLAN===
Select top-down approach with memoization by recognizing that the winning teams can be determined by checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, using recursion and memoization.

The base case is when the length of the binary string is 0. In this case, there's only one team, so we can return a set containing just that team.

The dynamic programming approach is based on the idea that each winning team can be determined by the skill levels of its opponents in the tournament. The state would be the current team's skill level, and the transition relationship would be the set of teams that can win with this skill level.

Create a bottom-up dynamic programming solution using a table to store the intermediate results, where each cell represents the set of winning teams for a given skill level and binary string length.

To improve the plan:

* Use a more robust memoization approach, such as storing the intermediate results in a dictionary or a cache.
* Consider using a more efficient data structure, such as a trie or a suffix tree, to store the sets of winning teams.
* Think about how to handle edge cases, such as when there are no winning teams or when the binary string is empty.

Potential issues with the plan:

* The plan might not correctly handle all possible scenarios, especially those involving edge cases.
* The memoization approach might not be efficient enough for large inputs.
* The dynamic programming solution might require a lot of memory to store the intermediate results.

To address these potential issues:

* Review the plan carefully and make sure it covers all possible scenarios.
* Consider using a more efficient data structure or algorithm to reduce the time and space complexity.
* Think about how to handle edge cases and make sure the solution is robust.

Edge cases:

* When the binary string is empty, there are no winning teams.
* When the length of the binary string is 1, there's only one team, so we can return a set containing just that team.
* When the binary string has all 0s or all 1s, there's only one possible winning team.
