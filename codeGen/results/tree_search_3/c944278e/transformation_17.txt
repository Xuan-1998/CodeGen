Your plan has some great ideas, but I think you can improve upon it by being more specific about how to apply dynamic programming. Here's a step-by-step analysis of your plan and potential improvements:

Choose dynamic programming by identifying overlapping subproblems related to the number of teams: This is a good start. However, you should specify what these subproblems are and how they relate to each other.

Define the state expression as dp[i] = [the sum of skill levels of all teams that can still participate in round i, or the total score of a possible match-up].: This seems like a bit too much information for the state. You might want to simplify it to just the number of teams that can still participate in each round.

The winning teams are those that have not lost yet. State: dp[i] = [the number of teams that can still participate in round i]. The transition relationship is based on the tournament rules where a winner advances to the next round and a loser drops out.: This makes sense, but you should specify how exactly you would update the state for each round.

Implement tabulation or memoization: You're on the right track. Tabulation might be more efficient for this problem since it doesn't require recalculating anything.

Implement bottom-up tabulation by iteratively computing the minimum number of teams required to win at each step i, based on the current state of the tournament.: This is a good approach. However, you should specify how exactly you would compute the minimum number of teams and what information you would need from previous rounds.

Some potential issues with your plan include:

* You might not handle edge cases correctly. For example, what if there are no teams left in round i?
* Your state transition relationship is a bit unclear. Make sure to specify how exactly you would update the state for each round.
* You didn't mention what the output would be. Would it just be the number of winning teams or their actual skill levels?

Overall, your plan has some good ideas, but could benefit from more specificity and clarity. Keep going!
