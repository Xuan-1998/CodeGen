===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose dynamic programming by identifying overlapping subproblems related to the number of teams, where each team's skill level is considered as a 'state'.
The state expression could be dp[i][j] representing the number of ways to win for team j in the first i rounds.

Applying memoization to a recursive function, with the function taking two parameters: current match number and team ID.
This approach seems correct so far. By using dynamic programming, you can avoid redundant calculations by storing the results of subproblems in a memory array (dp).

However, there are some potential issues with this plan:

1. The state expression dp[i][j] is not clearly defined. What does it mean to "win for team j in the first i rounds"? Is it the number of ways team j can win, or the probability of team j winning? Clarification on the state expression is necessary.

2. The memoized recursive function needs more detail. What are the base cases and recurrence relation for this function?

3. This plan does not address edge cases. For example, what if there's a tie in the number of ways to win for two or more teams? How would you handle this situation?

4. It would be helpful to include a clear description of how the final answer is obtained from the dp array.

Here's an updated version of your plan that addresses these issues:
