Select top-down approach with memoization by recognizing that the winning teams can be determined by checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, using recursion and memoization.

State: the number of winning teams seen so far

Determine whether a given set of skill levels is sufficient for a team to win by comparing it with all other sets of skill levels. Use memoization to store the results of these comparisons.

You can use memoization by storing the winning teams found so far in a dictionary, and then update this dictionary for each new set of skills. This approach ensures that you only calculate each set's sufficiency once.
