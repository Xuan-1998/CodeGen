===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose dynamic programming by identifying overlapping subproblems related to the number of teams, where each team's skill level is considered as a 'state'.
The state expression could be dp[i][j] representing the number of ways to win for team j in the first i rounds.

However, upon further analysis, it seems that this approach might not be sufficient. The problem requires us to determine all winning teams, which implies that we need to consider all possible match outcomes and team combinations.

To improve the plan, let's re-evaluate the problem statement:

* Given a binary string s of length n, where si denotes the result of the i-th phase of the tournament.
* Determine all the winning teams, i.e., teams that can win the tournament.

This suggests that we should focus on analyzing the binary string and its relationships with the team skill levels. This could involve using a dynamic programming approach to determine the number of ways for each team to win at different stages of the tournament.

To better capture this idea, let's modify our state expression:

* dp[i][j] could represent the number of ways for team j to win in the first i phases of the tournament.

This revised plan includes a more accurate representation of the problem and considers all possible match outcomes and team combinations. However, it still requires further refinement to effectively solve the problem.

Potential issues with this plan include:

* Handling edge cases: The plan should account for teams that can win at any stage of the tournament.
* Optimizing performance: A dynamic programming approach may require careful consideration of memoization techniques and pruning strategies to optimize performance.
* Clarifying the winning conditions: The plan should explicitly define what it means for a team to "win" in each phase of the tournament.

To improve this plan, let's consider these issues and refine our state expression accordingly.
