===BEGIN PLAN UPDATE===
Your initial plan shows good understanding of the dynamic programming approach. Here's an updated and refined plan:

===BEGIN PLAN UPDATE===
Decide on bottom-up approach with tabulation by understanding that the winning teams can be found by iteratively evaluating the results of each phase in the tournament, using arrays to store intermediate results.

The state expression could be a list representing the current number of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from previous phases. The base case would be when only one team is left, which means it's the sole winner.

Transition: dp[i+1][k] = [t for t in dp[i][j] if s[j] == k and team_j_skill_level <= k], where k is 0 or 1 (winning or losing). This transition step correctly updates the number of teams that can still win after considering the results from previous phases.

Dynamic Programming with Bottom-Up Approach: Implement a 2D array dp where each cell dp[i][j] stores the number of teams that can still win after i phases and j-th phase result is k. The base case is when i == n, indicating all phases have been processed.

To further refine your plan:

* Clarify how you will handle the initial state (i.e., what values to initialize dp[0][j] for j in range(2^n)) and ensure it correctly reflects the number of teams that can still win after considering the results from the first phase.
* Consider edge cases, such as when n is 1 or when all teams have the same skill level. How will your dynamic programming approach handle these situations?
* Think about how you can optimize the computation by reducing unnecessary iterations and utilizing the properties of binary strings to simplify the transition steps.
