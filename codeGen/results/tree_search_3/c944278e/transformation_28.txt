===BEGIN PLAN===
Select top-down approach with memoization by recognizing that the winning teams can be determined by checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, using recursion and memoization.

State: the result of the current phase in the tournament
Recognize that a winning team is one with the highest total skill level, which can be determined by iterating over all possible combinations of teams and selecting the combination with the maximum sum.
Store previous results in a memoized function to avoid redundant calculations

However, upon closer inspection, there are some potential issues with this plan:

1. **Recursive approach may cause exponential time complexity**: The recursive function could potentially visit every team, leading to an exponential time complexity that might exceed the given constraints (n <= 18).
2. **Memoization may not be enough to avoid redundant calculations**: Even if memoization is used, the number of combinations grows rapidly with n, which means there may still be too many repeated calculations.
3. **No explicit handling of edge cases**: There's no mention of what should happen when there are no winning teams or when all teams have the same skill level.

To improve this plan:

1. **Use dynamic programming instead of recursion**: This would allow you to avoid the potential exponential time complexity and reduce the number of repeated calculations.
2. **Implement a more efficient memoization scheme**: For example, use a hash table to store previously computed values rather than storing entire combinations.
3. **Explicitly handle edge cases**: Add checks for when there are no winning teams or all teams have the same skill level.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
