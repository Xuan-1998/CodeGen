===BEGIN PLAN===
Select top-down approach with memoization by recognizing that the winning teams can be determined by checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, using recursion and memoization.

State: the number of winning teams seen so far
Consider a state as the current skill level and the set of winning teams found so far, and define a transition function that updates this state based on the results of the next phase of the tournament.

Employing memoization by creating a cache to store the results of expensive function calls, and reuse these cached results when possible.

Key steps:
- Initialize an empty set for the winning teams
- Define a recursive function that takes the current skill level and the result of the current phase as input
- In each recursive call, check if the current team wins based on the given condition (winning teams are determined by their skills)
- If the current team wins, update the state by adding it to the set of winning teams
- Recursively call the function for the next phase with an updated skill level and the result of the current phase
- Use memoization to store the results of each recursive call in a cache, so that if the same state is encountered again, the cached result can be reused instead of recalculating it

Edge cases:
- Handle the case where n = 0 or s = ""
- Handle the case where there are no winning teams
- Handle the case where all teams have the same skill level

Potential issues with the plan:
- The recursive function may cause a stack overflow for large values of n
- The cache may grow too large and consume too much memory
- The transition function may need to be updated based on the specific condition for winning teams
- The set of winning teams may not be unique, so it should be checked for duplicates

Improved plan:
- Use an iterative approach instead of recursion to avoid stack overflow issues
- Implement a more efficient data structure for the cache, such as a trie or a hash table, to reduce memory usage
- Update the transition function based on the specific condition for winning teams
- Sort the set of winning teams in ascending order before returning it
