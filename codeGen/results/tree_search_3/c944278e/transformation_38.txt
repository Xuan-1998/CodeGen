===BEGIN PLAN===
Select top-down approach with memoization by recognizing that the winning teams can be determined by checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, using recursion and memoization.

State: the number of winning teams seen so far
A state can be defined as a binary string representing the current skill levels of the top two teams, and transitions occur when one team beats another, updating the state to reflect the new winner.

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by creating a 2D table where each cell represents whether a given set of teams can win the tournament or not.

Some potential issues with this plan are:
- The transition states might be too complex to handle efficiently. 
- The problem constraints mention that n <= 18, which could lead to an exponential number of possible states in the worst case scenario.
- There is no clear stopping condition for the memoization process.

To improve the plan:
- Instead of using a binary string as the state, consider representing it with integers (0 or 1) to avoid the overhead of string manipulation. 
- Consider implementing pruning strategies for the dynamic programming table to reduce the number of possible states and improve performance.
- Implementing proper memoization and stopping conditions to prevent unnecessary computations.

The plan does not seem to include edge cases, such as when n = 0 or when there are no winning teams in a tournament.
