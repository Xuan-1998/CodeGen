===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose dynamic programming by identifying overlapping subproblems related to the number of teams, where each team's skill level is considered as a 'state'.

State definition: 
We'll use a binary string s to represent the state of each team. Each bit in the string corresponds to a match outcome (win or lose). We'll combine the skill levels of two teams by performing a bitwise XOR operation on their corresponding bits.

Subproblem identification:
The subproblems are about determining the winning teams in each round of the tournament. We can define dp[i][j] as the number of ways team j can win in the first i rounds.

Memoization:
We'll create a dictionary memo to store intermediate results and look them up instead of recalculating. For example, if we've already calculated dp[3][5], we can simply look it up in memo instead of recomputing it.

Edge cases:
We'll explicitly handle edge cases like single-team tournaments or all-teams-eliminated situations by considering the base cases and adjusting our dynamic programming approach accordingly.
