===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on bottom-up approach with tabulation by understanding that the winning teams can be found by iteratively evaluating the results of each phase in the tournament, using arrays to store intermediate results.

The state expression could be a list representing the current number of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from previous phases. The base case would be when only one team is left, which means it's the sole winner.

State: dp[i][j] represents the list of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from the first i phases, given that j is the skill level.
dp[i][j] = [team for team in dp[i-1][j-1] if s[i-1][team] == 'W']

Note: The plan seems to be on the right track. However, there are a few issues and areas for improvement.

* The state expression is not clearly defined. It's not clear what the skill level j represents or how it affects the winning teams.
* The base case is correct, but the recursive formula dp[i][j] = [team for team in dp[i-1][j-1] if s[i-1][team] == 'W'] needs further clarification. For example, what happens when a team loses a game? Should it be removed from the list of winning teams?
* The plan does not explicitly address edge cases such as when there are no more winning teams (i.e., all teams have been eliminated).
* It would be helpful to clarify how the results of each phase affect the winning teams. For example, do the results of earlier phases affect the winning teams in later phases?

Overall, the plan has a good starting point, but it needs further refinement and clarification.
