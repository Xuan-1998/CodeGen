===BEGIN PLAN===
Select top-down approach with memoization by recognizing that the winning teams can be determined by checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, using recursion and memoization.

State: the number of winning teams seen so far
A state can be defined as a binary string representing the current skill levels of the top two teams, and transitions occur when one team beats another, updating the state to reflect the new winner.

Implement a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm with memoization to explore all possible combinations of winning teams.
Consider maintaining a set or array to store unique winning teams, as you iterate through the states. This can help in keeping track of the number of distinct winners.

Potential issues to consider:
- Handling edge cases: What happens when there are no more teams left? Should we stop exploring further?
- Memoization strategy: How will we efficiently store and retrieve memoized results?
- State representation: Is a binary string sufficient to represent all possible states, or should we use a different data structure?

Improvement suggestions:
- Consider using a hash table (dictionary in Python) for memoization, as it can provide O(1) lookups.
- If the number of winning teams is very large, consider using a trie data structure instead of an array to store unique winners.

Edge cases to consider:
- What happens when there's only one team left? Should we count that as a winner?
- How do we handle ties (when two or more teams have the same skill level)? Do we consider each tied team as a separate winner?

This plan appears to be a good starting point, but it's essential to refine and adjust based on specific implementation details. The use of memoization and DFS can help in efficiently exploring all possible combinations.
