===BEGIN PLAN===
Select top-down approach with memoization by recognizing that the winning teams can be determined by checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, using recursion and memoization.

State: the result of the current phase in the tournament
Consider a state as a set of 'win' or 'lose' flags indicating how well a team is performing at each phase, and define transition relationships based on the skill levels of teams participating in each match.

Key idea: A winning team is one that has won all its matches so far.
To determine if a team wins, check if it has won every match up to this point. If yes, then it's a potential winner.

Memoization:
- Store intermediate results (states) as we explore the tournament tree
- Use memoized values when exploring subsequent branches in the tree

Potential issues with the plan:
- The problem description does not specify whether there are any tie-breakers for matches that end in draws. If there are no tie-breakers, then a team cannot win if it has drawn some of its matches.
- There might be edge cases where all teams have identical skill levels and the tournament is essentially a draw.

To handle these issues:
- Add an additional flag to indicate whether a team has drawn (or lost) a match. This will allow you to correctly determine winning teams even in case of draws.
- Add checks for tie-breakers if specified
- Use memoization to avoid redundant calculations and optimize the recursive function

Edge cases: 
1. All teams have identical skill levels, i.e., all matches end in draws.
In this case, there are no winners.

2. One team has significantly higher skill level than others.
In this case, that team will likely emerge as a winner.
