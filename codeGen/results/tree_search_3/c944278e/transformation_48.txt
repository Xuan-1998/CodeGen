===BEGIN PLAN===
Select top-down approach with memoization by recognizing that the winning teams can be determined by checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, using recursion and memoization.

The base case is when the length of the binary string is 0
This makes sense as there are no more phases to consider, so we simply return an empty set of winning teams or a specific default value (e.g., an empty array).

The dynamic programming approach considers the winning teams as a combination of skills from different phases of the tournament. The state would be the set of teams' skills up to a certain phase, and the transition relationship would be the set of teams that can win given their skills in previous phases.
This is correct! We're trying to build up the solution by considering all possible combinations of teams' skills.

Employ bottom-up dynamic programming by iterating over all possible subproblems and storing the solutions in a 2D table for later lookup.
This approach makes sense, as we want to avoid recalculating the same subproblem multiple times. By storing the solutions in a 2D table, we can look up the solution to a subproblem quickly if it's already been calculated.

Some potential issues with this plan include:
* Handling edge cases: What happens when there are no teams left that can win? How do we handle this case?
* Memoization: Will memoization be effective in reducing the time complexity of our solution, or will it lead to excessive memory usage?

Overall, your plan is correct and shows a good understanding of dynamic programming. To improve it, you could consider adding more details about how you would implement the memoization and edge cases.
