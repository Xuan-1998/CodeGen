===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose dynamic programming by identifying overlapping subproblems related to the number of teams, where each team's skill level is considered as a 'state'.
Define the state expression as dp[i] = [the sum of skill levels of all teams that can still participate in round i, or the total score of a possible match-up]. This seems correct, but it might be more accurate to define the state expression as dp[mask] = [the number of teams with skill level represented by mask that can still participate].
The winning teams are those with the highest skill level. A team wins if all its opponents lose. State: dp[i] = [the number of teams that can still participate in round i]. This seems correct, but it might be more accurate to define the state as dp[mask] = [whether any team represented by mask can still participate].
The transition relationship is based on the elimination process where a team loses to another team, and thus is no longer eligible for further rounds. Implement tabulation or memoization.
The dynamic programming approach involves initializing a 2D array dp with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), where each cell dp[i][mask] represents the number of teams that can still participate in round i, given their skill levels represented by mask.

To avoid unnecessary computation, we should fill the dp table bottom-up. We start from the last round and work our way backwards to the first round.
To make the state space smaller, we can use bitwise operations to represent the teams' skill levels.
We need to handle edge cases such as when n is 0 or less.
