===BEGIN PLAN===
Select top-down approach with memoization by recognizing that the winning teams can be determined by checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, using recursion and memoization.

State: the result of the current phase in the tournament

Recognize that a winning team is one with the highest total skill level, which can be determined by iterating over all possible combinations of teams and selecting the combination with the maximum sum.

Apply dynamic programming approach by creating a 2D table to store solutions to subproblems:
    - Initialize memoization table dp[][] with dimensions n*n
    - For each i from 0 to 2^n-1, for each j from 0 to i, calculate and store the winning team for the current combination of teams.
    - Recursively iterate over all possible combinations of teams until reaching base cases (e.g., a single team or a phase with no more games).
    - Store solutions in memoization table dp[][].

To optimize this approach:
    1. Use bitwise operations to generate and check all combinations efficiently.
    2. Sort the skills before calculating winning teams, as this will reduce the number of comparisons needed to find the maximum sum.
    
Potential issues with the plan:
    - The time complexity could be high due to the recursive nature and the large number of possible combinations.
    - It might not correctly handle cases where multiple teams have the same highest total skill level.

Edge cases:
    - Handle case when n is 1 (only one team).
    - Handle case when s is all zeros (no winning team).
