===BEGIN PLAN===
Select top-down approach with memoization by recognizing that the winning teams can be determined by checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, using recursion and memoization.

State: the number of winning teams seen so far
Determine whether a given set of skill levels is sufficient for a team to win by comparing it with all other sets of skill levels. Use memoization to store the results of these comparisons.

Memoization can be used to store the results of checking whether a set of skill levels is sufficient for a team to win. This approach can be implemented using a dictionary where each key is a unique combination of skill levels and the corresponding value indicates whether it's sufficient to win.

Potential issues with the plan:
- The current plan does not take into account the constraints given in the problem statement, specifically the constraint that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18. This could lead to inefficiencies or incorrect results if not handled properly.
- The plan does not specify how to determine which team is "better" in a particular phase of the tournament. This could be an important consideration when determining whether a set of skill levels is sufficient for a team to win.

Edge cases:
- The case where n = 1, i.e., there is only one team participating in the tournament.
- The case where all teams have the same skill level, making it impossible to determine which team wins.

How can it be improved?
- Add constraints and edge case handling as mentioned above.
- Consider a more efficient approach than brute-force checking of all possible combinations of teams' skills. This could involve using bit manipulation or other techniques to reduce the number of combinations that need to be checked.

Is the plan correct? 
The plan is not entirely incorrect, but it can be improved as suggested above.
