===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on bottom-up approach with tabulation by understanding that the winning teams can be found by iteratively evaluating the results of each phase in the tournament, using arrays to store intermediate results.

The state expression could be a list representing the current number of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from previous phases. The base case would be when only one team is left, which means it's the sole winner.

Transition: dp[i+1][k] = sum(dp[i][j] for j in range(2**i) if s[j] == k), where k is 0 or 1 (winning or losing). This step calculates the total number of winning teams that can still win after considering the results from the current phase.

To implement this plan, we can use a 1D array dp[] to store the total number of winning teams after each phase, and update it based on the results from previous phases. The size of dp[] would be 2^(n+1), where n is the input integer.

We need to ensure that the base case is correctly handled by initializing the first element of dp[] as 1, since there's only one team left at the beginning of the tournament. Then, we can iterate over each phase and update dp[] based on the results from previous phases.

The time complexity would be O(2^n), which is acceptable given the constraints (n <= 18).

However, it's essential to consider edge cases such as when n is 1 or 0. In these cases, there's only one team left or no teams at all, respectively. We need to handle these special cases explicitly.

Finally, we can sort the winning teams in ascending order based on their skill levels and return the result.
