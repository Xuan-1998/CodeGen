Choose dynamic programming by identifying overlapping subproblems related to the number of teams, where each team's skill level is considered as a 'state'.
The state expression could be dp[j][i] representing whether team j has won by round i.
Dynamic programming by identifying overlapping subproblems related to the number of teams, where each team's skill level is considered as a 'state'. The state expression could be dp[j][i] representing whether team j has won by round i.

Iterating over the binary string to identify winning teams, you can use a dictionary to store the skill levels of each team and check if any team's cumulative skill level is higher than others.
