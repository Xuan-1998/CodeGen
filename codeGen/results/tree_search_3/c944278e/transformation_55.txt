===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on bottom-up approach with tabulation by understanding that the winning teams can be found by iteratively evaluating the results of each phase in the tournament, using arrays to store intermediate results.

The state expression could be a list representing the current number of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from previous phases. The base case would be when only one team is left, which means it's the sole winner.

State: dp[i][j] represents the number of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from the first i phases, given that team j is the best among all remaining teams.

However, we need to consider two possibilities for each phase:
- Team j wins this phase and becomes the best.
- Team j loses this phase and is no longer the best (or even eliminated).

This means we can't simply update dp[i][j] based on the result of the current phase. Instead, we need to iterate over all teams that are still in the tournament after considering the results from previous phases and find those that can still win.

To avoid redundant calculations, we can use memoization by defining a function that takes an index i and returns the value stored at dp[i][j], avoiding redundant calculations for different values of j.

After all phases have been considered, we can iterate over the last row of the dp table to find the winning teams (i.e., those with more than one team that can still win).

The plan does include edge cases: when only one team is left (base case), and when there are no teams left in a phase.

To improve this plan, we could consider using a more efficient data structure for storing intermediate results. For example, if the tournament size grows very large, it might be beneficial to use a binary search tree or heap instead of an array to store the teams that can still win.
