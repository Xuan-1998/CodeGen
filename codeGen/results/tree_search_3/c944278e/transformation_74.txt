Your plan is correct in the sense that you're taking a bottom-up approach with tabulation, which is suitable for this problem. You've identified the state expression as a binary string representing whether a team has won or not in each phase.

However, I think there's room for improvement in terms of clarity and accuracy. Here are some suggestions:

* Instead of using an integer to represent the number of teams that have won up to the current phase, you could use a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the total number of winning combinations possible at the j-th phase given the first i bits in the binary string.

This would make it easier to understand how the transition relationship works. For example, if we're considering the first i bits and we know that the (i-1)th bit is a win for team A, then dp[i][j] would be the sum of dp[i-1][k] for all k such that the k-th bit is a loss for team A.

* You may also want to consider edge cases. For example, what if n = 0? In this case, there are no teams and therefore no winning teams. Your plan should handle this case correctly.
