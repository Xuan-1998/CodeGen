===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on bottom-up approach with tabulation by understanding that the winning teams can be found by iteratively evaluating the results of each phase in the tournament, using arrays to store intermediate results.

The state expression could be a list representing the current number of teams that can still win the tournament after considering the results from previous phases. The base case would be when only one team is left, which means it's the sole winner.

Transition: dp[i+1][k] = sum(dp[i][j] for j in range(2**i) if s[j] == k and team_j_skill_level <= k), where k is 0 or 1 (winning or losing).

Dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach using a 2D array to store the intermediate results.
