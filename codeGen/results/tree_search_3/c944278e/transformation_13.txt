===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose dynamic programming by identifying overlapping subproblems related to the number of teams, where each team's skill level is considered as a 'state'.
Define the state expression as dp[i] = [the sum of skill levels of all teams that can still participate in round i, or the total score of a possible match-up].
The winning teams are those with the highest skill level. A team wins if all its opponents lose. State: dp[i] = [the number of teams that can still participate in round i]. The transition relationship is based on the elimination process where a team loses to another team, and thus is no longer eligible for further rounds.
Implement tabulation or memoization.

**Analysis**
Your plan seems correct! You correctly identified dynamic programming as the approach. Your state expression makes sense, considering the skill levels of teams that can still participate in each round. The transition relationship also appears to be based on the elimination process.

However, I would like to suggest a small modification: instead of storing the sum of skill levels or the total score, consider storing the **number** of teams that can still participate in each round. This would make the state expression more concise and easier to work with.

Another suggestion is to add edge cases! What if there are no teams left after some rounds? Or what if a team's skill level is not unique (i.e., multiple teams have the same skill level)? You might want to consider these scenarios when implementing your solution.

Lastly, you mentioned memoization as an optimization technique. This is a good idea, especially since you're dealing with overlapping subproblems! However, I would recommend using tabulation instead of memoization. Tabulation allows for more efficient computation and avoids the overhead of function calls.
