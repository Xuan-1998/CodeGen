The overall approach you've taken is correct, using dynamic programming with tabulation to solve this problem. Your understanding that the winning teams can be found by iteratively evaluating the results of each phase in the tournament is spot on.

Your state expression idea is also good - representing a binary string where each character represents whether a team has won or not in the current phase. The base case of processing all characters is also correct, meaning all winning teams have been identified.

One potential issue with your plan is that you might need to handle edge cases where some teams don't participate in certain phases. For example, if some teams are eliminated early on in the tournament, they won't be considered for later rounds. Make sure to think about how you'll handle these scenarios.

Another thing to consider is that the transition relationship between states might not be as simple as just updating a permutation based on the results of each phase. You might need to keep track of which teams are still in the running and update your state accordingly.

To improve your plan, I would suggest adding more detail about how you'll handle these edge cases and what specific transitions will happen between states. Additionally, consider whether there's a way to reduce the number of states you need to store or compute.

Here's an updated version of your plan with my feedback:
