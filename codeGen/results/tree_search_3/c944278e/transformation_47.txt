===BEGIN PLAN===
Select top-down approach with memoization by recognizing that the winning teams can be determined by checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, using recursion and memoization.

The base case is when the length of the binary string is 0 (no phases left). This makes sense as there would be no more teams to consider for winning.

The dynamic programming approach considers the winning teams as a combination of skills from different phases of the tournament. The state would be the set of teams' skills up to a certain phase, and the transition relationship would be the set of teams that can win given their skills in previous phases.

This part is good! You're correctly recognizing the dynamic programming structure of this problem.

Use top-down dynamic programming with memoization by defining a recursive function to calculate all possible combinations of teams' skills, and store the results in a dictionary for future use.

However, it might be more efficient to define a bottom-up approach instead. This is because you can start from the base case (length 0) and gradually build up the solutions for longer lengths.
