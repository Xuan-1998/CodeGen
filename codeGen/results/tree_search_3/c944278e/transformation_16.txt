Your plan seems to be a good start, but there are a few things you can improve.

Firstly, you're right that dynamic programming is suitable for this problem. Identifying the overlapping subproblems and designing a state expression are crucial steps in this approach.

However, your state expression could be more specific. Instead of considering "the sum of skill levels of all teams that can still participate in round i, or the total score of a possible match-up", you should consider the number of teams that can still participate in round i, as you mentioned later on. This is because you're trying to find all the winning teams, which are those that have not lost yet.

Your transition relationship seems correct based on the tournament rules. A winner advances to the next round and a loser drops out, so this should be reflected in your state transition function.

One potential issue with your plan is that you might need to handle tie-breakers differently. If two teams have the same skill level, they could both advance or drop out together, depending on the tournament rules. You'll need to consider how you want to handle these cases.

Finally, make sure you include edge cases in your implementation. For example, what if there are no winning teams? Your solution should be able to handle this situation correctly.

Overall, your plan is a good start, and with some adjustments, it could become an effective solution.
