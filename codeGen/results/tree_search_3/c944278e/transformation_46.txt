===BEGIN PLAN===
Select top-down approach with memoization by recognizing that the winning teams can be determined by checking all possible combinations of teams' skills, using recursion and memoization.

The base case is when the length of the binary string is 0. In this case, there is only one winning team, which is the one with the highest skill level.

The dynamic programming approach is based on the idea that each winning team can be determined by the skill levels of its opponents in the tournament. The state would be the current team's skill level, and the transition relationship would be the set of teams that can win with this skill level.

To implement a depth-first search (DFS) approach with memoization, create a dictionary to store the results of subproblems. For each possible combination of teams' skills, recursively generate all possible combinations of opponents' skills, and then check if any of these opponents have higher skill levels than the current team. If so, add them to the set of winning teams.

To avoid redundant calculations, use memoization to store the results of subproblems as they are generated. This will allow you to quickly look up the results of previously solved subproblems instead of recalculating them.
