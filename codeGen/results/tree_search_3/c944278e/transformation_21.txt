To develop a correct dynamic programming solution, let's analyze each step:

1. **Identify overlapping subproblems**: The problem statement suggests that we need to determine all winning teams. This implies that we should consider the tournament as a whole and not just individual matches or phases. Therefore, the overlapping subproblem could be: given the results of the first i phases (where i is the current phase), what are the possible winning teams?

2. **State expression**: A suitable state expression could be dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents whether team j can win after phase i.

3. **Base case**: The base case would be when we have reached the last phase (i.e., i = n). In this case, we can directly determine the winning teams by examining the results of the tournament.

4. **Recursive relation**: To fill in the dp array, we need a recursive relation that takes into account the previous phases and their outcomes. Specifically, for each team j, we can consider two possibilities: either team j wins or loses its match in phase i.

5. **Transition from base case to recursive relation**: To determine whether team j can win after phase i, we would recursively call dp[i-1][j] if the result of the previous phase is 0 (team j won), and dp[i-1][k] for each k != j if the result of the previous phase is 1 (team j lost).

6. **Initialization**: We should initialize the dp array with base cases: dp[0][j] = 1 if team j has the highest skill level, and 0 otherwise.

7. **Iterative approach**: To improve the plan's efficiency, we can use an iterative approach instead of a recursive one to fill in the dp array. This would reduce the time complexity from exponential to polynomial (O(n \* 2^n)).

8. **Edge cases**: We should consider edge cases where n = 1 or n = 2, which have specific solutions without requiring dynamic programming.
