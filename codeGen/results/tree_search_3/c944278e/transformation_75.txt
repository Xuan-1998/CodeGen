===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on bottom-up approach with tabulation by understanding that the winning teams can be found by iteratively evaluating the results of each phase in the tournament, using arrays to store intermediate results.

The state expression could be a binary string where each character represents whether a team has won or not in the current phase. The base case would be when all characters have been processed, meaning all winning teams have been identified.

The state could be a binary string representing the current state of the tournament, and the transition relationship would be based on the result of each phase (win or lose).

You can utilize memoization by creating a dictionary where the key is the current state and the value is the corresponding list of winning teams, allowing for efficient lookup and computation.
