===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach uses tabulation to fill up a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there are no paths to consider.

dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, where dp[0][k] represents the base case for all k, meaning there's only one option (the topmost element) that doesn't depend on previous choices.

dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, where dp[i-1][k] represents the state from the previous row. The transition relationship can be formulated as taking the minimum between the current element's value and skipping it.

mem = { } ; def min_path_sum(i, j): if (i,j) not in mem: ...
