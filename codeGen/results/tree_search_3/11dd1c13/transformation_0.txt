===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

The state expression is:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][min(j-1, n-1)]) + grid[i][j]

for j in range(n)
This plan considers each element of the grid separately. The base case for this dynamic programming problem would be when i or j is 0, which means we are either at the first row or the last column.

Using a 2D array to store the dynamic programming states and filling them up from top-down

The initial state dp[0][j] = grid[0][j] for all j in range(n) since there's no previous element in the same column.
Then fill up the rest of the dp table based on this recurrence.

This plan does include edge cases. The base case is handled correctly by considering only elements that are not at the first row or last column.

The potential issue with this plan is that it doesn't handle the problem constraints properly. For example, what if j > n? In this case, we should consider j = n-1 instead.
We need to make sure that j and i are within the valid range before accessing them in the grid.
