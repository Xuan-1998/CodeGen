===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

Initially, I think this is a good approach. You're trying to break down the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively or iteratively using dynamic programming.

Consider the base case: dp[0][j] = -99 for all j. This makes sense because there's no path in an empty grid, so the minimum sum should be -99 (or a value indicating that).

Now let's think about the recursive relationship. You're considering two cases:

1. The current element is part of the falling path: dp[i][j] = min(sum(grid[k][min(j, len(grid[0]))) for k in range(i)))
2. The current element is not part of the falling path: dp[i][j] = -99

The issue I see is that you're not considering all possible shifts. You need to account for the possibility of shifting elements up and down.

A better approach might be to consider all possible shifts, calculate the minimum sum for each shift, and then take the minimum among those sums.

Here's an updated plan:
