===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach uses tabulation to fill up a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there are no paths to consider.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, where:
- If i == 0, then dp[i][j] = 0, because there are no paths to consider.
- For other values of i, we need to consider all possible choices for the current element (i.e., taking it or not). This can be done by considering the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts from row i-1 and column j-1 if the current element is taken, and dp[i][j-1] if the current element is not taken. We add the value of the current element to this minimum sum.

Use a 2D table to store the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts for each sub-grid.

Feedback:
The plan looks good! You've correctly identified that the problem can be solved using dynamic programming, and you've outlined the correct approach. The base case is well-defined, and the recursive formula for dp[i][j] makes sense.

Improvements:
One potential improvement is to explicitly consider the cases where j == 0 or i == 0 separately, as these are special cases that require different handling. This could be done by adding a separate condition in the recursive formula.

Edge cases:
The plan does not specifically consider edge cases, but it's likely that the base case of dp[0][j] = 0 for all j will handle any edge cases related to the first row. However, if there are additional edge cases related to the last column or other parts of the grid, they should be explicitly handled.

Potential issues:
One potential issue is that the plan does not specify how to initialize the dp table. This could be a problem if the initial values of the dp table affect the correctness of the solution. However, this is a common issue in dynamic programming problems and can often be addressed by initializing the dp table correctly.
