The bottom-up approach uses tabulation to fill up a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there are no paths to consider.
dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, where dp[0][j] = 0 for all j since there are no paths to consider.
dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, where the current element is taken from row i and column j.
Utilize a bottom-up approach by iterating over the grid in a top-down manner, updating the dp array at each step.
