===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

The state expression could be:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(n-1).

Memoizing the function that calculates the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts

Consider a base case, where i or j is 0. For example, dp[0][j] could be 0 if j is 0.
