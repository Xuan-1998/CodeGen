===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach uses tabulation to fill up a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there are no paths to consider.

dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, where dp[0][k] represents the base case for all k, meaning there's only one option (the topmost element) that doesn't depend on previous choices.

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, and let dp[i-1][k] be the state from the previous row. Then, we can consider taking the current element as the topmost element in the path or skipping it and continue from the previous row.

// Correctness: The plan seems to capture the essence of the problem correctly. It uses a bottom-up approach with tabulation, which is suitable for dynamic programming problems.

// Improvement: One potential improvement could be to consider memoization to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computations. This can improve the time complexity of the solution.

// Edge cases: The plan seems to handle edge cases correctly. For example, it sets dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, which is the base case when there are no paths to consider. It also considers taking the current element as the topmost element in the path or skipping it and continue from the previous row, which handles the case where we need to make a choice between including the current element in the path or not.

// Potential issues: One potential issue with the plan is that it doesn't explicitly handle the case where all elements are 0. In this case, the minimum sum of a falling path would be 0, but the plan might not correctly handle this case.
