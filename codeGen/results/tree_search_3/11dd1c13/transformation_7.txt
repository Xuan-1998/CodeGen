===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(sum(grid[k][min(j-1, n-1) for k in range(i)) + dp[i-1][min(j-1, n-1)]) for j in range(n)].
Define the transition relationships as: dp[i][0] = grid[i][0], dp[0][j] = 0, and dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for i > 0 and j > 0.

You can use a dictionary to memoize the intermediate results, where the key is a tuple (i, j) representing the state, and the value is the corresponding minimum sum.
