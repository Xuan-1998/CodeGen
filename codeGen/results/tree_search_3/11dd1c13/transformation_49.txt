===BEGIN PLAN===
The top-down approach uses memoization to store previously computed values in a dictionary memo where memo[(i, j)] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as memo[(0, j)] = 0 for all j.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k-1]*A[0:i+1][j-k], dp[i-1][k-1]*A[0:i][j-k]) for k in range(1, j+1) + A[i][j]. The base case is dp[0][j] = 0 for all j.

memo[(i, j)] = memo[(i-1, j-1)] + A[i][j] if i > 0 and j > 0 else 0

Create a dictionary to store previously computed values in the form of memo[(i, j)] = min(dp[i-1][k-1]*A[0:i+1][j-k], dp[i-1][k-1]*A[0:i][j-k]) for k in range(1, j+1) and memo[(i, 0)] = A[0][i] if i > 0 else 0.
