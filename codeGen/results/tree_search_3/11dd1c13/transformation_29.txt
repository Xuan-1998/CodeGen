===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach uses tabulation to fill up a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there are no paths to consider.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i-1 rows and last j-1 columns, plus the value at row i and column j.

Use a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] is initialized to infinity for all i and j, and then update each cell based on the minimum sum of the falling path considering all elements in the first i-1 rows and last j-1 columns plus the value at row i and column j.
