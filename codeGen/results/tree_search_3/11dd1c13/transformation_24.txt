===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

The base case would be when i = 0 or j = 0, in which case dp[i][j] would be the minimum element in that row/column. This is because there's only one choice for the top-leftmost cell, so it's simply the smallest value in the grid.

dp[0][j] = min(grid[k][j] for k in range(len(grid)))
dp[i][0] = min(grid[i][k] for k in range(len(grid[0])))

The transition relationship can be formulated as a tuple (i, j) where i represents the number of rows considered so far and j represents the number of columns considered so far. The minimum sum for the current state depends on the minimum sums of states (i-1, j), (i-1, j-1), and (i, j-1). This is because a falling path in the grid can be broken down into three parts: the top-leftmost part, which only has one choice; the bottom-rightmost part, which also only has one choice; and the middle part, which has choices from both above and to the left.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

Store intermediate results in a dictionary where the keys are the dynamic programming state tuples (i, j) and the values are the corresponding minimum sums.

dp_dict = {}

For edge cases, we need to consider what happens when i or j is 0. In this case, dp[i][j] would be calculated based on the base case.

For example, if i = 0, then dp[0][j] would be calculated as min(grid[k][j] for k in range(len(grid))), which is the smallest value in the grid. Similarly, if j = 0, then dp[i][0] would be calculated as min(grid[i][k] for k in range(len(grid[0]))), which is also the smallest value in the grid.
