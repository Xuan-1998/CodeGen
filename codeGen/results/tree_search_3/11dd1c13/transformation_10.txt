===BEGIN PLAN REVISION===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(j-1), and the base case is dp[0][j] = grid[0][j] for all j. This ensures that we only consider non-zero shifts when moving down the grid.

To handle the constraint that no two elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column, we can use a simple trick: whenever we update the state dp[i][j], we make sure that the last element considered in dp[i-1][k] is not in the k-th column of the current row i. This ensures that our path never has two elements in adjacent rows and the same column.

To avoid redundant computation, use memoization by storing the minimum sum of falling path in a dictionary and update it as you iterate through the grid. This can significantly reduce the time complexity of the algorithm.

It's also important to consider edge cases: what if the input grid is empty? Or what if all elements in the grid are the same? In these cases, we should return -99 or 0 respectively, since there is no possible falling path with non-zero shifts.

One potential issue with this plan is that it may not correctly handle the case where a row has only one element. In this case, the last element considered in dp[i-1][k] will be the same as the element in the current row i. To avoid this issue, we can add an additional check to ensure that we never consider the last element of the previous row in the computation for the current row.
