===BEGIN PLAN===
The top-down approach uses memoization to store previously computed values in a dictionary memo where memo[(i, j)] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as memo[(0, j)] = 0 for all j.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k-1]*A[0][k] for k in range(j)). The base case is dp[0][j] = A[0][j].

memo[(i, j)] = min(memo[(i-1, j)], memo[(i, j-1)]) + A[i][j]

Use a dictionary to store previously computed values with the key being a tuple of the current row and column indices, but with an additional condition that memo[(i, 0)] = memo[(0, j)] = 0 for all i and j
