===BEGIN PLAN===
The top-down approach uses memoization to store previously computed values in a dictionary memo where memo[(i, j)] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as memo[(0, j)] = 0 for all j.

Initialize dp array or memo dictionary to store previously computed values.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k-1]*A[0][k] for k in range(j)) + A[i][j]. The base case is dp[0][j] = A[0][j].

Memoize the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts by storing previously computed values in a dictionary, where the key is the current state and the value is the minimum sum considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

Handle edge cases: 
- If there's only one row or column, return the sum of all cells.
- If there are multiple rows but no columns, consider each row separately and choose the minimum sum.
- If there are multiple columns but no rows, consider each column separately and choose the minimum sum.
