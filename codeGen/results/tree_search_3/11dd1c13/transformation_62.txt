===BEGIN PLAN===
The top-down approach uses memoization to store previously computed values in a dictionary memo where memo[(i, j)] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as memo[(0, j)] = 0 for all j.
The state expression is dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + A[i][j]. The base case is dp[0][j] = 0 for all j.
The state can be a tuple (i, j) representing the current row number i and column number j.
Utilize a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns
