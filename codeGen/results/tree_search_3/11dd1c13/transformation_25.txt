===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

The base case would be when i or j is 0. In this case, dp[i][j] should be initialized to 0 because there's no need for non-zero shifts since we're not considering any elements.

dp[0][j] = 0
dp[i][0] = 0

For the transition relationship, you are correct that it depends on the minimum sums of states (i-1, j), (i-1, j-1), and (i, j-1). This is because we can either include or exclude the current row in our falling path. If we include the current row, we would have to consider the last column, hence dp[i][j]. If we exclude the current row, we could choose any element from the previous row, hence dp[i-1][j-1].

However, there's a potential issue with this plan. It doesn't handle the case when i and j are both greater than 0. In this case, we should consider whether including or excluding the current row gives us a smaller sum.

Another issue is that you didn't specify how to update dp[i][j] based on these three states. You could either use min function to get the smallest of these sums or manually calculate them.

The plan should also include edge cases, such as what happens when i or j becomes greater than the size of the grid.
