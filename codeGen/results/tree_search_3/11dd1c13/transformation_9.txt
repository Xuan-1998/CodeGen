===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k-1] + grid[i][k] for k from 0 to j if i > 0 and j >= 0), which ensures that we only consider non-zero shifts. The base case is dp[0][j] = grid[0][j] for all j, since the first row has no elements above it.

The plan seems correct in terms of capturing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts. However, there are some potential issues that should be considered:

* Edge cases: What if the input is a 1x1 grid? In this case, dp[0][j] would always be equal to grid[0][j], and we wouldn't need to consider any other states.
* Overlapping subproblems: The plan seems to handle overlapping subproblems correctly by considering all possible non-zero shifts. However, it's worth noting that the time complexity of this approach could be O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the size of the grid.

To improve the plan, we could consider a more efficient data structure for storing and updating the dynamic programming states. For example, we could use a priority queue to efficiently select the smallest possible shift at each step.

The plan does include edge cases: it correctly handles the base case where i = 0, and it ensures that only non-zero shifts are considered by iterating over k from 0 to j.
