===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach uses tabulation to fill up a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there are no paths to consider.
dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, where dp[0][k] represents the base case for all k, meaning there's only one option (the topmost element) that doesn't depend on previous choices.
Let dp[i][j] be the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, and let dp[i-1][k] be the state from the previous row. Then, we can consider taking the current element as the topmost element in the path or skipping it and continue from the previous row.
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j] for k in range(len(grid[0]))) if i > 0 else grid[0][j] for j in range(len(grid[0])))
