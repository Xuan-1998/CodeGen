===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1] if i > 0 and j > 0 else -99), and the base case is dp[0][j] = grid[0][j] for all j.

Treat each column as an independent dynamic programming subproblem, and consider a state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path considering all elements in the first i rows and jth column.

You are correct to think about treating each column as an independent problem. This is because for a given column, you can choose any element from that column, and the choice does not affect the choices made in previous or future columns.

However, there's one issue with your state expression: when i > 0 and j > 0, you should consider the minimum sum of falling paths ending at cells (i-1, j-1), (i-1, j), and (i, j-1). This is because a falling path can end at any of these three cells.

Another issue with your plan is that it does not account for non-zero shifts. You need to consider all possible shifts when choosing the next element in the falling path.

To fix this, you could modify your state expression to dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]. This way, you are considering all possible shifts and ending cells for a given cell (i, j).

Finally, you should also consider the edge cases. For example, what if i or j is 0? In this case, your state expression would need to be modified accordingly.

Overall, your plan is a good start, but it needs some modification to correctly account for non-zero shifts and all possible ending cells.
