===BEGIN PLAN===
The top-down approach uses memoization to store previously computed values in a dictionary memo where memo[(i, j)] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as memo[(0, j)] = 0 for all j.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k-1]*A[0][k-1] + A[i][j]) for k in range(1, m+1). The base case is dp[0][j] = 0 for all j.

dp[i] = min(dp[i-1][k-1] * A[i][k] + memo[(i-1, m-j)]) for k in range(1, m+1)
