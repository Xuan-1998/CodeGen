===BEGIN PLAN===
The top-down approach uses memoization to store previously computed values in a dictionary memo where memo[(i, j)] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as memo[(0, j)] = 0 for all j.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + A[i][j]. The base case is dp[0][j] = 0 for all j.

Consider dp[i][j] as the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.
Use dictionary memo = {i: {j: 0 for j in range(len(grid[0]))} for i in range(len(grid))}
