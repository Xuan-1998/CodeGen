===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.
dp[i][j] = min(sum(grid[k][j] for k in range(i)) + (i > 0 and j > 0 and dp[i-1][j-1]) or -99).
The transition relationship is that the minimum sum for the current state dp[i][j] depends on the minimum sums of states dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1], and dp[i][j-1].
Implement a bottom-up approach using nested loops and update dp[i][j] accordingly.
