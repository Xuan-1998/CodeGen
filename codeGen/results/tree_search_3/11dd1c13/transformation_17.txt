Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.
dp[i][j] = min(sum(grid[k][j] for k in range(i)) + (i > 0 and j > 0 and dp[i-1][j-1]) or -99).

Consider a dynamic programming state as the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts for all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, where i and j are the row and column indices respectively.
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][0], dp[0][j]) + grid[i][j]
