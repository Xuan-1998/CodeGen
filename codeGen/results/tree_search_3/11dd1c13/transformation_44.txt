===BEGIN FEEDBACK===
Your plan is generally correct, but there are some minor issues that need to be addressed.

Firstly, you're on the right track by using dynamic programming to solve this problem. The idea of filling up a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns is sound.

However, there's one minor issue: your recurrence relation seems to be missing a crucial detail. You're not considering the column shift constraint properly.

Recall that a falling path cannot have two adjacent paths in the same column. To reflect this constraint, you should consider all possible shifts when choosing the minimum sum from the previous row. This means that instead of just considering dp[i-1][j] and dp[i-1][min(k for k in range(j+1))], you should also consider the shift that is one position to the right of j.

Here's a revised version of your plan:
