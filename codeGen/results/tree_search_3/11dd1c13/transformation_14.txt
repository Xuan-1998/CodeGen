===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1] if i > 0 and j > 0 else -99), and the base case is dp[0][j] = grid[0][j] for all j.

Treat each column as an independent dynamic programming subproblem, and consider a state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path considering all elements in the first i rows and jth column.

Create a 2D table dp with dimensions len(grid), where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and jth column.

===END PLAN===
