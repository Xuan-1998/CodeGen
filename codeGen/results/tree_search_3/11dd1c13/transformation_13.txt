===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1] if i > 0 and j > 0 else -99), and the base case is dp[0][j] = grid[0][j] for all j.

Formulate the state expression dp[i][k] = min(dp[i-1][k], dp[i][k-1]) + grid[i][k].

Dynamically generate a list of tuples to represent the dynamic programming states and use the state expression to update the minimum sum.
