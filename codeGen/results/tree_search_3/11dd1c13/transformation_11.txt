===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

The state expression is correct: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1] if i > 0 and j > 0 else -99), which captures the idea that we can either include or exclude the current element from our path. The base case dp[0][j] = grid[0][j] for all j is also correct, as it represents the minimum sum of a falling path starting from the first row.

The recursive state expression dp[i][k] = min(dp[i-1][k], dp[i][k-1]) + grid[i][k] is also correct. It captures the idea that we can either include or exclude the current element, and then recursively consider the minimum sum of a falling path considering all elements in the first i-1 rows and last k-1 columns.

The plan suggests using a 2D array to store the dynamic programming states and fill it up from top-down, with base cases at the first row. This is correct, as we need to start filling up the dp table from the base case and then recursively fill in the rest of the table.

One potential issue with the plan is that it does not explicitly handle the edge case where i or j is 0. However, this can be easily handled by checking for these cases at the beginning of each recursive call and returning -99 if either i or j is 0.

The plan also correctly handles the non-zero shifts constraint by considering all possible paths that involve non-zero shifts.

Overall, the plan appears to be correct and should result in a correct solution to the problem.
