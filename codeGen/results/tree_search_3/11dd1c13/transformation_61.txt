===BEGIN PLAN===
The top-down approach uses memoization to store previously computed values in a dictionary memo where memo[(i, j)] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as memo[(0, j)] = 0 for all j.

The plan seems correct so far! Using memoization to store previously computed values will definitely help reduce the time complexity of the solution.

However, there are a few potential issues that might arise:

1. **Edge cases**: What happens when i or j is 0? The base case should handle this scenario correctly.
2. **State expression**: The state expression dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + A[i][j] seems correct, but it's essential to ensure that the state is indeed minimal for a falling path with non-zero shifts.

To improve the plan:

* **Consider the first row and last column separately**: Since there are no columns or rows above the topmost row or left of the leftmost column, these cases can be handled directly without needing memoization. This might simplify the overall algorithm.
* **Handle edge cases correctly**: As mentioned earlier, the base case should handle i or j being 0 correctly.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
