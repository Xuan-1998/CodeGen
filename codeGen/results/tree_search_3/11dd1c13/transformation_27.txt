===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach uses tabulation to fill up a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there are no paths to consider.

The plan seems correct so far! You're on the right track by using dynamic programming to solve this problem.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, where dp[0][j] = 0 for all j since there are no paths to consider.
This part is clear and concise. You're effectively describing what each cell in your table should represent.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, where the current element is taken from row i and column j.
This sentence could be rephrased for clarity. You might want to say something like "dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path that starts at cell [i][j]..." This would make it clearer what's being considered when calculating dp[i][j].

Consider using memoization with a dictionary to store previously computed values, reducing redundant computations.
This is a great idea! Memoization can be very helpful in dynamic programming problems where you need to avoid recomputing the same subproblems multiple times.
