===BEGIN PLAN===
The top-down approach uses memoization to store previously computed values in a dictionary memo where memo[(i, j)] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as memo[(0, j)] = 0 for all j.

The state expression dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k-1]*A[0][i-k+1] for k in range(j)). The base case is dp[0][j] = A[0][j].

However, this plan seems to be incorrect. The state transition equation does not correctly capture the falling path constraint. It seems that you are trying to compute the minimum sum of a falling path considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, but your equation is actually considering only the top row.

To fix this issue, we need to revisit the problem statement and try to come up with a correct state transition equation.

One way to do this is by using a bottom-up approach. We can start from the base case where memo[(0, 0)] = A[0][0] (the sum of the first element) and then update the values for larger i and j based on the constraints of the problem. For example, dp[i][j] could be equal to min(dp[i-1][k]*A[i][j] + memo[(i-1, k-1)] for k in range(j)).

We can also consider using a 2D array instead of a dictionary to store computed values, and update them accordingly as we iterate through the grid. This could help improve performance by avoiding slow lookups in the dictionary.
