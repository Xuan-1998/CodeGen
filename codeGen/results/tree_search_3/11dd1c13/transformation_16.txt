===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1] if i > 0 and j > 0 else -99), which seems correct as it considers the previous cell and the minimum sum of a falling path. However, there are some issues with this expression:

* The base case should be updated to dp[0][j] = grid[0][j] for all j.
* The state expression is not well-defined when i or j is 0.

Treat each column as an independent dynamic programming subproblem, and consider a state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path considering all elements in the first i rows and jth column. This approach seems correct as it separates the problem into smaller subproblems.

Implement tabulation by initializing dp[0][j] with the corresponding values from the grid, and then iteratively update each cell dp[i][j] based on the minimum sum of a falling path considering all elements in the first i-1 rows and jth column. This approach is correct as it uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.

To improve this plan, we should handle the edge cases correctly:

* When i or j is 0, update dp[i][j] based on the base case.
* When i > 0 and j > 0, update dp[i][j] based on the state expression.

The potential issues with this plan are:

* The state expression may not be well-defined when i or j is 0.
* The initialization of dp[0][j] should be handled correctly.

This plan includes edge cases:

* When i or j is 0, update dp[i][j] based on the base case.
* When i > 0 and j > 0, update dp[i][j] based on the state expression.

Overall, this plan seems correct but needs some adjustments to handle edge cases correctly.
