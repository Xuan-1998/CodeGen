===BEGIN FEEDBACK===
Your intuition to solve this problem using Dynamic Programming is correct. The top-down approach with memoization can be used to solve this problem.

The state expression you provided, dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k-1]*A[i][k] for k in range(1, j+1)) + A[i][j], seems correct. It calculates the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

The base case you provided, memo[(0, j)] = 0 for all j, is also correct. This represents the base case where there are no more rows to consider.

However, I have some concerns about the memoization approach you described:

* The state expression you provided seems to be calculating the minimum sum of a falling path considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. But what if we can find a shorter sub-path that achieves the same result? This could lead to incorrect results.
* The base case you provided is correct, but it's not clear how memo[(i, j)] = 0 for i > 0 and j > 0 will be used to calculate the minimum sum of a falling path.

To improve this plan, I would suggest using a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming. This would involve initializing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. Then, we can fill up the dp array row by row from top to down.

Here's an updated plan:
