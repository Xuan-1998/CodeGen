===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

The first line seems to be trying to calculate the minimum sum for the current cell by considering all possible paths ending at that cell. However, this line doesn't seem to take into account the constraint that no two elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column. This could lead to incorrect results if the grid has a significant number of repeated columns.

A better approach would be to consider only the cells from previous rows and previous columns that do not share any columns with the current cell. For example, for the cell at the bottom-right corner, you should only consider the cells above it in the same column or the cells to its left (but not both). This way, you ensure that no two elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column.

dp[i][j] = min(sum(grid[k][j] for k in range(i)) + (i > 0 and j > 0 and dp[i-1][j-1]) or -99).

The second line seems to be trying to calculate the minimum sum by considering all possible paths ending at each cell. However, this line doesn't seem to take into account the constraint that no two elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column.

A better approach would be to consider only the cells from previous rows and previous columns that do not share any columns with the current cell, as mentioned earlier. This way, you ensure that no two elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column.

dp[i][j] = min(max(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(j)) + grid[i][j] for j in range(len(grid[0])))
