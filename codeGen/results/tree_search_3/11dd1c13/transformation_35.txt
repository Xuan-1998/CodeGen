===BEGIN PLAN ANALYSIS AND FEEDBACK===
Your plan seems to be heading in the right direction, using dynamic programming with tabulation. However, I'd like to highlight a few points that might improve it or potential issues that you should consider:

1. **Base case**: You mentioned dp[0][j] = 0 for all j as the base case. This is correct, but you also need to clarify what this represents in terms of the problem statement (i.e., what is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering only the topmost row?).

2. **State transition**: Your plan mentions dp[i-1][k] representing the state from the previous row. This means that you need to explain how this state affects the current cell's value (i.e., what is the relationship between dp[i-1][k] and dp[i][j]?).

3. **Edge cases**: You should consider edge cases, such as a 1x1 grid or an empty grid. How will your plan handle these scenarios? Should you add specific base cases for these cases?

4. **Non-zero shifts**: The problem statement mentions "non-zero shifts." You might want to think about how this affects the dynamic programming approach. For example, do non-zero shifts mean that you can skip rows or columns in certain situations? How will you incorporate this constraint into your plan?

5. **Grid size**: Your plan doesn't specify any limitations on the grid size (e.g., number of rows and columns). Make sure to consider what happens when the grid size increases, as this might impact performance or lead to incorrect results.

6. **Cell values**: You didn't mention anything about handling cell values in your plan. How will you determine the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns?

7. **Optimizations**: Depending on the specific implementation, you might want to consider optimizations such as memoization or caching.
