===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach uses tabulation to fill up a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there are no paths to consider.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i-1 rows and last j-1 columns, plus the value at row i and column j.

**Issue:** The plan doesn't specify how to handle the case when i == 0 or j == 0. We need to clarify what dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] represent in this context.

To improve the plan:

* **Memoization:** Your idea of using a dictionary memo to store the values of dp[i][j] is correct. This can help reduce computation time by avoiding redundant calculations.
* **Initialization:** We need to specify how to initialize the dp table, especially when i == 0 or j == 0.

To address potential issues:

* **Edge cases:** You're right that we need to handle edge cases when i == 0 or j == 0. This will help us avoid undefined behavior.
* **Recursion vs iteration:** While your plan suggests a recursive approach, it's also possible to solve this problem using iteration. We should consider both approaches and determine which one is more efficient.

Here's the updated plan:
