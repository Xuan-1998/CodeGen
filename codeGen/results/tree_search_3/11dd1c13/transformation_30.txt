===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach uses tabulation to fill up a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. 
The base case can be considered as dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there are no paths to consider.
dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, where dp[0][j] = 0 for all j since there are no paths to consider.

The key insight here is that we only care about the minimum sum of a falling path that starts from row i and column j. We don't need to consider any other cells in the table.
This plan correctly captures this intuition. However, it can be improved by using a more efficient way to calculate dp[i][j].

One possible improvement is to use a top-down approach with memoization, where we store the minimum sum of a falling path that starts from cell (i, j) and then reuse this value whenever we need to consider the same cell.

This plan does not explicitly include edge cases. However, it is correct in assuming that the base case is dp[0][j] = 0 for all j.
One potential issue with this plan is that it assumes that the input grid is a perfect square (i.e., its side length is a perfect square). If this assumption does not hold true for certain inputs, then we would need to add additional logic to handle these edge cases.

Overall, your plan is correct and well-reasoned. It correctly captures the intuition behind the problem and provides a clear roadmap for how to solve it.
