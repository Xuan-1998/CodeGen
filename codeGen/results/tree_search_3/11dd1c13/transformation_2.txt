===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

The state expression dp[i][j] = min(sum(grid[k][min(j-1, n-1)] for k in range(i)) + dp[i-1][min(j-1, n-1)]) for j in range(n)

This plan is correct in identifying the problem as a dynamic programming problem and attempting to define the state and transition function. However, there are some potential issues with this plan:

* The state expression seems to be overcomplicating things. It's not entirely clear what the intention is behind taking the minimum of the sum of elements in the first i rows and last j columns, and then adding that to dp[i-1][min(j-1, n-1)].

A potential improvement could be to simplify the state expression and focus on finding the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

* The plan does not explicitly consider edge cases. For example, what happens when i or j is 0? How will the dynamic programming table be initialized?

A potential improvement could be to add explicit consideration for these edge cases.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
