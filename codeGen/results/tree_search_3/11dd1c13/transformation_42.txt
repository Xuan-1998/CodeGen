===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach uses tabulation to fill up a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there are no paths to consider.

dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, where dp[0][k] represents the base case for all k, meaning there's only one option (the topmost element) that doesn't depend on previous choices.

dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, where dp[i-1][k] represents the state from the previous row. The transition relationship can be formulated as taking the minimum between the current element's value and skipping it.

First, initialize the table:
dp = [[0 for _ in range(len(grid[0]))] for _ in range(len(grid))]

Then, fill up the table:
for i in range(1, len(grid)+1):
    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k-1] + grid[i][k], dp[i-1][k]) for k in range(1, len(grid[0])+1)]

Finally, find the minimum sum of the falling path with non-zero shifts:
min_sum = float('inf')
for j in range(len(grid[0])):
    min_sum = min(min_sum, dp[-1][j])
return min_sum
