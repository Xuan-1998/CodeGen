===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

The state expression is not entirely accurate. The correct state expression should consider the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts that ends at position (i, j) and continues from the next row.

Formulate the state expression as dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][min(j-1, n-1)] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(max(0, i-1)).

To handle edge cases:
* Initialize the first row of the dynamic programming table to be equal to the corresponding elements in the grid. This is because there are no previous rows to consider when calculating the minimum sum of a falling path.
* The last column of the dynamic programming table should always be equal to the corresponding elements in the grid, as there are no next columns to consider.

The plan does not include edge cases. To handle edge cases:
