===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach uses tabulation to fill up a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there are no paths to consider.

The plan seems correct so far! You're thinking about using dynamic programming to solve this problem, which is a great approach.

However, I do have some suggestions to improve the plan:

1. It would be helpful to clarify what you mean by "non-zero shifts". Are we only considering paths that move diagonally (i.e., one row and one column) or are there other types of shifts as well?

2. You didn't specify how to initialize the dp table. For example, what should dp[0][j] be initialized to? Should it just be 0 for all j, or is there a specific calculation that needs to be done?

3. The recurrence relation you provided seems correct: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + arr[i][j]) for k ranging from 0 to n-1. However, I would suggest adding some more context or clarification on what this recurrence is supposed to represent.

4. It's not entirely clear how the plan handles edge cases (e.g., when i = 0, j = 0). Do we just set dp[0][0] to 0 and then build up from there? Or are there specific edge cases that need to be handled separately?

5. Finally, it would be helpful to clarify what exactly the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts represents. Is it the smallest possible sum, or is there some other constraint we need to satisfy?
