===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a tuple (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

dp[i][j] = min(sum(grid[k][j] for k in range(i)) + 
               ((i > 0) and (j > 0) and dp[i-1][j-1]) or -99)

Dynamic programming state can be formulated as a tuple (i, j) where i represents the number of rows considered so far and j represents the number of columns considered so far. The transition relationship is that the minimum sum for the current state depends on the minimum sums of states (i-1, j), (i-1, j-1), and (i, j-1).

Use a 2D array to store dynamic programming states as you fill them in from the top down and left to right.

The plan seems correct. The dynamic programming state dp[i][j] is well-defined. The transition relationship captures the dependencies between adjacent states correctly.

To improve the plan, consider adding base cases for when i or j is 0. This will handle edge cases where there are no rows or columns left to consider.

Some potential issues with the plan include:

* What happens if the minimum sum of a state is not actually possible? You might need to add some kind of "impossible" value to represent this, like -inf.
* How do you handle the case where there are multiple minimum sums for a given state?

The plan does include edge cases. For example, when i or j is 0, the dp[i][j] should be set to the sum of all elements in the corresponding row or column.

Overall, this seems like a good start for a dynamic programming solution.
