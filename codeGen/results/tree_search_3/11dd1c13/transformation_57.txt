===BEGIN PLAN===
The top-down approach uses memoization to store previously computed values in a dictionary memo where memo[(i, j)] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as memo[(0, j)] = 0 for all j.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k-1]*A[0][i-1] + A[i][k] for k in range(1, j+1)). The base case is dp[0][j] = A[0][j].

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][0] + min(A[i][k]*dp[i-1][k+1] for k in range(j-1))

Employ a recursive function with memoization to avoid redundant computations and store previously computed values in a dictionary.
