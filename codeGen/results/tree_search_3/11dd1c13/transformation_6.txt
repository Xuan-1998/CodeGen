===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

The state expression is not entirely clear, but based on your intuition, it seems like you're trying to capture the minimum sum of a falling path that ends at cell (i, j). If that's correct, then the state expression could be rewritten as:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(min(j-1, n-1))

This is because we want to consider all possible choices of cells from the previous row (i.e., dp[i-1][0] to dp[i-1][min(j-1, n-1)]) and add the current cell value to get the minimum sum.

Define the transition relationships as:

dp[i][0] = grid[i][0]
dp[0][j] = 0
for i > 0 and j > 0: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j]) for k in range(min(j-1, n-1))

These relationships seem correct, but it's worth noting that the base case dp[0][j] = 0 might not be entirely accurate. A falling path can't start from a middle row, so we should consider only the first row (i.e., i == 0) and last column (i.e., j == n-1).

You can use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming states, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

One potential issue is that the plan doesn't explicitly handle edge cases. For example, what if the input grid has only one row or column? In such cases, we would need to adjust our state expression and transition relationships accordingly.

Overall, your plan seems correct, but it's always a good idea to double-check and refine your thinking as you implement the solution.
