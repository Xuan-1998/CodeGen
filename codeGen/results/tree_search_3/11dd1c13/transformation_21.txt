===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming state as a pair (i, j) representing the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns.

dp[i][j] is initially set to infinity for all i, j. The base case is when i or j is 0, in which case dp[i][j] = 0.

The transition relationship is that the minimum sum for the current state dp[i][j] depends on the minimum sums of states dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1], and dp[i][j-1]. This is because a falling path can either end at row i, in which case it would be the minimum sum of all elements in that row, or it could end at column j, in which case it would be the minimum sum of all elements in that column.

dp[i][j] = min(sum(grid[k][j] for k in range(i)) + (i > 0 and j > 0 and dp[i-1][j-1]) or -99).

Apply memoization by storing the minimum sums in a dictionary with tuple keys. This is because the same subproblem may be solved multiple times, and memoization can avoid this redundancy.

Finally, return dp[m][n], where m and n are the number of rows and columns in the grid respectively. This is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the grid.
