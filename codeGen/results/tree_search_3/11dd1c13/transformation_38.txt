===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach uses tabulation to fill up a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there are no paths to consider.

dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, where dp[0][k] represents the base case for all k, meaning there's only one option (the topmost element) that doesn't depend on previous choices.

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, and let dp[i-1][k] be the state from the previous row. Then, we can consider taking the current element as the topmost element in the path or skipping it and continue from the previous row.

The plan looks good so far! However, I'd like to clarify a few points:

* You mentioned "non-zero shifts", but you didn't specify what that means exactly. Are you considering all possible shifts (1, 2, ..., n-1), where n is the number of rows? Or are there specific restrictions on the shifts?
* In the recurrence relation, I'm not seeing a clear specification of how to handle the case when the current element is included in the path versus when it's skipped. You might want to elaborate on that part.
* What's the stopping condition for filling up the dp table? Is it when we reach the top row (i.e., i = 0), or is there a specific condition based on the grid size?
* Have you considered any edge cases, such as an empty grid or a single-element grid?

To improve the plan, I'd suggest breaking down the recurrence relation into more explicit steps. For example, you could consider two cases: when including the current element and when skipping it. This would help clarify the logic behind the dp table filling.

Overall, your plan looks promising! With some refinement, it should be a solid foundation for solving the problem.
