===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach uses tabulation to fill up a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there are no paths to consider.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, where dp[0][j] = 0 for all j since there are no paths to consider.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + arr[i][j]) for k ranging from 0 to n-1
Use memoization to store the intermediate results in a dictionary.
