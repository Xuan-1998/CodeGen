===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach uses tabulation to fill up a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there are no paths to consider.
dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns, where dp[0][j] = min(grid[0][k]) for 0 <= k < j as there's only one option (the topmost element) that doesn't depend on previous choices.
dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][min(k for k in range(j+1))])
Use a dictionary to store the memoized values and update them recursively.
