===BEGIN PLAN===
The top-down approach uses memoization to store previously computed values in a dictionary memo where memo[(i, j)] is the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts considering all elements in the first i rows and last j columns. The base case can be considered as memo[(0, j)] = 0 for all j.

The state expression dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k-1]*A[0][k] for k in range(j)) is not entirely correct. It seems that you're trying to find the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts, but your expression doesn't quite capture this. A more accurate state expression could be dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k]*A[i][k] for k in range(j) if i-1 != j).

The base case dp[0][j] = 0 is correct.

The recurrence relation memo[(i, j)] = min(memo[(i-1, j)], memo[(i, j-1)]) + A[i][j] seems to be a good start. However, you need to ensure that the values in memo are calculated correctly.

To avoid calculating the same value multiple times, it's essential to initialize the dictionary with default values for i or j being 0. This can be done by initializing memo[(i, j)] = dp[i][j] = float('inf') for all (i, j) where i > 0 and/or j > 0.

The plan seems to handle edge cases correctly, but it would be beneficial to include a check to ensure that the input grid is a square (i.e., each row has the same number of elements).
