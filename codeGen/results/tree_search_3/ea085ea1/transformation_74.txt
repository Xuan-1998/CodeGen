===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using sliding window approach: Create a sliding window that moves along the strings str1 and str2, and check for each substring within the window whether it is common between the two strings. Then keep track of the maximum number of such substrings found so far.
The state could be the current position in both strings, with the base case being when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string.

state
Create a 1D array to keep track of the length of common suffixes for each substring, then use this information to determine the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings.
