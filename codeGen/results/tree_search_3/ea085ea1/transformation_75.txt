===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming with Sliding Window approach: Create a sliding window that moves along the strings str1 and str2, and check for each substring within the window whether it is common between the two strings. Then keep track of the maximum number of such substrings found so far.

The state could be the current position in both strings, with the base case being when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string.
Let's define the state as: dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found up to position i in str1 and j in str2.

Here are some potential improvements:

* Instead of checking each substring within the window, we can use a suffix tree or suffix array data structure to efficiently find all common substrings.
* We should also keep track of the length of the longest common substring found so far. This is because we want to maximize the number of non-overlapping common substrings.

Some potential edge cases to consider:

* What if one string is a prefix of another? In this case, we can't count any substrings that are longer than the difference in lengths between the two strings.
* What if all characters in both strings are the same? In this case, the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings would be equal to the length of the shorter string.
