===BEGIN FEEDBACK AND IMPROVEMENTS==='
Your initial plan is a good start, but there are some potential issues to consider:

1. The sliding window approach might not be the most efficient way to solve this problem, especially when dealing with strings of length N. A more optimized approach could be using dynamic programming with memoization.
2. The state definition is unclear. It would be better to define the state as a tuple (i, j) representing the current positions in str1 and str2.
3. The transition relationship might not be correctly formulated. You should check if the substring from indices i to j in both strings is common before transitioning the state.

Here's an updated plan:

===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
Create a dynamic programming table dp of size (N+1) x (N+1), where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of non-overlapping common substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j].

State: (i, j)
Base case: dp[0][0] = 0

Transition relationship:

- If str1[i-1] == str2[j-1], then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
- Else, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

Memoization: Store the results of subproblems in a dictionary dp_dict where the key is the state (i, j) and the value is the result.

Maximize dp[N][N]

This plan avoids potential issues by using dynamic programming with memoization and correctly defining the state and transition relationship.
