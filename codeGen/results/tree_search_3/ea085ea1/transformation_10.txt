===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming: The problem can be solved by considering all possible substrings of str1 and checking if they are present in str2, then use a 2D array to keep track of the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far.
The state expression is dp[i][j] = 1 if the substring from i to i+1 in str1 matches a non-overlapping substring from j to j+1 in str2, otherwise it's 0.
dp[i][j] = 1 if the character at index i in str1 matches the character at index j in str2, and the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far is dp[i-1][j-1]
Implement a top-down recursive function with memoization using a dictionary to store the computed states
