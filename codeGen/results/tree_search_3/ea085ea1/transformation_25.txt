===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization: Create a memoization table where each cell represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for two given strings. Fill this table by iterating over all possible substrings and checking if they are present in both input strings, then use this table to find the solution at the end.

Define the state expression as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. The base case is when i == j = 0, then the answer is 0.

Define a 2D array memo[N+1][N+1] where memo[i][j] stores the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. Use dynamic programming to fill up the memoization table by considering all possible substrings. The state expression is also dp[i][j], which represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between two given strings.

Implement a function to recursively calculate the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between two given strings, and use this function to fill up the memoization table.
