===BEGIN FEEDBACK AND IMPROVEMENTS===
Your initial plan is on the right track, but there are a few potential issues and areas for improvement:
1. The sliding window approach might not be the most efficient way to solve this problem. Instead, consider using dynamic programming with a 2D table, as you mentioned.
2. The state could be refined further to keep track of the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far for each position in both strings.
3. Edge cases should also be considered: what happens if one string is longer than the other? What about empty strings?
4. To improve performance, consider pre-processing the input strings to create a hash table or Trie data structure that can quickly look up common substrings.

Here's an updated plan incorporating these ideas:
