===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with a sliding window approach.

The idea is to create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found up until indices i and j in both strings str1 and str2. The state could be the current position in both strings, with the base case being when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string.

Here's how we can implement this plan:

* Initialize a 2D array dp of size (N+1) x (N+1) where N is the length of each input string.
* Fill the base case: For i from 0 to N, and j from 0 to N, if either i or j reaches the end of its respective string, then set dp[i][j] = 0, because there are no more substrings to consider.

Now, we need to figure out how to transition from one state to another. We can do this by considering all possible substrings within the current window and see if they match between str1 and str2.

* For i from 1 to N, and j from 1 to N, consider the substring str1[i-1..i] and str2[j-1..j]. If these two substrings are common (i.e., equal), then we can increment a counter of common non-overlapping substrings.
* Update dp[i][j] by adding this counter value.

This way, at each step, we're considering all possible substrings within the current window and see if they match between str1 and str2. This allows us to efficiently build up our dynamic programming table.

Finally, when we reach the end of either string (i.e., i or j reaches N), we just need to return the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far.
