Your plan seems to be a good start, but there are a few areas where it can be improved.

Firstly, instead of using a sliding window approach, I think it would be more efficient to use dynamic programming. You could create a 2D array dp[][] where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring str1[:i+1] and str2[:j+1] are common or not. This way, you can avoid redundant calculations.

Secondly, your base case is correct - when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string, there's no more to check. However, you might want to also include a case where the current characters at both positions are different. In this case, you would need to reset the state and start checking again from the next position.

Thirdly, your idea about memoizing the function that checks whether two given substrings are equal is excellent! This can greatly reduce the number of computations needed.

Lastly, I think you should also consider edge cases where one string is a substring of the other. In this case, the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings would be the length of the shorter string minus 1 (because you can't have overlapping substrings).

Overall, your plan seems to be on the right track. It just needs a bit more refinement to make it efficient and correct.
