===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming with a sliding window approach.

1. Create two arrays dp1 and dp2, each of size N+1, where dp[i] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings of length i found so far in str1 and str2 respectively.
2. Initialize dp1[0] = 0 and dp2[0] = 0.
3. Iterate over the strings str1 and str2 from left to right, keeping a sliding window of size i.
4. For each substring within the window:
    - Check if it is common between str1 and str2 (i.e., the substring appears at the same position in both strings).
    - If it is, increment dp1[i] by 1 and update the maximum number of common substrings found so far.
5. Use memoization to store previously computed states:
    - Create a dictionary memo where the keys are tuples (i, j) representing the state of the current window in str1 and str2 respectively.
    - Initialize memo[(0, 0)] = 0, which represents the base case: no common substrings found so far.

Potential issues with the plan:
- The plan assumes that all characters in the strings belong to one of three categories (* or # or @), but it does not account for any edge cases. For example, what if there are multiple occurrences of the same character in the strings? How would we handle this?

How can it be improved:
- We could add more constraints on the length of the common substrings. For instance, only consider substrings of a certain minimum length.
- Use a more efficient data structure for memoization to reduce the time complexity.

Edge cases: 
- What if one or both strings are empty? How would we handle this?
- What if there is a single character in one string that does not appear in the other string? Would it still count as a common substring?

This plan can be improved by considering these edge cases and adding more constraints on the length of the common substrings.
