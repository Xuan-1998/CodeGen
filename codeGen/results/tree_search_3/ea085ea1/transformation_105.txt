Your initial plan is correct in that it involves using dynamic programming to solve this problem. You are right to recognize that you can use a sliding window approach to find common substrings between str1 and str2.

The state you proposed, dp[i][j], where i is the length of the current substring in str1 and j is the length of the current substring in str2, representing whether the substrings are common, is also correct. This state can be used to build up the solutions for smaller subproblems and update the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far.

However, you may want to consider a few potential issues with your plan:

1. You will need to handle the base case where the length of the current substring in str1 or str2 is 0. In this case, there are no common substrings, so dp[i][j] should be set to False.

2. You may want to consider edge cases where str1 and/or str2 contain repeated characters. This could affect how you calculate whether two substrings are the same.

3. Another issue is that you will need to ensure that your state transition function accurately captures the relationship between dp[i][j] and dp[i-1][j-1]. For example, if dp[i][j] is True, then it means that the substring of length i in str1 and the substring of length j in str2 are common. Then you can use this information to update dp[i-1][j-1], which would represent whether the substrings of length i-1 in str1 and j-1 in str2 are also common.

4. Finally, you should make sure that your dynamic programming algorithm correctly handles cases where there are multiple maximal lengths for common non-overlapping substrings between str1 and str2. Your algorithm should be able to handle these cases by returning the maximum number of such substrings found so far.
