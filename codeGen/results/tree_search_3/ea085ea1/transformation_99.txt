===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming with Sliding Window approach: 
Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring from index i to j in str1 and str2 are common. 

Then, create another 2D array max_common_substr_count where max_common_substr_count[i][j] stores the maximum number of common substrings found so far when the window ends at position (i,j) in both strings.

The state could be the current position in both strings, with the base case being when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string. 

max_common_substr_count
Implement a Sliding Window approach and keep track of the maximum number of common substrings found so far.
To calculate max_common_substr_count[i][j], you would compare the substring from (i-1) to j in str1 with the substring from (k-1) to j in str2 for k = 0 to i. 
If the substrings match, then update dp[i][j] and increment max_common_substr_count[i][j]. 

The final answer would be stored at max_common_substr_count[N-1][N-1], where N is the length of each string.
