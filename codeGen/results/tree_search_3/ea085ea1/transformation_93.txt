===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming, specifically by implementing a sliding window approach with tabulation.

Step 1: Initialize the state
Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i+1] and str2[:j+1]. The base case is when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string (i.e., i == N or j == N).

Step 2: Fill up the dp table
For each position (i, j) in the dp table:
    - If the current character in str1 at index i is not equal to the current character in str2 at index j, set dp[i][j] to be the maximum of dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1].
    - Otherwise, increment the count by 1 for the common substring ending at positions (i-1, j-1) and set dp[i][j] to this count.
Step 3: Return the maximum count
The maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1 and str2 is stored in the bottom-right corner of the dp table. Return this value.
