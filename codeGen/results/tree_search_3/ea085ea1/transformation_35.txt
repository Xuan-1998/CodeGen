===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization: Create a memoization table where each cell represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for two given strings. Fill this table by iterating over all possible substrings and checking if they are present in both input strings, then use this table to find the solution at the end.
Define the state expression as a set of tuples (i, j) representing the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. The base case is when i == j = 0, then the answer is an empty set.

This part looks good! You're on the right track by defining a memoization table to store the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for each substring pair. The base case makes sense, as there are no common substrings when both strings are empty.

Define the state expression as a set of tuples (i, j) representing the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. Then define the transition relationships based on whether the current character in str1 is the same as the current character in str2 or not.
Create a dictionary to store the dynamic programming table, where each key represents a substring of both input strings and its corresponding value is the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for that substring.

Here's where things get a bit unclear. You mention defining transition relationships based on whether the current character in str1 is the same as the current character in str2 or not. However, you don't specify how these relationships would be used to fill up the memoization table. Additionally, you only mention storing the dynamic programming table in a dictionary, but it's unclear what this dictionary represents.

To improve your plan, I'd suggest being more specific about how the transition relationships would be used to fill up the memoization table. You might also want to consider defining a recurrence relation that describes how the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between two strings depends on the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between smaller prefixes of these strings.

As for potential issues with your plan, one thing that stands out is that you don't seem to have an explicit way to handle overlapping substrings. For example, if a substring appears multiple times in both input strings, would it be counted as separate occurrences or only once? You might want to consider adding some additional logic to handle this case.

Finally, your plan doesn't explicitly cover edge cases such as when one of the input strings is empty or when both strings are identical. You might want to add some special cases to handle these scenarios.

Overall, I think you're on the right track with a dynamic programming approach, but you might need to flesh out some of the details and consider additional edge cases.
