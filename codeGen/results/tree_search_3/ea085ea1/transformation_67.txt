===BEGIN ANALYSIS===
Your initial intuition about this problem being related to Dynamic Programming is correct. The problem can indeed be solved using a sliding window approach.

The plan you've outlined so far seems good, but let me provide some additional suggestions and potential improvements:

* You're on the right track by creating a sliding window that moves along both strings. This will allow you to efficiently check for common substrings.
* Your state idea is also correct - keeping track of the current position in both strings will help you keep track of which substrings have been checked so far.
* Memoizing the function that checks if two strings are equal is a great optimization step. This will avoid redundant calculations and improve overall performance.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

* You might want to consider using a 2D array (or matrix) to store your memoization values. This would allow you to efficiently look up previously calculated values.
* When checking if two strings are equal, make sure you're considering substrings of all lengths, not just the same length. This will ensure that you catch common substrings of varying lengths.
* You might also want to consider some edge cases - for example, what happens if one of the input strings is shorter than the other? Do you need to handle this case separately?

As for potential issues with your plan:

* One thing to watch out for is ensuring that your sliding window doesn't get stuck in an infinite loop. Make sure you're properly handling the base case when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string.
* Another potential issue could be dealing with cases where two strings are identical (i.e., they have the same characters, just not necessarily in the same order). You might need to handle this case separately to avoid counting the entire string as a common substring.

Overall, your plan looks solid, and with some minor tweaks and optimizations, you should be able to write an efficient solution. Keep up the good work! ===END ANALYSIS===
