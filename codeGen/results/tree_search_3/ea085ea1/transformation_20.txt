===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization: Create a memoization table where each cell represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for two given strings. Fill this table by iterating over all possible substrings and checking if they are present in both input strings, then use this table to find the solution at the end.

Define the state expression as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. The base case is when i == j = 0, then the answer is 0.

Create a DP table dp[i][j] to store the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. The state expression is dp[i][j], which represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between two given strings. Fill this table by iterating over all possible substrings and checking if they are present in both input strings, then use this table to find the solution at the end.

However, there's a potential issue with this plan: it doesn't consider the overlapping part of the substrings. In this problem, we need to consider non-overlapping substrings, so we should only count the maximum number of substrings that do not overlap each other.

To improve this plan, we can iterate over all possible substrings in both str1 and str2, and for each substring, check if it's present in the other string without overlapping with previously found substrings. We can use a set to keep track of the already found substrings to avoid counting the same substring multiple times.

As for edge cases, we should consider strings of length 0 or less, as well as strings that are equal or have no common substrings.
