===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using sliding window approach: Create a sliding window that moves along the strings str1 and str2, and check for each substring within the window whether it is common between the two strings. Then keep track of the maximum number of such substrings found so far.
The state could be the length of the current common substring, with the base case being a substring of length 0.

state: (i, j) where i is the length of the current common substring in str1 and j is the length of the current common substring in str2
Tabulation using a 2D table to store intermediate results
