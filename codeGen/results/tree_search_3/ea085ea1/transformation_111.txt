===BEGIN FEEDBACK===
Your plan looks promising, but I do have some suggestions for improvement.

The sliding window approach can be effective, especially when you consider that the problem only asks for non-overlapping substrings. This means you don't need to worry about counting overlapping substrings.

However, your transition relationship could be improved. Instead of just storing the length of each new common substring, consider using a dictionary to store all common substrings found so far. This will allow you to efficiently check whether a given substring is already in the set of common substrings.

Regarding edge cases, it's worth noting that your plan doesn't explicitly handle strings with different lengths (N). You may want to add a condition to ensure that both str1 and str2 have the same length before processing them.

Another potential issue is that you're not considering the possibility of duplicate substrings. For example, if "abc" and "abcd" are common substrings, your plan might count each one separately. To address this, you could use a set to keep track of unique substrings.

Here's an updated version of your plan:
