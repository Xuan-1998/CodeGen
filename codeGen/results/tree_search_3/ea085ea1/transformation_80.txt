Your initial plan shows good intuition towards solving the problem, and I'll help you refine it further.

1. **Sliding Window Approach**: Your idea to create a sliding window that moves along the strings str1 and str2 is spot on! This approach can efficiently find common non-overlapping substrings.
2. **State**: The state you proposed, which tracks the current position in both strings, makes sense as the base case should be when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string.

However, to fully utilize dynamic programming, we need to incorporate a crucial aspect: **Memoization**. This will help avoid redundant computation and optimize the solution.

Here's an updated plan that incorporates memoization:
