===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming, specifically with a sliding window approach.

The idea is to create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found up to position i in str1 and j in str2. The state could be the set of all common substrings found so far, with the base case being an empty set.

The transition relationship can be formulated as follows: if the current characters in both strings match, then the state transitions from dp[i-1][j-1] to dp[i][j], indicating that a common substring has been found; otherwise, there is no transition. This means that when we find a matching character at positions i and j, we update the value of dp[i][j] based on the values of dp[i-1][j-1].

To use a sliding window approach, iterate through the strings from left to right, updating the table cells as you go along. For each cell dp[i][j], check if the characters at positions i in str1 and j in str2 match. If they do, then update the value of dp[i][j] based on the values of dp[i-1][j-1].
