===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming (DP): Create a DP table that stores the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far for each position in both strings, with the base case being when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string.

left_str1_pos

Create a 2D array to store the DP table, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found up to position i in str1 and j in str2. The base case is when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string (i.e., i == N or j == N).

To fill the DP table, iterate over all possible substrings within the window defined by the current positions [i, j]. For each substring, check if it is common between str1 and str2. If it is, increment the count in dp[i][j].

Finally, return the maximum value in the DP table, which represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found.
