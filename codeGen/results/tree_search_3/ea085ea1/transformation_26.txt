===BEGIN FEEDBACK===
The overall approach you have taken is correct, using dynamic programming to solve this problem.

One potential issue with your plan is that you are proposing three different approaches (Memoization, 2D array dp[i][j], and 3D array dp[i][j][k]) without clarifying which one is the most promising or efficient. It would be better to focus on a single approach and make sure it is correct before moving on.

Another issue with your plan is that you are not considering edge cases, such as when str1 and str2 have different lengths, or when they contain no common substrings. You should consider these edge cases in your solution.

Here's a refined version of your plan:

Define the state expression as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. The base case is when i == j = 0, then the answer is 0.

Create a memoization table dp[i][j] to store the results of subproblems. Fill this table by iterating over all possible substrings and checking if they are present in both input strings.

To avoid unnecessary computations, fill the table in a bottom-up manner. Start from the base case and work your way up to larger values of i and j.

Finally, use this memoization table to find the solution at the end.
