Your plan seems to be on the right track, using dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem.

The idea of creating a memoization table where each cell represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for two given strings is a good approach. 

I like how you've defined the state expression as a set of tuples (i, j) representing the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. The base case when i == j = 0 is also well-defined.

However, I think there might be some confusion about how to fill this table. You mentioned iterating over all possible substrings and checking if they are present in both input strings, but this doesn't seem like the most efficient approach.

One potential issue with your plan is that it might not correctly handle edge cases such as when str1 or str2 contains repeated characters. 

To improve your plan, I would suggest considering a different approach to filling the memoization table. For example, you could iterate over each character in both strings and update the memoization table based on whether the current characters match.

I think it's also important to consider edge cases more explicitly in your plan. For example, what happens if one of the input strings is an empty string? What if they are the same length but contain different characters?

Overall, I think your plan has some good ideas, and with a few tweaks, it could be a viable approach.
