===BEGIN FEEDBACK===
Your plan seems to be a good starting point for solving this problem using Dynamic Programming. You correctly identified that you need to consider all possible substrings of str1 and check if they are present in str2.

However, there are a few potential issues with the plan:
- The state expression dp[i][j] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far when considering all substrings ending at index i in str1 and j in str2. This does not take into account whether the substrings are non-overlapping.
- The update rule dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(min(i, j))) + (str1[i] == str2[j]) is also incorrect because it only considers one common substring at a time and does not ensure that they are non-overlapping.

To improve the plan:
- Instead of considering all substrings ending at index i in str1 and j in str2, consider all possible non-overlapping substrings.
- Use a more accurate state expression that takes into account whether the substrings are non-overlapping.
- Update rule should ensure that the common substrings found so far do not overlap.

To handle edge cases:
- The problem statement does not specify what to do if there are no common substrings. You need to consider this case in your plan.

Overall, your plan is a good start but needs more refinement to correctly solve the problem.
