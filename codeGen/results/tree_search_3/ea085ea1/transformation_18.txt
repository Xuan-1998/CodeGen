===BEGIN PLAN===

Dynamic Programming: The problem can be solved by considering all possible substrings of str1 and checking if they are present in str2, then use a 2D array to keep track of the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far when considering all substrings ending at index i in str1 and j in str2.
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(min(i, j))) + (str1[i] == str2[j])

DP solution can be implemented using a 2D array with dimensions N x N where each cell dp[i][j] stores the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far when considering all substrings ending at index i in str1 and j in str2.

The state expression is correct, but it seems that you're missing some details. For instance, how do you handle the case where a substring from str1 is not present in str2? You should add this detail to your plan.

Also, you didn't mention anything about initializing the dp array or base cases. You should think about how to initialize dp[0][j] and dp[i][0], as well as any edge cases that might exist.

Overall, I would say that your plan is a good start, but it's missing some important details. With these additions, your plan will be more comprehensive and easier to implement.
