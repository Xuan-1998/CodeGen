===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming and sliding window approach: Create two 2D arrays, dp1[i][j] and dp2[i][j], where i is the length of the current substring in str1 and j is the length of the current substring in str2. The arrays represent whether the substrings are common.
The state could be the set of all common substrings found so far, with the base case being an empty set.

State: two 2D arrays dp1[i][j] and dp2[i][j], where i is the length of the current substring in str1 and j is the length of the current substring in str2.
dp1[i][j] = 1 if the substrings of length i from str1 and j from str2 are common, and 0 otherwise.
dp2[i][j] = 1 if the substrings of length i+1 from str1 and j+1 from str2 are common, and 0 otherwise.

Initialization: dp1[0][0] = 1 (the empty string is always a common substring).

Transition function:
- If the current characters in both strings match, then we can extend the common substrings of length i and j to i+1 and j+1.
dp1[i][j] = dp2[i-1][j-1]

Base case: if the end of one string is reached (i.e., i or j equals N), then no more extensions are possible.

Main loop:
- Slide a window of length i and j over str1 and str2, respectively.
- Check for each substring within the window whether it is common between the two strings using dp1[i][j] and dp2[i][j].
- Keep track of the maximum number of such substrings found so far.

Output: The output is the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1 and str2.
