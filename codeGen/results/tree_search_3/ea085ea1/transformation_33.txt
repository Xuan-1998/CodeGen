Your initial plan seems to be correct, but let me analyze each step:

1. Memoization: This is a good approach for this problem as it involves computing the same subproblems multiple times, which can be optimized using memoization.

2. Define the state expression: Your definition of the state expression looks correct, representing the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j].

3. Represent each cell in the memoization table: You correctly represent each cell with a tuple (i, j, k) where i is the index of str1, j is the index of str2, and k represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j].

4. Implement memoization using a dictionary: This step also seems correct, as you would use this dictionary to store the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for previously computed subproblems.

As for improvements:

* Consider implementing a base case where i == j = 0, then the answer is 0, not an empty set.
* You might want to consider adding edge cases such as when str1 and str2 are identical or when they have no common characters. 

Potential issues with your plan:

* One issue could be that your plan doesn't handle overlapping substrings correctly, since you only check for non-overlapping substrings.

Edge cases:

* When str1 and str2 are identical: In this case, the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings would be N.
* When str1 and str2 have no common characters: The answer should be 0 in this case.

In summary, your plan seems correct but may need some tweaking to handle edge cases correctly. Keep going! You're on the right track!
