===BEGIN PLAN===

Memoization: Create a memoization table where each cell represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for two given strings. Fill this table by iterating over all possible substrings and checking if they are present in both input strings, then use this table to find the solution at the end.

Define the state expression as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. The base case is when i == j = 0, then the answer is 0.

Define a 2D array memo[N+1][N+1] where memo[i][j] stores the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j].

Correctness: The plan seems correct in terms of defining the state expression and the base case. However, there's a potential issue with the dynamic programming step.

Improvement: To improve the plan, consider using a more efficient algorithm instead of brute-force checking all possible substrings. For example, you can use suffix trees or suffix arrays to find common substrings in O(N) time complexity.

Edge Cases: The plan doesn't explicitly handle edge cases such as when str1 and str2 are identical or when they contain only unique characters (in which case the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings is 0). These edge cases should be handled separately to ensure correctness.

Potential Issues: One potential issue with the plan is that it may not be efficient enough for large inputs. As mentioned earlier, using more efficient algorithms can help improve performance.
