===BEGIN PLAN ANALYSIS AND IMPROVEMENTS===
Your initial plan is a good start, but let's break it down step by step to analyze its correctness, potential improvements, and edge cases:

1. **Sliding Window Approach**: Your intuition about using a sliding window approach is correct. This will allow you to efficiently check for common substrings between str1 and str2.

2. **State and Base Case**: The state could indeed be the current position in both strings. The base case would be when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string, which means no more new substrings can be found.

3. **Hash Map for Common Substrings**: Storing common substrings seen so far in a hash map is a good idea to keep track of unique substrings and avoid duplicates.

However, there are some potential issues and areas for improvement:

- **Handling Edge Cases**: What if one string is longer than the other? How would you handle this case?

- **Efficiency**: The plan could be improved by reducing unnecessary computations. For example, when moving the window, you can stop as soon as a mismatch is found, rather than checking the entire substring.

- **Optimizations**: You could also consider optimizing your hash map lookups by using a more efficient data structure or a better hashing function.

To address these issues and edge cases, here's an updated plan:
