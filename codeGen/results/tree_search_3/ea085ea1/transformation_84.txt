===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming: Create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[0..i-1] and str2[0..j-1]. 

Initially, set dp[0][0] = 1 (since there is always one common substring for two empty strings).

The state transition could be: 
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 if str1[i-1] == str2[j-1]) else dp[i-1][j] or dp[i][j-1]

This is because we can either consider the current characters as part of a common substring (if they match), or not consider them and move forward in one of the strings.

The base case could be when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string, i.e., i == N or j == N. In this case, dp[i][j] = 0 since we can't find any more common substrings after reaching the end of either string.

You can implement memoization by precomputing all possible substrings for each string and then using these precomputed values to find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings.

To prevent unnecessary computations, you could use a set data structure to store unique substrings found so far and check whether a substring is already present in this set before computing it. 

This approach should work fine as long as the strings are not too large to fit into memory.
