===BEGIN PLAN REVISION===
The initial plan looks promising, but let's break it down step by step to identify potential issues and areas for improvement.

1. Sliding window approach:
	* Correct: Using a sliding window can help us efficiently explore the substrings of both strings.
	* Improvement suggestion: Consider using a suffix tree or suffix array data structure to further optimize the search process.

2. State definition:
	* Correct: The state could indeed be represented by the current position in both strings, with the base case being when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string.
	* Improvement suggestion: To avoid redundant computations, consider using memoization to store and update the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far for each substring length.

3. Memoization:
	* Correct: Memoization can help reduce the computational complexity by avoiding repeated calculations.
	* Improvement suggestion: Make sure to properly initialize the memoization table and handle edge cases where the window reaches the end of either string.

4. Edge cases:
	* Correct: The plan does not explicitly mention edge cases, but it's crucial to consider them when implementing the solution.
	* Improvement suggestion: Identify edge cases such as when one or both strings are empty, and ensure the solution handles these cases correctly.

5. Potential issues:
	* None immediately apparent, but careful consideration of the plan's implementation details can help mitigate potential issues.

The revised plan incorporates these suggestions and emphasizes the importance of memoization, edge case handling, and optimizing the search process using a suffix tree or suffix array data structure.
