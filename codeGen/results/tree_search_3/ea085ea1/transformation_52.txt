===BEGIN PLAN ANALYSIS===
Code correctness:
Your plan seems to be on the right track. The idea of using a sliding window approach is correct, as it allows you to efficiently check for common substrings between str1 and str2. Additionally, storing the substrings as nodes in a tree can help keep track of non-overlapping common substrings.

However, there are a few potential issues with your plan:

* How do you plan to handle edge cases? For example, what if one or both strings contain only one unique character?
* Are you sure that the state (set of substrings) is sufficient for tracking the maximum number of non-overlapping common substrings?

Improvements:
To improve your plan, consider the following:

* Start by initializing a set to store the common substrings. Then, use two pointers (one for each string) to slide along both strings and check for matching characters.
* When a match is found, add the corresponding substring to the set of common substrings.
* To keep track of non-overlapping substrings, you can use a tree data structure with nodes representing substrings. Each node should have two child nodes: one for the left child (previous substring) and one for the right child (next substring).

Edge cases:
Don't forget to consider edge cases! For example:

* If str1 or str2 contains only one unique character, there can be at most one common non-overlapping substring.
* If both strings are empty, return 0.

Tree construction:
To construct the tree, follow these steps:

* Start by adding the shortest common substring (i.e., a length-1 substring) to the tree as the root node.
* For each subsequent common substring, find its left and right child nodes in the tree. If no such nodes exist, add them.
* The maximum number of non-overlapping common substrings can be calculated by traversing the tree from the root node down.

Your plan is a good starting point, but consider these suggestions to improve it! ===END PLAN ANALYSIS===
