===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming: The problem can be solved by considering all possible substrings of str1 and checking if they are present in str2, then use a 2D array to keep track of the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at index i in str1 and j in str2.
dp[i][j] = 1 if s1[i-k:i+1] == s2[j-l:j+m] for some k, l, m

Use a 2D array to implement tabulation with nested loops, where the outer loop iterates over str1 and the inner loop iterates over str2.
