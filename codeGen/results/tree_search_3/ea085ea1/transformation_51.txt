===BEGIN PLAN REVISION===
The initial plan seems to be on the right track, but let's break down each step and identify potential issues and improvements:

1. Sliding window approach: This is a good start. However, we need to consider how to efficiently check for common substrings within the window.

2. Dynamic Programming state: The state could be a 2D array or list of lists where the outer dimensions represent the length of the current common substring and the inner dimension represents the substrings found so far. This would allow us to keep track of the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1 and str2.

3. Binary search approach: Using a Trie data structure might not be necessary for this problem, as we're looking for all possible substrings, not just prefixes or suffixes. A more straightforward approach could be to use a set or map to store the unique substrings found so far and then iterate through the strings to find common substrings.

4. Potential issues with the plan: 
   - The plan doesn't consider edge cases such as what happens when N is very large, str1 and str2 are very long, or there are many repeated characters.
   - It also doesn't handle cases where two identical characters in a row might be treated differently.

5. Edge case consideration:
   - We should ensure that the plan handles cases where N is close to 100, which could result in large substrings and potentially slow down the algorithm.
   - The algorithm should also handle cases where there are many repeated characters in str1 and str2, as this would affect the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings.

6. Improved plan:
    - Create a sliding window that moves along the strings str1 and str2
    - For each substring within the window, check if it is common between str1 and str2 by comparing characters at corresponding positions
    - Use a set or map to store unique substrings found so far and keep track of the maximum number of such substrings
    - Iterate through the strings to find common substrings and update the maximum count
