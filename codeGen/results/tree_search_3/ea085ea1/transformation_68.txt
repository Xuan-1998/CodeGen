Your plan shows a good understanding of the problem and a willingness to apply dynamic programming. The sliding window approach is a great way to find all possible substrings within a certain range, which can be useful here.

One thing that's not entirely clear from your plan is what you mean by "check for each substring within the window whether it is common between the two strings." It seems like you're assuming that once you've identified a substring that is common to both strings, you'll just add 1 to some running total of maximum number of common substrings found so far. But how will you actually check if a given substring is common? Will you be using a hash set or something similar?

Another thing to consider is what happens when the window straddles the end of one of the strings. Do you have a plan for handling this case, or do you think it's not possible for the window to ever reach the end of either string?

Finally, have you thought about how to efficiently keep track of the maximum number of common substrings found so far? Will you be using a variable that gets updated at each step, or will you be calculating the maximum from scratch every time?

Overall, your plan is on the right track, but there are some details that need to be ironed out before it can be considered complete.
