===BEGIN PLAN REVISION AND ANALYSIS===
Dynamic Programming: The problem can be solved by considering all possible substrings of str1 and checking if they are present in str2, then use a 2D array to keep track of the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far when considering all substrings ending at index i in str1 and j in str2.
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(j)) if str1[i] == str2[j] else 0

The plan is correct, but there's a potential issue with the edge case where str1[i] != str2[j]. In this case, dp[i][j] should be set to the maximum of all previous values (i.e., max(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(j)) instead of 0. This is because even if str1[i] and str2[j] don't match, we can still consider substrings that end at index i-1 in str1.

Another potential issue is when there's a mismatch between str1[i] and str2[j], but they're part of the same common substring. In this case, we should keep track of the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending before i in str1 and j in str2, and then increment it accordingly.

To improve the plan, we can consider using a sliding window approach to reduce the time complexity. We can maintain two pointers, one for each string, starting from the beginning of both strings. Then, slide these pointers forward if the characters at the current positions match. This way, we can avoid considering all possible substrings.

The revised plan includes edge cases by handling mismatched characters correctly and keeps track of the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings.
