Memoization: This is a good idea, but I think there might be a more efficient way to solve this problem. Instead of filling up a huge memoization table, we can use a combination of string matching and dynamic programming.

Define the state expression as a set of tuples (i, j) representing the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. The base case is when i == j = 0, then the answer is an empty set.

This definition seems correct. We can use this to keep track of the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings we've seen so far.

Define the state expression as a set of tuples (i, j) representing the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. Then define the transition relationships based on whether the current character in str1 is the same as the current character in str2 or not.

This is where things get interesting. We can use dynamic programming to build up our solution incrementally. Here's one way we could do it:

* Initialize a 2D table dp of size (N+1) x (M+1), where N and M are the lengths of str1 and str2, respectively.
* For each character in str1, iterate over all possible substrings ending at that position. For each substring, check if it's present in str2. If it is, update our dp table accordingly.
* Use this dp table to find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings.

Determine the base case by initializing the dynamic programming table with an empty set when the current character in str1 matches the current character in str2.

This seems correct as well. We can start building up our solution from the beginning of both strings, and see how many common substrings we can find.

===END PLAN===

Overall, your plan is good, but I think there are a few ways to improve it. For example, instead of filling up a huge memoization table, we can use dynamic programming to build up our solution incrementally. This could make the code more efficient and easier to understand. Additionally, we should definitely include edge cases in our problem-solving approach, such as what happens when str1 or str2 is empty, or when they're not of equal length.
