===BEGIN PLAN ANALYSIS===
Your initial plan is a good starting point, but let's break it down step by step to identify potential issues and areas for improvement:

1. Sliding window approach: This idea is solid, as you can indeed use a sliding window to check for common substrings within the two input strings.

2. Dynamic programming state: You've correctly identified the need for a dynamic programming state, which in this case could be the length of the current common substring. However, it might be more accurate to store the set of all common substrings found so far, rather than just their lengths.

3. State transitions: The idea of adding or removing substrings from the set is correct. You'll need to determine the conditions under which a new substring is added and when an existing one is removed.

4. Dictionary for storing substrings: Storing the substrings seen so far in a dictionary with their frequencies can be useful for tracking commonality, but it's not necessary at this point. This could be added later as an optimization step.

5. Edge cases: The plan doesn't explicitly address edge cases such as empty strings or lengths less than 1. You should consider handling these scenarios before moving forward.

Here's a revised version of your plan that addresses some of the concerns above:
