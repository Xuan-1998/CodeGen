===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization: Create a memoization table where each cell represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for two given strings. Fill this table by iterating over all possible substrings and checking if they are present in both input strings, then use this table to find the solution at the end.

Define the state expression as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. The base case is when i == j = 0, then the answer is 0. This approach seems correct so far.

However, I think there's room for improvement in terms of efficiency. Instead of using a memoization table with three dimensions (i, j, k), we can simplify it to a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j], considering only substrings up to length i. This way, we avoid unnecessary computation.

Here's an updated plan:

1. Initialize a 2D array dp[N+1][N+1] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j], considering only substrings up to length i.
2. Fill the dp table by iterating over all possible substrings and checking if they are present in both input strings.
3. The base case is when i == j = 0, then the answer is 0.
