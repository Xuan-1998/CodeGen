Your plan is correct, but there are some minor suggestions for improvement.

The main idea of using a sliding window approach to find common non-overlapping substrings between str1 and str2 is sound. 

Using dynamic programming with memoization can definitely help in avoiding repeated computations and improve the efficiency of your solution.

One possible issue with this plan could be that it might not correctly handle edge cases, such as when there are multiple occurrences of a substring in either string. You would need to consider these scenarios carefully when implementing your plan.

However, overall, I think your plan is a good starting point for solving the problem.
