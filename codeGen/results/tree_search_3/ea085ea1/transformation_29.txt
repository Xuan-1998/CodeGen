===BEGIN ANALYSIS OF PLAN===
Your intuition about this being a Dynamic Programming problem is correct! The problem involves finding the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between two given strings.

The memoization approach you proposed is a good starting point. By creating a table to store the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for each pair of substrings from str1 and str2, you can avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.

Your definition of the state expression as a set of tuples (i, j) representing the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j] is also correct. The base case where i == j = 0 makes sense, since there are no common non-overlapping substrings when both strings are empty.

However, I would suggest refining your transition relationships to better capture the dynamics of the problem. Specifically, you should consider whether the current characters in both strings are the same or not, as this will affect the number of common non-overlapping substrings found.

One potential issue with your plan is that it may not handle edge cases properly. For example, what if one string is a prefix of the other? Or what if there are no common non-overlapping substrings at all?

To address these concerns, I would recommend adding more edge cases to your transition relationships and memoization table. This could include handling cases where i == j != 0, or where one string is a prefix of the other.

Overall, your plan has potential and can be improved with some refinements. Keep going!
