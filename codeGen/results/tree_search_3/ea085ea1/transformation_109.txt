===BEGIN ANALYSIS===
Your plan is mostly correct, but there are a few areas that can be improved upon.

The sliding window approach you mentioned will indeed help us find common non-overlapping substrings between str1 and str2. However, the state transition logic could be improved to correctly calculate dp[i][j].

Here's an updated version of your plan with some suggestions:

State: Instead of using a dictionary prev[substr] where substr is the last common substring found, consider storing the maximum number of non-overlapping common substrings ending at i and j. This can be represented as a 2D array dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of non-overlapping common substrings between str1[0:i] and str2[0:j].

State Transition: To correctly calculate dp[i][j], you'll need to iterate through all possible substrings within the sliding window [i-j]. For each substring, check if it is common in both str1 and str2. If it is, update dp[i][j] by adding 1 (since we found a new non-overlapping common substring) and also update dp[i-1][j-1] by subtracting 1 (since we removed one non-overlapping common substring ending at i-1 and j-1).

Base Case: The base case would still be an empty set, but in terms of the dynamic programming table, it's the top-left corner where both i and j are 0. Initialize dp[0][0] to 0.

Edge Cases: You'll need to consider edge cases such as when one or both strings are empty. In that case, you can return 0 since there are no non-overlapping common substrings.

Overall, your plan is a good start, but with some adjustments and refinements, it can be even more effective.
