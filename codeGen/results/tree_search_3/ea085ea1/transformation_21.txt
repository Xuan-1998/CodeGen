===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization: Create a memoization table where each cell represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for two given strings. Fill this table by iterating over all possible substrings and checking if they are present in both input strings, then use this table to find the solution at the end.

Define the state expression as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. The base case is when i == j = 0, then the answer is 0.

Create a DP table dp[i][j] to store the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. The state expression is dp[i][j], which represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between two given strings. Fill this table by iterating over all possible substrings and checking if they are present in both input strings, then use this table to find the solution at the end.

Use two nested loops i from 1 to N and j from 1 to N to fill the table. In each iteration, check if str1[i-1] is equal to str2[j-1]. If they are equal, update dp[i][j] as dp[i-1][j-1] + 1.

However, this plan has a potential issue: it only considers matching characters at the current position, but does not take into account common substrings that may be present elsewhere in the strings. To address this, we need to consider all possible substrings and check if they are present in both input strings.

To improve this plan, we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem more efficiently. Create a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. Fill this table by iterating over all possible substrings and checking if they are present in both input strings, then use this table to find the solution at the end.

Additionally, we can also consider edge cases such as when one or both of the strings is empty. In these cases, the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings would be 0.
