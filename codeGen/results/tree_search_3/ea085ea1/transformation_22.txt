===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization: Create a memoization table where each cell represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for two given strings. However, this approach might be inefficient as it involves checking all possible substrings which can lead to high time complexity.

Define the state expression as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. The base case is when i == j = 0, then the answer is 0. This approach is correct.

Create a DP table dp[i][j] to store the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. However, this approach might not be efficient as it involves iterating over all possible substrings which can lead to high time complexity.

Instead, we can preprocess the strings by creating a suffix tree for each string. Then, we can find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between the two strings by traversing the shared nodes in the suffix trees.

Implement memoization by creating a dictionary memo and storing the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for each substring in the memo dictionary. This approach is correct.

However, this plan does not handle edge cases such as when str1 and str2 are empty or have different lengths. We need to add checks for these edge cases at the beginning of our code.
