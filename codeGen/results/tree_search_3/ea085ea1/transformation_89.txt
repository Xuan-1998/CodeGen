Your plan to solve this problem using a sliding window approach with dynamic programming (DP) is correct! It's a great way to think about the problem.

Here are some details and improvements you could consider:

* The state you described, which keeps track of the current position in both strings, is a good start. You could also keep track of the length of the common substring found so far.
* Memoization is a key aspect of DP, and your plan to store the maximum number of common substrings seen so far is a great idea. This will allow you to avoid redundant calculations and make the solution more efficient.
* When one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string, it's clear that the sliding window has reached the end of the strings. You could add a base case for this situation to handle it correctly.
* Another thing to consider is how you will determine whether two substrings are common or not. You might need to compare characters in the substrings and check if they match.

Some potential issues with your plan that you should be aware of:

* What happens when the strings don't share any common substrings? Your plan seems to assume that there will always be some common substrings, but it's possible that this isn't the case.
* How will you handle edge cases like strings of length 1 or empty strings?

Overall, your plan is a good starting point for solving this problem. With a few tweaks and considerations, you should be able to come up with an efficient solution.
