===BEGIN ANALYSIS===
The plan you proposed seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed.

Firstly, using a sliding window approach can indeed work well for this problem. The idea of creating a sliding window and checking for each substring within it whether it is common between the two strings is a good one.

The state you proposed, which is the current position in both strings, with the base case being when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string, also seems correct.

However, using a 2D table to store the maximum number of common substrings ending at each position in both strings might not be the most efficient approach. This is because it would require O(N^2) space complexity, where N is the length of the input strings.

A better approach could be to use dynamic programming with a 1D array instead of a 2D table. The idea would be to keep track of the maximum number of common substrings ending at each position in one string, and then update this value based on the maximum number of common substrings found so far in the other string.

Another issue that needs to be addressed is edge cases. For example, what if one of the strings is a substring of the other? In this case, we would need to adjust our plan accordingly.

Overall, your plan has some good ideas, but it could be improved by using a more efficient approach and addressing potential edge cases.
