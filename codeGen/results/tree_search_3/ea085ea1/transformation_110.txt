The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach, as you correctly identified.

The sliding window approach is a good idea, but I think it might not be the most efficient way to solve this problem. Instead, we could use a two-pointer approach to find common substrings between str1 and str2. This would involve iterating through both strings simultaneously, checking for matches at each step, and keeping track of the maximum number of non-overlapping common substrings.

The state you proposed, prev[substr], is a good idea. However, I think it's more straightforward to represent the state as (i, j) pairs, where i and j are indices into str1 and str2, respectively. This would allow us to easily look up the maximum number of non-overlapping common substrings ending at each position.

Implementing memoization with a dictionary is also a good idea. By storing previously computed values in memo, we can avoid recomputing the same values multiple times, which would greatly improve performance for larger inputs.

One potential issue I see with your plan is that it doesn't explicitly handle edge cases, such as strings of length 0 or strings that contain only unique characters (in which case there would be no common substrings). We should make sure to include checks for these cases at the beginning of our algorithm.

Overall, your plan has some good ideas, but could benefit from a bit more refinement and attention to edge cases. With some adjustments, I think it could be a solid foundation for a working solution.
