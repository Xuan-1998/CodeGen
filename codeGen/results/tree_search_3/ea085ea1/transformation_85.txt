===BEGIN FEEDBACK===
Your plan to use a sliding window approach is a good starting point, but it might be improved upon. The main idea of using a state that tracks the current position in both strings and transitioning to new states based on whether substrings are common or not is correct.

However, there's an issue with the "transition" part - you don't specify what kind of table you would store the common substrings in, or how you would update it. This could be clarified by defining a 2D array dp[][] where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring from index i to j is common between str1 and str2.

The plan also doesn't explicitly mention handling edge cases, such as when one of the strings ends before the other does. These edge cases should be considered and accounted for in your dynamic programming approach.

Additionally, the plan could benefit from a clear specification of what constitutes a "common substring". Is it a contiguous sequence of characters that appears in both str1 and str2? Or is there some additional criteria (e.g., minimum length) that must also be met?

Overall, your plan has potential but needs further refinement.
