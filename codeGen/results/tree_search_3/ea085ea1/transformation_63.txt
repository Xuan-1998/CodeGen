===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming: Create a 2D array dp[][] where dp[i][j] will store the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far for positions i in str1 and j in str2. The state could be the current position in both strings, with the base case being when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string.

We can initialize the dp[][] array such that dp[i][0] = 0 for all i, because we haven't considered any characters from str2 yet. Similarly, dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, because we haven't considered any characters from str1 yet.

Then, we move the sliding window along both strings. For each position (i, j), if the current character in str1 and str2 are the same, it means we have found a common substring ending at this position. In this case, dp[i][j] will be equal to dp[i-1][j-1] + 1, because we add one more common non-overlapping substring to the previous maximum number of substrings.

We also need to consider edge cases: when i or j reaches N, it means we have reached the end of one of the strings. In this case, we set dp[i][j] = 0, because there are no more characters left in that string to be considered as part of a common substring.

The maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings is stored in dp[N-1][N-1].
