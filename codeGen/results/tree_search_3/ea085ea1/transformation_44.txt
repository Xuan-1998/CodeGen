===BEGIN PLAN===

Memoization: Create a memoization table where each cell represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for two given strings. Fill this table by iterating over all possible substrings and checking if they are present in both input strings, then use this table to find the solution at the end.

Define the state expression as a dictionary dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. The base case is when i == j = 0, then the answer is 0 because we haven't processed any characters from both strings yet.

for i in range(N+1):
    for j in range(N+1):
        if i == 0 or j == 0:
            dp[i][j] = 0
        else:
            dp[i][j] = max((str1[:i] == str2[:j]) and (dp[i-1][j-1] + 1) or dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

The plan is now more complete and clear.

Potential issues with the plan:

* The plan assumes that the input strings are non-empty. We should add a check to handle this case.
* The plan does not consider edge cases where some characters in both strings are the same but they do not form a common substring. We should add a check to handle this case.

Overall, the plan is correct and can be improved by adding more clarity and handling edge cases.
