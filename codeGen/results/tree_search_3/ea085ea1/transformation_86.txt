The overall idea of using a sliding window approach is correct, but let's break it down step by step to identify potential issues and areas for improvement.

1. The state could be the current position in both strings, with the base case being when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string.
	* This seems like a good starting point. However, we need to make sure that our dynamic programming approach is taking into account all possible substrings within the window.

2. Use a dictionary to store the common substrings found so far, with the key being the substring and the value being 1 for each occurrence.
	* This could work if we're only interested in finding unique substrings. However, since we want to find the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings, we might need to consider overlapping substrings as well.

3. Then update this dictionary as you slide the window.
	* This step needs further clarification. How do we decide whether a substring is common between the two strings? What if a substring appears multiple times within the window?

4. To improve the plan, let's try to consider all possible substrings within the window and see how they relate to each other.

5. Another potential issue with this plan is that it might not account for edge cases. For example, what if one of the strings is shorter than the other? Or what if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring?

6. To address these concerns, we could try using a more sophisticated data structure like a trie to keep track of common substrings and their frequencies.

7. Another approach would be to use a two-pointer technique to slide along both strings simultaneously and find all possible non-overlapping substrings that appear in both strings.

8. Finally, let's make sure our plan includes edge cases. For example, what if one or both strings are empty? How do we handle this situation?
