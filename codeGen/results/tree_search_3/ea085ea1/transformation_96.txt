===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with a 2D table to store the maximum number of common substrings found so far for each position in both strings.

1. Initialize two arrays dp1 and dp2 of size N+1, where N is the length of the input strings.
   dp1[i] will store the maximum number of common substrings ending at position i in str1.
   dp2[i] will store the maximum number of common substrings ending at position i in str2.

2. Iterate over the positions in both strings using a sliding window approach, considering all possible substrings within each window.

3. For each substring, check if it is present in the other string. If yes, update dp1[i] or dp2[i] accordingly based on whether the current position is at the end of its respective string.

4. The state transition can be as follows: dp1[i+1] = max(dp1[i], dp1[i-1]) + 1 (if the current substring is common) and similarly for str2.

5. Update the maximum number of common substrings found so far using memoization and update it accordingly as you slide along the strings. This will give us the final answer.

6. The base case would be when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string, at which point we can stop updating dp1[i] or dp2[i].
