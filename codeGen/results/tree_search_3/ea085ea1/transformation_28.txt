===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization: Create a memoization table where each cell represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for two given strings. Fill this table by iterating over all possible substrings and checking if they are present in both input strings, then use this table to find the solution at the end.
Define the state expression as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. The base case is when i == j = 0, then the answer is 0.

**ISSUE**: This approach seems to be focusing on a single cell at a time, which might not be efficient. We can do better than that!

Use a 3D array dp[N+1][N+1][N+1] where dp[i][j][k] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j] considering only substrings up to length k. Fill this table by iterating over all possible substrings and checking if they are present in both input strings, then use this table to find the solution at the end.

**ISSUE**: This approach is still quite inefficient. We can do better than that!

Use a prefix and suffix tree data structure to efficiently find the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1 and str2.

**ISSUE**: While using a prefix and suffix tree can help with substring matching, it might not be necessary for this problem. Let's focus on finding a more efficient approach first!

Overall, your plan is a good start! You're thinking in the right direction. However, we need to refine our approach to make it more efficient.

Here are some suggestions:

* Instead of iterating over all possible substrings, can we find a way to iterate over the substrings in a more controlled manner? For example, by considering only suffixes or prefixes?
* Can we use dynamic programming to solve this problem? Yes! Let's do that!
* What about using a hash table to store the substrings and their indices?

Let me know what you think, and I can help you refine your plan further!
