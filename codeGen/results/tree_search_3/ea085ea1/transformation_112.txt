===BEGIN ANALYSIS===
Your initial plan is mostly correct, but there are a few potential issues that need to be addressed.

The sliding window approach is a good starting point. However, you may want to consider using a more efficient data structure than a dictionary to store the count of previously found common substrings. A simple array or list could suffice, where each index represents the length of the substring and the value at that index is the count of such substrings.

You're right about the state being the set of all common substrings found so far. However, you may want to consider using a more efficient data structure than a set for this as well. A list or array could be used instead, where each element represents a common substring and its index in the list corresponds to the length of the substring.

The transition relationship is also mostly correct. You're right that when a new common substring is found, its length should be added to the count stored in prev dictionary. However, you may want to consider handling edge cases more explicitly in your plan. For example, what if no common substrings are found? How will you handle this case?

One potential issue with your plan is that it doesn't explicitly account for edge cases, such as what happens when there are no common substrings or when the maximum length of a common substring exceeds 100.

Another potential issue is that your plan may not be optimized for performance. You may want to consider using more efficient data structures and algorithms to improve the efficiency of your solution.

Overall, your initial plan is a good starting point, but there are some areas where you could improve it further.
