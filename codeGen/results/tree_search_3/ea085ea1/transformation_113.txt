===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using sliding window approach: Create a sliding window that moves along the strings str1 and str2, and check for each substring within the window whether it is common between the two strings. Then keep track of the maximum number of such substrings found so far.

The state could be the set of all common substrings found so far, with the base case being an empty set.

The transition relationship can be formulated as follows: if a new common substring is found, then its length is added to the count stored in prev dictionary; otherwise, there is no transition.

Store the count of previously found common substrings in an array prev, where prev[i] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2.
