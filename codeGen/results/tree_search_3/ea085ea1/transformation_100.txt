===BEGIN ANALYSIS===
The plan you proposed, using a sliding window approach with dynamic programming, has a good foundation.

However, there are a few potential issues to consider:
- When checking for common substrings within the window, how do we ensure that we don't count overlapping substrings? To avoid this, we can keep track of the end position of the last common substring found.
- How will we handle edge cases where the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings is not at the beginning or the end of the strings?
To improve the plan, consider using a 2D table to store the maximum number of common substrings found at each position in both strings. This would allow us to keep track of the state as we move along the strings.
The base case could be when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string.
