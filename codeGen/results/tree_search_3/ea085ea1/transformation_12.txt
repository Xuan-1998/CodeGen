===BEGIN PLAN===

Dynamic Programming: The problem can be solved by considering all possible substrings of str1 and checking if they are present in str2, then use a 2D array to keep track of the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far when considering all substrings ending at index i in str1 and j in str2.
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(j)) if str1[i] == str2[j] else 0

This plan seems to be correct. It uses dynamic programming to solve the problem, which is a good approach since it involves finding maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings.

However, there are some potential issues that need to be considered:

- Edge cases: The plan does not seem to consider edge cases where one or both strings are empty. In such cases, the function should return 0.

- Correctness: It's important to ensure that the dynamic programming algorithm is correct and gives the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings.

- Efficiency: The current plan has a time complexity of O(N^3) due to nested loops in the dp[i][j] calculation. This might not be efficient enough for large inputs.

Overall, the plan seems to be on the right track, but needs to be refined and tested to ensure correctness, handle edge cases, and improve efficiency.
