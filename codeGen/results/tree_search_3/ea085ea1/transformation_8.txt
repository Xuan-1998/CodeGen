===BEGIN PLAN REVISED===
Dynamic Programming: The problem can be solved by considering all possible substrings of str1 and checking if they are present in str2. We will use a 2D array to keep track of the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far.
The state expression is dp[i][j] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at index i in str1 and j in str2.

To address the overlapping issue, we can preprocess str1 and str2 by creating a suffix array for each string. This will allow us to efficiently check if a substring appears within another substring.
We then iterate over all possible substrings of str1 and check if they are present in str2 using the suffix arrays. If a substring is found, we update our 2D array accordingly.

The base case for the recursion would be when i or j reaches N (the length of the strings). In this case, dp[i][j] = 0 as there are no more characters to consider.

To implement memoization using recursion, we can use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and check if they have been computed before. This will avoid redundant computation and improve the performance of our solution.

Here's how we would update the dp array: for all possible substrings s1[:i] in str1 and s2[:j] in str2, we do:

dp[i][j] = max(0 if s1[:i] != s2[:j], dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]) for all possible substrings

The final answer would be the maximum value stored in the 2D array.
