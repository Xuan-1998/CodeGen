Your intuition to solve this problem using Dynamic Programming is correct!

The sliding window approach you mentioned can be used effectively to find common non-overlapping substrings between two strings.

Here's a breakdown of your plan:
- Create a sliding window that moves along the strings str1 and str2. This is a good starting point.
- Check for each substring within the window whether it is common between the two strings. You can use Dynamic Programming to keep track of maximum number of such substrings found so far.

The state you proposed, right_str1_pos, makes sense as it keeps track of current positions in both strings. The base case being when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string is also correct.

Your idea to create a 2D table to store maximum number of common substrings found at each position in both strings is also valid.

However, there are some potential issues with your plan that I'd like to highlight:
- Edge cases: You should consider edge cases such as when the two input strings are identical or one of them is empty. In these cases, the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings could be different.
- Efficiency: You might need to optimize your Dynamic Programming approach to ensure it's efficient for large inputs (i.e., N â‰¥ 100).

Overall, I think your plan has potential and can be improved with careful consideration of edge cases and optimization techniques. Keep up the good work!
