===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with a sliding window approach: Create a 2D table where each cell (i, j) represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[0..i] and str2[0..j]. The state could be the current position in both strings.

The base case is when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string: If i or j equals N-1, then it means we have reached the end of a string. In this case, the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at that position in both strings would be 0 (as there are no more characters to compare).

The recurrence relation is as follows:
* If str1[i] == str2[j], then the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at that position is equal to the value stored in the cell above it (i-1, j-1), plus 1. This is because we found a new common substring.
* If str1[i] != str2[j], then the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at that position is the same as the value stored in the cell to the left of it (i-1, j) or above it (i, j-1), whichever is larger. This is because we cannot include this character in any common substring.

The plan can be improved by using a prefix sum approach: Instead of recalculating the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for each cell, we can calculate the total number of common substrings ending at each position and subtract the number of common substrings ending at previous positions. This reduces the time complexity from O(N^2) to O(N).

One potential issue with this plan is that it assumes that the strings only contain characters represented by * or # or @, which is a constraint given in the problem statement.

The plan includes edge cases: The base case handles the situation when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string. However, it's worth noting that this plan does not handle the case where str1 and str2 are identical strings (i.e., they have no common substrings). This would need to be handled separately.
