===BEGIN PLAN REVISION===
The original plan shows promise, but there are some areas that can be improved upon.

===ISSUES WITH THE ORIGINAL PLAN===
1. The state variable dp[i][j] is not well-defined. What does it represent exactly? Is it the set of all common substrings found so far? If so, how will you efficiently check whether a new substring is in this set?

2. Memoization using a dictionary to store subproblem results seems like a good idea, but what are the subproblems that need memoization? What are their inputs and outputs?

3. The plan does not explicitly mention handling edge cases, such as when str1 and str2 have different lengths.

===REVISED PLAN===
To fix these issues, let's start by defining the state variable dp[i][j] more clearly:

dp[i][j] = True if the substring of length i in str1 ending at index j is common with a substring of length j in str2, and False otherwise.

Now, let's identify the subproblems that need memoization. For each pair of substrings from str1 and str2, we want to check whether they are common or not. This can be broken down into smaller subproblems:

* Check if the current character in both strings is equal
* If yes, recursively check the substring without this character
* If no, move on to the next pair of substrings

Memoization will help us avoid recalculating these subproblems multiple times.

To handle edge cases, we should explicitly check for the following:
* When str1 and str2 have different lengths, return 0 as there are no common non-overlapping substrings.
* When one string is a prefix of the other, return 0 as there are no common non-overlapping substrings (except for the full strings themselves).

===FINAL PLAN===
Here's the revised plan:
