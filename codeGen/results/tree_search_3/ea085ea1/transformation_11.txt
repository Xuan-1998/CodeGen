===BEGIN PLAN REANALYSIS===
Your plan seems to be on the right track, but there are some potential issues that need to be addressed.

Firstly, the state expression you provided seems correct. dp[i][j] = 1 if the substring from i to i+1 in str1 matches a non-overlapping substring from j to j+1 in str2, otherwise it's 0. This can help keep track of the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far.

However, there are some edge cases that need to be considered:

* What if str1 and str2 are not of equal length? How would you handle this?
* What if a character in str1 matches multiple characters in str2? How would you handle this?
* What if two or more non-overlapping substrings match the same substring in str2? How would you handle this?

To improve your plan, I would suggest considering these edge cases and coming up with a clear strategy for handling them.

Additionally, you may want to consider using a hashmap to store the characters in str2 as you iterate through it. This could help speed up the matching process by allowing you to check if a character is present in O(1) time instead of O(n) time.

Here's an updated version of your plan that addresses these issues:
