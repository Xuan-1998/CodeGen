===BEGIN ANALYSIS===
Your plan is a good start, but there are some potential issues that need to be addressed.

1. The state expression dp[i][j] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at index i in str1 and j in str2 seems correct.
2. However, the transition function dp[i][j] = max(0 if s1[:i] != s2[:j], dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]) needs to be revised.

The issue is that you are trying to find all possible substrings of str1 and check if they are present in str2, which has a time complexity of O(N^3). This can be improved by using the concept of "suffix tree" or "longest common prefix" to reduce the search space.

One way to improve this is by creating two suffix trees (or arrays) for str1 and str2. Then, you can use these suffix trees to find all common substrings in O(N) time complexity. This approach is more efficient than the original plan.

3. Your plan does not consider edge cases such as when N = 0 or both strings are empty.
4. The plan does not specify how to initialize the dp table or handle the base case (i.e., what happens when i and j are 0).

Overall, your plan is a good start, but it needs some revisions to make it more efficient and robust.
