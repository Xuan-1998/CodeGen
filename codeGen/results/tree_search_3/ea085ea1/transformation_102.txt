===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming with a Sliding Window approach:
1. Initialize a 2D table dp[i][j] where i is the current position in str1 and j is the current position in str2.
2. For each position (i, j), check if the substring from index 0 to i in str1 is equal to the substring from index 0 to j in str2.
3. If it is, then update dp[i][j] with the length of this common prefix.
4. Else, set dp[i][j] to 0.
5. The state would be the current position in both strings, and the base case would be when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string.
6. Transition: Use the previously computed values in the table to update the current position.

Transition:
For each position (i, j), check for each possible substring within the window whether it is common between str1 and str2.
Then keep track of the maximum number of such substrings found so far.

State: The current position in both strings, with the base case being when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string.
