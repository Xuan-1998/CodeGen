===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using sliding window approach: Create a sliding window that moves along the strings str1 and str2, and check for each substring within the window whether it is common between the two strings. Then keep track of the maximum number of such substrings found so far.

The state could be the current position in both strings, with the base case being when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string.

max_common_substr_count

Use dynamic programming with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
