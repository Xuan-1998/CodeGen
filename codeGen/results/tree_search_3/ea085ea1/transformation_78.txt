===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming with a sliding window approach: Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] will store whether the substring from str1[0..i] to str1[0..j] is common with str2.
Create a sliding window that moves along the strings str1 and str2, and check for each substring within the window whether it is common between the two strings. Then keep track of the maximum number of such substrings found so far.
The state could be the current position in both strings, with the base case being when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string.
left_str1_pos: We need to consider this variable while updating dp[i][j] value.
Memoize the function to check whether two given substrings are equal using a dictionary. This will speed up the comparison process.

To improve the plan, we can use suffix trees or Z-function (Z-algorithm) to find all common substrings and then count the maximum number of non-overlapping ones.

There might be potential issues with edge cases like when one string is a substring of the other, or when there are repeated characters in both strings. We need to consider these edge cases while implementing the plan.
