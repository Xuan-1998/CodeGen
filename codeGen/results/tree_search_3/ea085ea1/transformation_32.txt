===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization: Create a memoization table where each cell represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for two given strings. Fill this table by iterating over all possible substrings and checking if they are present in both input strings, then use this table to find the solution at the end.

Define the state expression as a set of tuples (i, j) representing the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. The base case is when i == j = 0, then the answer is an empty set.

Represent each cell in the memoization table by a tuple (i, j, k) where i is the index of str1, j is the index of str2, and k represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. Define the transition relationships based on whether the current characters in both strings are the same or not.

Create a 3D table where each cell represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for two given strings and their indices, then fill this table by iterating over all possible substrings and checking if they are present in both input strings.
