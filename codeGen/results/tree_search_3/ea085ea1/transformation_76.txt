The problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming with memoization:

1. Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j].
2. Initialize dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] to 0 for all i, j.
3. For each substring str1[i:j] in str1 and str2[k:l], check if it is common:
   - If the substring is common, update dp[i][k] with the maximum of its current value and dp[i-1][k-1] + 1.
4. Use a dictionary memo to store the results of subproblems, mapping (i, j) tuples to the corresponding dp value.
5. The base case is when i or j reaches the end of its respective string.

The key insight here is that we can build upon previously computed values by considering substrings that share a common prefix.

Potential issues with the plan:
- Edge cases: Make sure to handle the cases where one of the strings is an empty string (i.e., i or j reaches 0).
- Overlapping substrings: To avoid double-counting, ensure that we only consider non-overlapping substrings.
- Memoization: Use a dictionary to store and retrieve previously computed values efficiently.
