Your plan looks solid, but let's break it down step by step to make sure we're on the right track.

1. The sliding window approach seems like a good idea. It allows us to check for substrings of varying lengths within str1 and str2.
2. Your state definition (i, j) makes sense, as it keeps track of the length of the current common substring in both strings. However, we should clarify that i and j represent the ending indices of the common substring in each string, not its length.
