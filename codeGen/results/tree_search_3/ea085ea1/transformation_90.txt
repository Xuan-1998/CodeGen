===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with a sliding window approach: 
Create a 2D array dp[][] where dp[i][j] will store the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings seen so far in the first i characters of str1 and the first j characters of str2.
The state could be the current position in both strings, with the base case being when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string.

state:
- Initialize dp[0][0] to 0
- For each i from 1 to N (length of str1) and j from 1 to M (length of str2)
    - If characters at positions i and j are same, then 
        dp[i][j] = max(1 + dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]) // recursive relation
    - else
        dp[i][j] = 0

Tabulate the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings seen so far using a dictionary.
