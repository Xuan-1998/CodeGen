The problem can be solved using dynamic programming.

The state could be the set of all common substrings found so far, with the base case being an empty set.

The transition relationship can be formulated as follows: if the current characters in both strings match, then the state transitions from dp[i-1][j-1] to dp[i][j], indicating that a common substring has been found; otherwise, there is no transition.

Create a 2D table dp with dimensions (N+1) x (M+1), where N and M are the lengths of str1 and str2 respectively, filled with zeros initially.
