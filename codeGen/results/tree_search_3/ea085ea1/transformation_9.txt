===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming: The problem can be solved by considering all possible substrings of str1 and checking if they are present in str2, then use a 2D array to keep track of the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far.
The state expression is dp[i][j] = 1 if the substring from i to i+1 in str1 matches a non-overlapping substring from j to j+1 in str2, otherwise it's 0.
dp[i][j] = 1 if the character at index i in str1 matches the character at index j in str2, and the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far is dp[i-1][j-1]
Use a 2D table to store the dynamic programming state dp[i][j], where i and j range from 0 to N-1.

The plan is correct, but it's missing an important detail: how to update the state transition. You'll need to decide when to increment the count of common non-overlapping substrings.
Also, consider the edge cases:
- What if str1 or str2 is empty?
- What if there are no common non-overlapping substrings?

To improve the plan, you can add more details on how to update the state transition and handle edge cases. You may also want to consider a bottom-up approach where you start by solving smaller subproblems and gradually build up to the final solution.
