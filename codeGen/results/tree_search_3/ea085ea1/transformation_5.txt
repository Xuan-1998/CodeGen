===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming: The problem can be solved by considering all possible substrings of str1 and checking if they are present in str2, then use a 2D array to keep track of the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings found so far.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings ending at index i in str1 and j in str2.
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 if str1[:i] and str2[:j] have the same substring at index i-1 and j-1

Initialize a 2D array with zeros and fill it in column by column.
