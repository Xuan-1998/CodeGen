The overall approach you've described is correct, using a sliding window and dynamic programming to solve this problem. Here are some specific thoughts on each step:

* **Sliding window approach**: This is a good idea, as it allows us to efficiently explore all possible substrings within the two strings.
* **State**: Your proposal for the state as a 2D table storing whether there exists a common substring of length i-j is also correct. This can be used to build up the solution iteratively.
* **Two-pointer approach**: Using two pointers, one starting from the beginning and one from the end of the strings, will allow us to efficiently check for common substrings within the window.

Some potential issues with this plan include:

* **Edge cases**: You haven't explicitly mentioned how you'll handle edge cases such as when the strings are empty or have different lengths. You should consider these scenarios in your implementation.
* **Memoization**: Since this problem involves looking up previous results to avoid redundant computation, memoization could be a useful technique to improve performance.

To further improve this plan, you might consider:

* **Preprocessing**: Before starting the dynamic programming process, you could preprocess the input strings to reduce the number of possible substrings being considered. For example, you could sort the characters in each string and then only consider substrings that start at positions where the corresponding characters are equal.
* **Optimizations**: Depending on the specific constraints of this problem (e.g., whether N is very small or there are any additional restrictions), you might be able to optimize certain parts of your algorithm to make it more efficient.

Overall, I think your plan is a good starting point for solving this problem. With some careful consideration of edge cases and potential optimizations, you should be able to come up with an efficient solution.
