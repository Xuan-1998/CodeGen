===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization: Create a memoization table where each cell represents the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for two given strings. Fill this table by iterating over all possible substrings and checking if they are present in both input strings, then use this table to find the solution at the end.

Define the state expression as a set of tuples (i, j) representing the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. The base case is when i == j = 0, then the answer is an empty set.

Define the state expression as a set of tuples (i, j) representing the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j]. Then define the transition relationships based on whether the current character in str1 is the same as the current character in str2 or not.

Use a nested loop structure to fill the dynamic programming table by iterating over all possible substrings of the input strings, and check if each substring is present in both input strings.
