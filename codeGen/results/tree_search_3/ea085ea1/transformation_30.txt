===BEGIN ANALYSIS===
The plan you've outlined is a good starting point for solving this problem. Here are some observations and suggestions to improve it:

* Memoization: Your idea of using memoization is correct. You're right that dynamic programming can be used to solve this problem.
* State expression: Your definition of the state expression as a set of tuples (i, j) representing the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings between str1[:i] and str2[:j] is also correct. This is a standard approach in dynamic programming problems where you need to consider overlapping subproblems.
* Base case: Your base case that when i == j = 0, then the answer is an empty set is correct.

However, here are some potential issues with your plan:

* Edge cases: You haven't considered edge cases like when one string is a prefix of another or vice versa. You should consider these edge cases separately.
* Overlapping substrings: Your plan doesn't explicitly handle overlapping substrings. You need to ensure that you're not counting the same substring multiple times.

To improve your plan, here are some suggestions:

* Define a recursive function to calculate the maximum number of common non-overlapping substrings for two given strings. The base case should be when i == j = 0.
* Use memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.
* Handle edge cases separately, like when one string is a prefix of another or vice versa.

Here's an updated version of your plan:
