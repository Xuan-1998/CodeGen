Your initial plan looks good, but I would suggest some improvements to make it more efficient and correct.

Firstly, you are right that dynamic programming with memoization can be used to solve this problem. The idea of using a sliding window approach to find common substrings is also a great starting point.

However, there are a few potential issues with your plan:

1. **Handling edge cases**: You mentioned that the base case would be when one of the positions reaches the end of its respective string. That's correct, but you should also consider what happens if one string is shorter than the other. For example, if str1 has length N and str2 has length M where M < N, then you should stop considering substrings as soon as you reach the end of str2.

2. **Memoization**: You mentioned storing the results of subproblems to reuse them when needed. However, you didn't specify what exactly you would store in your memoization table. For example, would it be the length of common substrings found so far? Or would it be a boolean indicating whether there are any common substrings at all?

3. **Optimizations**: You can further optimize your plan by only considering substrings that are truly non-overlapping. For example, if you've already found a substring of length L in str1 and str2, then you don't need to consider substrings of length L+1 or longer because they would overlap with the previously found substring.

Overall, your initial plan is on the right track, but there are some details that need to be ironed out. With these suggestions, I think you can come up with a more efficient and correct solution.
