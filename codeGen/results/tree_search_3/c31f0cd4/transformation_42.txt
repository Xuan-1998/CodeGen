===BEGIN PLAN===

A top-down approach with memoization could be effective in solving this problem by recursively generating subsets and their corresponding sums, then storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.

The state expression could be an integer (current_sum) representing the sum of all subsets seen so far. 

Maintaining a hash map to store the sums generated so far and their corresponding frequencies can help in efficiently counting the number of subsets that generate each sum. This hash map will be used to store the results of subproblems.

The approach could start by initializing an empty hashmap (sum_freq_map) to store the frequency of each sum, then iterate through all possible subsets using a recursive function. 

For each subset, calculate its sum and check if it is already present in the hashmap. If not, add the sum as a new key in the hashmap with the current subset as its value. Then, for each existing sum in the hashmap, increment its frequency by 1.

To generate all possible subsets efficiently, use a recursive function that iterates through the given set of integers (a1, a2, ..., aN), and for each integer ai, recursively generates all subsets containing ai and all subsets not containing ai. 

This approach will ensure that all distinct sums are generated and their frequencies counted without redundant calculations.

Finally, sort the hashmap by its keys (sums) in ascending order to get the output list of distinct sums in increasing order.
