===BEGIN PLAN===
A top-down approach with memoization could be effective in solving this problem by recursively generating subsets and their corresponding sums, then storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.

The state expression could be an integer (current_sum) representing the sum of all subsets seen so far. This current_sum would be updated at each recursive step as we explore different subsets.

Using a 2D DP table with rows for each subset size and columns for each number in the set, where dp[i][j] represents the sum of all subsets containing j as the maximum value.

To fill up this 2D DP table, for every subset size i and every number j in the set, calculate the sum of all subsets that contain j as the maximum value. This could be done by considering all possible subsets of size (i-1) that do not include j, and then adding j to each of these subsets.

Use memoization to store intermediate results so that we don't need to recalculate them later on.

To output the final result, iterate over the 2D DP table in row-major order, starting from the top-left corner. For each cell dp[i][j], if it's not the same as the previous one (i.e., j is the maximum value), add j to the output list and continue with the next cell.

This plan handles edge cases well because it considers all possible subsets of different sizes. It also avoids redundant calculations using memoization, which would greatly reduce its time complexity.

However, there's still a potential issue with this plan: what if the input set contains duplicate numbers? The DP table could end up storing duplicate subset sums, which might not be desirable. To handle this case, we could modify the plan to only store unique subset sums in the DP table.

Overall, this top-down approach with memoization looks like a promising way to solve this problem. It has the potential to reduce time complexity by avoiding redundant calculations and it handles edge cases well.
