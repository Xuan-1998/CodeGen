===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

Base case: Since the problem requires distinct sums, set up a base case for empty subsets (i.e., initial state).

Use a set to store unique sums found so far, and iterate over all possible subsets to compute new sums.
