===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation might not be the best choice for this problem as it would require initializing a 2D array to store the intermediate results and calculating the cumulative sums, which could lead to unnecessary complexity.

To define the state as a subset of integers and its corresponding sum, and the base case as the empty set with a sum of 0.
This is a good starting point. The state space can be represented as tuples (subset, sum), where the subset is a list of integers and the sum is the cumulative sum.

Formulate the transition relationship by considering all possible subsets that can be formed by adding or removing an element from the current subset, and calculate the corresponding sums.
This is a good approach. The key insight here is to recognize that the sum of a subset is monotonically increasing as you add more elements. This allows us to prune the state space by only considering subsets that have not been seen before.

The transition relation can be represented as a function that takes the current state and returns a list of new states.
This is a good idea. The function should return a list of tuples (subset, sum) representing the next possible subsets and their corresponding sums.

Consider using memoization with dictionary data structure to store previously computed sums.
This is a great idea! Memoization can help avoid recomputing the same sums multiple times, which would greatly improve the time complexity of the solution.
