===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

Base case: Since the problem requires distinct sums, set up a base case for empty subsets (i.e., initial state). The base case is 0, since the sum of an empty subset is 0. This means we don't need to store any values in the memoization array for this base case.

Define the state as the subset of integers being considered, and the transition relationship as adding or removing an integer from the subset. Specifically, let dp[i][sum] represent the number of subsets of the first i integers that sum up to sum.

Create a 2D array with dimensions (N+1) x (sum + 1), where N is the size of the input set, and initialize it with zeros. This is because we need to consider sums from 0 to the total sum of all integers in the set. Then, fill up the array by iterating over the input set and updating the values based on the dynamic programming recurrence.

The recurrence relation can be formulated as follows: for each integer i in the set and each possible sum j:

* If j is less than or equal to ai, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + 1 (add 1 to the number of subsets that sum up to j when including ai)
* Otherwise, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] (do not include ai in any subset that sums up to j)

To generate all distinct sums, iterate over the array and print out the indices that have a value greater than 0.
