Your plan looks good, but there are some minor improvements that can be made to make it more robust.

The base case for empty subsets is correct. You need to initialize an empty set or array to store the distinct sums.

The state and transition relationship you've defined are also correct. The state should indeed be the subset of integers being considered, and the transition relationship should involve adding or removing an integer from the subset.

Using a nested loop structure to recursively generate all possible combinations of the given set is a good approach. However, to optimize this process, you can consider using bit manipulation to generate subsets instead of iterating through each element in the set.

To keep track of distinct sums, you are correct that a set data structure would be suitable. This ensures that duplicates are automatically removed and only unique sums are stored.

One potential issue with your plan is that it does not account for edge cases. For instance, what if the input set contains duplicate elements? How would you handle this case?

Another improvement could be to use a priority queue or sorted list to store the distinct sums in increasing order, rather than just storing them as a set.

Overall, your plan shows good understanding of the problem and dynamic programming concepts. With some minor tweaks, it can be made more robust and efficient.
