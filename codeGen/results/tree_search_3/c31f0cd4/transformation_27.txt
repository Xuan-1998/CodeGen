===BEGIN PLAN===
A top-down approach with memoization could be effective in solving this problem by recursively generating subsets and their corresponding sums, then storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.

The state expression could be a tuple (subset_sum, subset_index) where subset_sum is the sum of elements in the current subset and subset_index is the index of the last element added to the subset. This would allow us to track the cumulative sum of elements up to a given position and the transition relationship defined by the possible subsets that can be formed by adding an element at each step.

However, it's important to note that using recursion for this problem might lead to high time complexity due to repeated calculations. A more efficient approach could be a bottom-up dynamic programming approach.

The state representation in this case could be a dictionary where the key is the current cumulative sum and the value is a list of distinct sums that can be generated from subsets ending at this point.

The transition relationship would involve iterating over each element, calculating its possible subset combinations (including no element added), and recursively generating all possible subsets for each combination. The memoized results could then be used to avoid redundant calculations and store the intermediate results.

Edge cases should also be considered, such as when the input set is empty or contains a single element, where the problem becomes trivial.

To further improve this plan, we can consider using a priority queue to prioritize the calculation of subsets based on their cumulative sum. This could help reduce the time complexity by avoiding unnecessary calculations.

Finally, it's crucial to test the correctness of the solution with various edge cases and sample inputs to ensure its robustness.
