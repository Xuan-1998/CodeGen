===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

State expression: Define dp[i][j] as the maximum value of sums that can be obtained by adding ai to any existing subset and its complement. However, since we need to find all distinct sums, not just the maximum, we should reconsider our state expression. A better approach would be to define dp[i][j] as the set of sums that can be obtained by adding ai to any existing subset.

Use a hashmap to store the subsets and their corresponding sums, then iterate over all possible combinations of subsets and calculate the total sum. This is a good start, but we need to clarify how we will use the hashmap and what kind of combinations we will consider.

Applying memoization using a dictionary where the key is the current subset and the value is the corresponding sum. This is a good idea, as it will help us avoid redundant calculations.

Here's an updated plan:
