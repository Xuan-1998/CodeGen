===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation might not be the best choice for this problem as it would require initializing a 2D array to store the intermediate results and calculating the cumulative sums, which could lead to unnecessary complexity.

To define the state as a subset of integers and its corresponding sum, and the base case as the empty set with a sum of 0. This is a good start, as it provides a clear definition of the problem's dynamic programming state.

Formulate the transition relationship by considering all possible subsets that can be formed by adding or removing an element from the current subset, and calculate the corresponding sums. The transition relation can be represented as a function that takes the current state and returns a list of new states.

However, there might be some issues with this approach. For example, if we consider all possible subsets, including those with duplicate elements or empty subsets, it might lead to an exponential number of states. We need to find a way to prune the search space effectively.

To improve the plan, we can consider using bit manipulation to represent the subsets and their corresponding sums. This would reduce the number of states significantly.

Use dynamic programming by constructing a table of subsets and their corresponding sums, and fill this table iteratively from left to right. This is a good approach, as it allows us to build up the solutions for smaller subsets and combine them to form larger subsets.

One potential issue with this plan is that it might still require a large amount of memory to store all the intermediate results. We need to find a way to reduce the space complexity.

Finally, let's not forget to handle edge cases such as an empty input or an input with only one element. In these cases, the output would be a list containing a single sum (0 for an empty input and the single element for an input with only one element).
