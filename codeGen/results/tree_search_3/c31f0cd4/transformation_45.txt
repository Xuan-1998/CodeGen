The bottom-up approach with tabulation might not be the best choice for this problem as it would require initializing a 2D array to store the intermediate results and calculating the cumulative sums, which could lead to unnecessary complexity.

To define the state as a subset of integers and its corresponding sum, and the base case as the empty set with a sum of 0.

Define the state as a combination of a subset of integers and its corresponding sum, and the base case as the empty set with a sum of 0. The state can be represented by a tuple (subset_sum, subset) where subset_sum is the sum of the elements in the subset and subset is the actual subset.

Implement memoization by defining a function that takes a subset of integers as input, calculates its sum, and stores the result in a dictionary for future references.
