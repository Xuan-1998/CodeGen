===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

State expression: Define dp[i][j] as the maximum value of sums that can be obtained by adding ai to any existing subset and its complement

Consider using a 2D array dp[i][sum] where i represents the current integer and sum is the cumulative sum, then use transitions to update the states

Create a 2D table dp[i][j] where i ranges from 0 to N (where N is the given number of integers) and j ranges from 0 to sum_of_all_integers, representing the cumulative sum.

Potential issues:
* The plan does not consider whether the current subset includes or excludes the integer ai. This could lead to incorrect results.
* The plan does not account for the order in which subsets are generated. This could also lead to incorrect results.
* There is no mention of how to generate all possible subsets and their complements.

Improved plan:
Create a 2D table dp[i][j] where i ranges from 0 to N (where N is the given number of integers) and j ranges from 0 to sum_of_all_integers, representing the cumulative sum.
Use a helper function to generate all possible subsets of the given set, including their complements.

For each subset, calculate its sum and use it to update the table dp[i][j].
To account for the order in which subsets are generated, consider using a priority queue or a sorted list to store the subsets before calculating their sums.
Consider adding an additional dimension to the 2D array dp[i][j] to keep track of whether each subset includes or excludes the current integer ai.

Edge cases:
* Handle the case where N is 0. In this case, there are no integers and therefore no distinct sums can be generated.
* Handle the case where all integers have the same value. In this case, all subsets will have the same sum, so only one distinct sum needs to be reported.
