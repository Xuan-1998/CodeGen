===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

State expression: Define dp[i][j] as the maximum value of sums that can be obtained by adding ai to any existing subset and its complement
Define state as the current subset and the remaining integers, transition by adding or removing integers from the subset and updating the resulting sum

Use a tabulation approach where you create a 2D table dp[n][sum] and fill it up row by row, where dp[i][j] is the maximum value of sums that can be obtained by adding ai to any existing subset and its complement
