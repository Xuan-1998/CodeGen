===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation might not be the best choice for this problem as it would require initializing a 2D array to store the intermediate results and calculating the cumulative sums, which could lead to unnecessary complexity.

To define the state as the current integer being processed and the sum up to this point, and the base case as when all integers have been processed.
This is a good approach. By focusing on the current integer and the sum up to that point, you can simplify the problem and avoid calculating unnecessary sums.

Define the state as the subset of integers processed so far and the current sum, and the base case as when all subsets have been considered.
This is also a good approach. By keeping track of the subset of integers processed so far and the current sum, you can generate all possible subsets and their corresponding sums.

Create a dictionary to store the intermediate results where the key is the tuple of integers in the subset and the value is the corresponding sum.
This is a good idea. Storing the intermediate results in a dictionary will allow you to quickly look up the sum for a given subset, which can help with memoization and reduce redundant calculations.

However, there are a few potential issues with this plan:

* You may need to handle the case where two different subsets have the same elements but in a different order. This could be handled by sorting the subset before using it as a key in your dictionary.
* You should also consider how you will handle edge cases such as when all integers are negative or zero, or when there is only one integer.
* You may need to add additional logic to ensure that you don't generate duplicate subsets (e.g. if you're generating subsets of 1 through 3, you shouldn't include the subset [1, 2] in your results because it's equivalent to the subset [2, 1]).
