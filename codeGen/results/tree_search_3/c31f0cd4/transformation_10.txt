===BEGIN PLAN REVISION===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

===CORRECTION AND EXPANSION OF BASE CASE===
Instead of considering only empty subsets (i.e., initial state), we should also consider the base case where there is one element in the subset. This will help us to calculate the sum values for single-element subsets, which will be used as building blocks to calculate sums for larger subsets.

===ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON MEMOIZATION===
To effectively apply memoization by storing intermediate results, we can use a dictionary to store previously computed sum values as states. We should also consider the order in which we generate the subsets and their corresponding sums. For instance, if we generate subsets with smaller sums first, this might help us avoid recalculating the same subset multiple times.

===EDGE CASES AND POTENTIAL ISSUES WITH THE PLAN===
We should ensure that our plan can handle edge cases such as:
- What happens when there is only one element in the set?
- How do we handle duplicate elements in the set?
- Are there any special cases for subsets with a specific number of elements (e.g., 1, 2)?

===FINAL PLAN WITH FURTHER EXPANSION===
Now that we have revised and expanded our plan, here's an outline of the steps:
