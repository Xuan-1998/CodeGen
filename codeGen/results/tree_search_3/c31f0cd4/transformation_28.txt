===BEGIN PLAN===
A top-down approach with memoization could be effective in solving this problem by recursively generating subsets and their corresponding sums, then storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.

The state expression could be a tuple (subset_sum, subset_index) where subset_sum is the sum of elements in the current subset and subset_index is the index of the last element added to the subset. However, it might be more efficient to use a single variable representing the cumulative sum up to that point.

Consider using a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming, where the state represents the cumulative sum of elements up to a given position and the transition relationship is defined by the possible subsets that can be formed by adding an element at each step. This would allow us to avoid redundant calculations and take advantage of the properties of the problem.

To improve the plan, consider using a dictionary to store previously computed values and look them up as needed, effectively avoiding redundant computations. This could be done by iterating over the input set and for each element, checking if there are any subsets that can be formed without that element, then adding the current element to those subsets and updating the sums.

One potential issue with the plan is that it might not handle edge cases correctly. For example, what happens when the input set contains negative numbers? Would we need to add some additional logic to handle these cases?

Another potential issue is that the plan does not explicitly handle the case where a subset is empty (i.e., no elements are added). We would need to consider this case and decide how to handle it.

Some edge cases to consider:
- What if the input set contains negative numbers?
- What if the input set contains duplicate elements?
- What if the input set is empty?
