The overall approach you've outlined seems correct, as it identifies the problem as one that can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea to use a hash map (dictionary) to store the cumulative sums and their frequencies is also a good start.

However, there are some areas that could be improved upon:

* You don't specify how exactly you plan to iterate over the integers and calculate the cumulative sums. Will you be iterating over each integer once? If so, will you be using a single pass or multiple passes?
* You mention calculating the frequencies of the cumulative sums, but you don't clarify what you'll do with these frequencies once they're calculated.
* The base case is mentioned as when all integers have been processed. However, it's not clear how this base case relates to the problem at hand.

To further improve your plan, I would suggest adding more specific details about each step and making sure that the plan includes edge cases.

Some potential issues with the current plan include:

* What if there are duplicate integers in the input set? How will you handle these duplicates?
* Are there any special cases that need to be handled (e.g. what if one of the integers is 0)?

Finally, it's not clear from your plan whether the output should contain the distinct sums or all possible sums.

Overall, I think your plan has some good ideas, but could benefit from a bit more detail and consideration of edge cases.
