Your plan looks good overall, but let's break down each step to ensure we're on the right track.

Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach: This is a great idea. Memoization can help us avoid redundant computations and reduce the time complexity of our solution.

State expression: Define dp[i][j] as the maximum value of sums that can be obtained by adding ai to any existing subset and its complement: I'm not entirely sure what you mean by "the maximum value of sums that can be obtained by adding ai to any existing subset and its complement". Could you clarify this step? Are we trying to find the maximum sum for each subset, or something else?

Consider using a 2D array dp[i][sum] where i represents the current integer and sum is the cumulative sum: This is a good idea. Using a 2D array can help us keep track of all possible sums that can be generated from subsets.

Use a dictionary dp[i][sum] where i represents the current integer and sum is the cumulative sum.: I'm not sure why we need to use a dictionary here. Can you explain what you're trying to achieve with this step?
