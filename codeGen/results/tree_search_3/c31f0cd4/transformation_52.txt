===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation might not be the best choice for this problem as it would require initializing a 2D array to store the intermediate results and calculating the cumulative sums, which could lead to unnecessary complexity.

// Correct! Tabulation may not be the most efficient way to solve this problem. A recursive approach or memoization can be more suitable.

To define the state as a subset of integers and its corresponding sum, and the base case as the empty set with a sum of 0.
// Good start! This defines the problem statement clearly. However, it's important to specify what kind of subsets you're considering (e.g., all possible subsets, including empty sets).

Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by defining the state as the cumulative sum of all possible subsets and their corresponding sums. The base case would be the empty set with a sum of 0, and the recurrence relation would involve calculating the sum for each subset and updating the cumulative sum accordingly.
// Correct! This approach seems feasible. You're considering using dynamic programming to calculate the cumulative sums of all possible subsets.

Memoizing recursive function calls: Define a recursive function that generates all distinct sums by selecting or rejecting elements from the given set, and use memoization to avoid redundant calculations by storing the results of previously computed function calls.
// Good idea! Memoization can help reduce the time complexity of your solution. However, you should also consider the space complexity implications of memoizing.
