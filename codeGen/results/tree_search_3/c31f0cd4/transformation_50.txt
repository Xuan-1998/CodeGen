===BEGIN FEEDBACK===
Your intuition to approach this problem using Dynamic Programming is correct. Your plan to use memoization to store intermediate results is also a good idea.

However, I have some suggestions to improve and refine your plan:

1. Instead of defining the state as a subset of integers and its corresponding sum, consider defining the state as the current cumulative sum and whether it can be achieved by adding or removing an element from the previous subsets.
2. For the base case, you're correct that it would be the empty set with a sum of 0. However, you might also want to add a condition to handle the case where N is 0 (i.e., no elements in the set). In this case, the only possible sum is 0.
3. The recurrence relation can be refined by considering whether the current cumulative sum can be achieved by adding or removing an element from the previous subsets. If it can, then update the memoization dictionary accordingly.
4. To avoid unnecessary calculations, you might want to sort the set of integers before starting the dynamic programming process.

Here's a refined version of your plan:
