To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to generate all possible subsets of the given set, calculate their sums, and store them in a data structure. The state will be the current integer being processed and the sum up to this point.

The base case is when all integers have been processed. At this point, we have generated all possible subsets and calculated their sums.

Another approach would be to use a Trie data structure to efficiently generate and store the distinct subsets.

However, there might be a more efficient way to solve this problem by using dynamic programming with memoization. This approach can reduce the time complexity of the solution.

One potential issue is that we need to handle edge cases where the input set contains duplicates or has an empty subset. We should ensure that our solution correctly handles these cases and produces the expected output.
