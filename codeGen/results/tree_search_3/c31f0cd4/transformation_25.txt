===BEGIN PLAN ANALYSIS AND UPDATE===
Your plan seems to be on the right track, but there are a few areas that need further consideration:

1. **State Expression:** You've defined dp[i][j] as the maximum value of sums that can be obtained by adding ai to any existing subset and its complement. This is a good start, but you might want to consider defining dp[i][j] as the set of all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of [1..i] using integers up to j.

2. **State Transition:** Your plan focuses on adding or removing integers from the subset and updating the resulting sum. However, this might not be the most efficient approach, especially when dealing with larger inputs. You could consider a more straightforward approach: generate all possible subsets of the given set, calculate the sum for each subset, and store these sums in a dictionary.

3. **Memoization:** Your plan mentions using memoization to avoid redundant calculations. This is a great idea! By storing intermediate results in a dictionary, you can significantly reduce the time complexity of your solution.

4. **Edge Cases:** You should also consider edge cases, such as an empty input set or a single-element input set. In these cases, the problem's requirements would need to be reevaluated and possibly modified to accommodate the special scenarios.

Here is an updated plan that incorporates these suggestions:

===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming for the problem of finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.
State expression: Define dp[i][j] as the set of all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of [1..i] using integers up to j.

State: The current subset and the remaining integers.
Transition:
   - Generate all possible subsets of the given set
   - Calculate the sum for each subset
   - Store these sums in a dictionary

Memoization:
   - Use a dictionary to store intermediate results as you go through the subsets, avoiding redundant calculations when calculating larger sums.

Edge Cases:
   - Handle edge cases such as an empty input set or a single-element input set
   - Modify problem requirements if necessary
