===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

State expression: Define dp[sum][remaining_integers] as the number of ways to get sum by adding up some integers from remaining_integers

Define state as the current sum and the remaining integers, transition by adding or removing an integer from the set, updating the resulting sum accordingly

Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where you iterate over all possible sums from 0 to sum_of_all_integers, and for each sum, update a dictionary with the number of ways to get that sum. Iterate over all possible subsets of the given set and check if it's possible to obtain each sum by adding up some integers from the subset. If yes, increment the count of that sum in your dictionary

Handle edge cases: If the input is an empty set, return a list containing 0. If the input contains a single integer, return a list containing that integer.
