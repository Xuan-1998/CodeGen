===BEGIN PLAN===
The plan you've proposed seems to be a good starting point for solving this problem. Here are some thoughts on how to improve it:

* The state definition of the binary representation of the subset's sum is a great idea! This can help reduce the complexity of the problem.
* Using a two-pointer technique to generate all possible subsets of the input set and calculate their sums is also a good approach.

However, there are a few potential issues with your plan:

* The base case you mentioned seems to be missing. You should specify what the threshold value is and how it will help in solving the problem.
* You didn't mention how you would handle duplicates in the subsets. This could lead to some unnecessary complexity if not handled properly.
* There's no clear indication of how you plan to generate all possible subsets using a two-pointer technique.

Here's an updated version of your plan with these issues addressed:
