===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

DP states: Consider using a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the sums that can be generated using the first i elements with a sum of j.

Determine if there's a way to break down the problem into smaller subproblems that share common solutions, allowing you to build up your dynamic programming solution. 

Use tabulation by initializing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is True if the sum j can be generated from the first i elements, and False otherwise.
