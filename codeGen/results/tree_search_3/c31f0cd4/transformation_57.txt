===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem requires you to find all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

To define the state, let's consider each possible subset of the given set. For each subset, we need to calculate the sum. The current integer being processed is the next element in the subset, and the sum up to this point is the sum of all elements in the subset so far. This means that when processing a subset, we know its last element (current integer), and we can calculate its sum by adding the current integer to the sum of all previous elements.

The base case would be when all integers have been processed, meaning there are no more subsets to generate sums from.

To solve this problem using dynamic programming, maintain a set of all possible sums that can be generated from the given set of integers. This way, you don't need to recalculate the same sum multiple times. 

Initially, add the individual elements of the set to the set of unique sums. Then, for each pair of elements in the set (which are not already included in a subset), check if they can be added together without exceeding the maximum value. If so, add their sum to the set.

This approach ensures that all possible sums are generated and that duplicate sums are avoided.

To handle edge cases: 
- Check for empty input sets.
- Check for sets with only one element (in which case there is only one unique sum).
- Check if any of the elements in the set exceed the maximum value. If yes, adjust the sum accordingly to ensure it's within the range.

This plan should give you a good starting point for solving this problem using dynamic programming.
