===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

DP states: Consider using a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the sums that can be generated using the first i elements with a sum of j. This will allow us to keep track of the dynamic programming solutions as we iterate through the sets and their corresponding sums.

However, this approach might not be optimal because it doesn't take into account the property of subset sums being commutative (i.e., the order in which you include or exclude elements from a set does not affect the sum). To address this, consider using a dictionary where keys are sums and values are lists of subsets that can generate those sums. This will allow us to keep track of the distinct sums generated by different subsets.

To further improve the plan, consider iterating through the sets in lexicographic order (i.e., smallest to largest) when generating subsets. This is because we're interested in finding all possible sums, not just the minimum or maximum.

To handle edge cases, make sure to include checks for empty sets and single-element sets. In these cases, there will only be one subset that can generate a sum of 0 (for an empty set) or equal to the single element itself (for a single-element set).

The updated plan:
