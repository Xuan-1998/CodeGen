===BEGIN PLAN===
The approach you're suggesting is to use dynamic programming with memoization. This can be a good choice for this problem.

Your state definition, "the binary representation of the subset's sum", is interesting. It's not immediately clear how this would help, but it could potentially simplify the calculation of distinct sums by allowing you to compare subsets based on their cumulative sums.

The base case, when the sum is less than or equal to a given threshold, makes sense if you're going to be calculating distinct sums for all possible subset sums. This could help reduce the number of calculations needed.

Defining the transition relationship as "the addition or removal of an element from the current subset" also seems like a good approach. This would allow you to generate new subsets and calculate their cumulative sums in a relatively efficient manner.

Using memoization by defining a recursive function that calculates the distinct sums and stores the results in a dictionary is a great idea. This can help prevent redundant calculations and make your program more efficient.

Overall, I think your plan has some good ideas in it. One potential issue to consider is how you would handle edge cases, such as when the input set contains duplicate elements or when the threshold for distinct sums is very high.

Here's an updated version of your plan with some additional suggestions and considerations:
