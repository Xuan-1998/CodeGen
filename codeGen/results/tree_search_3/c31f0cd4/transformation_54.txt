Your plan is correct, but there are some potential issues that need to be addressed.

Firstly, you're right that using a 2D array might not be the best approach. Since each subset of integers can generate multiple sums, we don't need to store all intermediate results. We can simply use a set to keep track of unique sums as we generate them.

However, there's one potential issue with your plan: you didn't specify how to generate these subsets and calculate their corresponding sums. This is the core part of your problem-solving strategy, and it needs to be fleshed out more.

One way to approach this would be to use a recursive function that takes a subset of integers and calculates its sum. We can start with an empty subset and recursively add each integer to the subset until we've processed all integers. For each subset, we calculate its sum and add it to our set of unique sums.

Another potential issue is edge cases. What if the input contains duplicate integers? How will this affect your solution?

Overall, your plan has a good starting point, but it needs more detail and consideration for edge cases.
