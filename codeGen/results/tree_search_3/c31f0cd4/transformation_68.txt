===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation might not be the best choice for this problem as it would require initializing a 2D array to store the intermediate results and calculating the cumulative sums, which could lead to unnecessary complexity.

**Correct!**

The state can be defined as the binary representation of the subset's sum, and the base case is when the sum is less than or equal to a given threshold.

**Good approach!**

To view each possible subset sum as a unique state, and the transition relationship as the generation of all subsets by adding or removing elements from the previous subsets.

**Correct!**

You can consider using a bit manipulation approach to generate all distinct subset sums from the given set, by iterating over the powerset of the input set and calculating the sum for each subset.

**Good idea!**

However, there is one potential issue with the plan: it might not be efficient enough. The powerset of the input set can grow exponentially with the size of the input, which could lead to a time complexity that is too high for this problem.

To improve the plan, you could consider using a more efficient way to generate the subset sums, such as using dynamic programming or memoization to avoid recalculating the same subsets multiple times.

Additionally, you should also consider edge cases, such as what happens if the input set is empty or contains only one element. In these cases, the problem statement does not specify what the output should be, so you would need to decide on a default behavior or handle these cases specially.

**Edge case consideration:**
- Handle the case when the input set is empty.
- Handle the case when the input set contains only one element.

Overall, your plan has some good ideas and approaches, but it could be improved by considering more efficient ways to generate subset sums and handling edge cases properly.
