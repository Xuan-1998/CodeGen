===BEGIN PLAN===
The proposed plan for solving this problem involves a dynamic programming approach using tabulation.

1. Define the state:
    The state can be defined as the binary representation of the subset's sum, which allows us to consider the subsets of the input set as states in our dynamic programming approach.
2. Base case:
    The base case is when the sum is less than or equal to a given threshold. This ensures that we don't get stuck in an infinite loop.

3. Dynamic Programming:
    Initialize a dictionary (DP) to store the intermediate results and calculate the cumulative sums by iterating through the binary representation of the subset's sum.

    For each subset sum, iterate over all possible subsets and their corresponding sums.
    If the current subset sum is less than or equal to the threshold, add it to the DP dictionary along with its corresponding subsets.

4. Final Answer:
    Return a list of unique sums from the DP dictionary.
