===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

DP states: Consider using a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the sums that can be generated using the first i elements with a sum of j.
Consider using a recursive approach to build the dynamic programming solution, where each state represents the subsets of the given set that can be generated up to a certain sum.

Implementing a recursive function to generate all possible subsets of the given set and calculate their corresponding sums, then use memoization to store the results and avoid repeated computations.
