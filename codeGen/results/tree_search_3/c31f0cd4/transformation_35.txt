===BEGIN PLAN===
A top-down approach with memoization could be effective in solving this problem by recursively generating subsets and their corresponding sums, then storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.

The state expression could be a tuple (subset_sum, subset_index) where subset_sum is the sum of elements in the current subset and subset_index is the index of the last element added to the subset.

A hash-based approach could be effective in solving this problem, where the state represents the current cumulative sum and the transition relationship is defined by storing the sums of all possible subsets that can be formed from the given set.

Hash-based Memoization: Use a hash table to store the cumulative sums and their corresponding subset sums, allowing for efficient lookup and calculation.
