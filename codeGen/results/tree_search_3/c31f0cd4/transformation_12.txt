===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

// Base case: Since the problem requires distinct sums, set up a base case for empty subsets (i.e., initial state).
Let S be the set of integers. Initialize an empty dictionary memo with key-value pairs where keys are possible sums and values are lists of subsets that generate those sums.
Base case: For the empty subset (), add 0 to the memo with an empty list as its value.

// Define the state as the subset of integers being considered, and the transition relationship as adding or removing an integer from the subset.
For each number in S:
    // Calculate the sum for this number and all previous numbers in the current subset.
    For each possible subset that includes this number:
        Add the calculated sum to the memo with a list containing this subset and any previously stored subsets that generate the same sum.

// Use a dictionary to store the computed sums as keys and their corresponding subsets as values.
Let res be an empty set to store the distinct sums.
For each key-value pair in memo:
    // If the value is not empty, it means there are multiple subsets that generate this sum. Add only one of them to the result set.
    For the first subset in the value:
        Add the corresponding sum to the res.

// Return the result set as a list of distinct sums in increasing order.
Return sorted(list(res))
