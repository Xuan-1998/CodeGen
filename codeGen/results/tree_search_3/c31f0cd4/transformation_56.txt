===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation might not be the best choice for this problem as it would require initializing a 2D array to store the intermediate results and calculating the cumulative sums, which could lead to unnecessary complexity.

// Good start! You're correctly identifying that the traditional dynamic programming approach might not be suitable for this problem. Instead of using a 2D array, let's think about how we can use a single list or data structure to keep track of the cumulative sums.

To define the state as the current integer being processed and the sum up to this point, and the base case as when all integers have been processed.

// This is a good way to frame the problem in terms of dynamic programming. The "state" refers to the current position in the list of integers, and the "base case" is when we've reached the end of the list.

Use dynamic programming to maintain a set of all possible sums that can be generated from the given set of integers.

// This is a good high-level goal for our algorithm. Let's think about how we can use dynamic programming to achieve this.

To use a list to keep track of the cumulative sums and update the results accordingly.

// Using a list or data structure to keep track of the cumulative sums is a great idea! This will allow us to efficiently generate all possible sums from the given set of integers.
