===BEGIN PLAN===

Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

State expression: Define dp[i][j] as the maximum value of sums that can be obtained by adding ai to any existing subset and its complement. However, this state expression seems incorrect because it's not clear how to calculate the maximum sum or why we need a two-dimensional array.

Instead, consider defining dp[j] as the set of distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set with a total sum of j. This way, we can use dynamic programming to build up the solution by iterating over all possible subset sums and their corresponding combinations of numbers.

Use a hashmap to store the subsets and their corresponding sums, then iterate over all possible combinations of subsets and calculate the total sum. However, this approach seems inefficient because it requires generating all possible subsets and calculating their sums, which can be exponential in terms of the number of elements.

A better approach is to use dynamic programming with a one-dimensional array dp where dp[j] represents the set of distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set with a total sum of j. We can initialize dp[0] as the empty set, then iterate over all numbers in the set and for each number ai, update dp[j] to include the sum j-ai if it is not already present in dp[j].
