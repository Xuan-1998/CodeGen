===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation might not be the best choice for this problem as it would require initializing a 2D array to store the intermediate results and calculating the cumulative sums, which could lead to unnecessary complexity.

To define the state as the current integer being processed and the sum up to this point, and the base case as when all integers have been processed.
Use dynamic programming to maintain a set of all possible sums that can be generated from the given set of integers.
To use a dictionary to store the intermediate results and calculate the cumulative sums.
