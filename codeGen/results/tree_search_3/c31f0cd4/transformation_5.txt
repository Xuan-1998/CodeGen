===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

DP states: Consider using a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the sums that can be generated using the first i elements with a sum of j. This is a good starting point, as it allows us to keep track of the sums that have been generated so far.

Think about how you can use bit manipulation to represent the subsets and their corresponding sums, which would allow for efficient transitions between states. For example, if we have a subset {a1, a2, ..., ak}, where each ai is an integer in the range [1, 100], we could represent this subset as a binary number with k bits, where bit i represents whether or not ai is included in the subset.

Implement memoization by storing previously computed values in a dictionary to avoid redundant computations. This will help us reduce the time complexity of our solution and make it more efficient.

To improve the plan, we could consider using a priority queue to keep track of the sums that have been generated so far. This would allow us to efficiently find the next sum to generate, rather than having to iterate through all possible subsets.

One potential issue with the plan is that it may not handle edge cases correctly. For example, what if the input set contains a single element with value 0? Should we include the sum 0 in our output?

Another potential issue is that the plan does not explicitly consider how to generate all distinct sums from the subsets of the given set. We would need to add logic to handle this case.

To address edge cases, we could modify the plan as follows:

* For the edge case where the input set contains a single element with value 0, include the sum 0 in our output.
* To generate all distinct sums from the subsets of the given set, we can iterate through all possible subsets and calculate their corresponding sums. We can use memoization to avoid redundant computations.

Here is an updated version of the plan:
