===BEGIN PLAN REVISION===
A top-down approach with memoization could be effective in solving this problem by recursively generating subsets and their corresponding sums, then storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.

The state expression could be refined as a tuple (subset_sum, remaining_elements) where subset_sum is the sum of elements in the current subset and remaining_elements is the list of indices still left to choose from. This allows for easier tracking of the possible subsets and their corresponding sums.

The approach you've described is correct, but there are some potential issues that need to be addressed:

* The plan does not explicitly handle edge cases such as when N (the number of integers) or a particular ai is zero.
* To improve the plan, consider adding error handling for invalid inputs. For example, if the input contains non-integer values, return an error message or set a flag indicating that the input was invalid.

To further refine the approach:

* Initialize the memoization dictionary with base cases: the sum of an empty subset is 0, and the sum of a single-element subset is equal to that element.
* Iterate over all possible subsets by using recursion and backtracking. For each subset, calculate its sum and store it in the memoization dictionary if it's not already present.
* To avoid redundant calculations, use memoization to cache the results of subproblems as you solve them.
* Finally, iterate over the values in the memoization dictionary to generate the distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of the given set.
