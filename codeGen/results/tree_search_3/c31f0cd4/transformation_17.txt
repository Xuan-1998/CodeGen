===BEGIN ANALYSIS===
Your plan seems to be on the right track, but I have some suggestions for improvement:
1. The idea of using memoization is correct, as this problem does involve finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.
2. Your base case makes sense; setting up a base case for empty subsets (i.e., initial state) is a good approach.
3. Using a set to store unique sums found so far and iterating over all possible subsets to compute new sums is also correct.
4. The bit manipulation approach could be useful in generating subsets, but you might need to use it with caution to avoid duplicates.

Potential issues with the plan:
1. Edge cases: You should consider what happens when there are duplicate elements in the input set. This could affect the correctness of your solution.
2. Efficiency: Your plan involves iterating over all possible subsets, which could be time-consuming for large input sets. You might need to optimize your approach to improve efficiency.

Suggested improvements:
1. Consider using a different data structure instead of a set to store unique sums found so far. This could help with edge cases.
2. Use bit manipulation to efficiently generate subsets and avoid duplicates.
3. Implement an early termination strategy for edge cases where duplicate elements are present.
4. Optimize your approach to improve efficiency.

Overall, your plan has some good ideas, but it needs refinement to address potential issues and optimize performance.
