===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

Base case: Since the problem requires distinct sums, set up a base case for empty subsets (i.e., initial state). In this case, the sum would be 0. This is because an empty subset doesn't contribute to any sum.

Use a dictionary to store previously computed sum values as states. This will help in avoiding redundant computations and improve the time complexity of the solution.

Tabulating the solution using a 2D array: Initialize a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to get sum j by selecting elements from the first i numbers.

Potential issues with the plan:

- Edge case: The problem statement does not specify what to do if N is 0. In this case, there would be no integers in the set, so the function should probably return an empty list.
- Handling duplicates: If the input contains duplicate values, the solution should handle them correctly. This can be achieved by sorting the array and removing duplicates before processing it.

Improved plan:

1. Read the input N and the array of numbers a1, a2, ..., aN.
2. Initialize dp with all zeros and dp[0][j] = 1 if j is 0 (base case for empty subset).
3. Iterate through the elements in the set from left to right:
   * For each element ai, iterate through all possible sums j that can be generated using the first i numbers.
   * If j + ai can also be generated by selecting some elements from the set, then dp[i][j] should be 1.
4. After processing all elements, find and print all indices j in dp such that dp[N-1][j] is 1.

This plan will correctly solve the problem but it doesn't provide any guarantee about the time complexity. We can improve this by using a more efficient data structure for storing sums, like a hash set, which would have an average time complexity of O(1) and thus make the overall solution faster.
