===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

DP states: Consider using a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to get sum j using the first i elements. However, we should not count duplicate combinations, so we need to consider only unique sums.

Consider using a recursive approach to build the dynamic programming solution, where each state represents the subsets of the given set that can be generated up to a certain sum.

To improve the plan, consider sorting the input array and then iterating over it. For each element, calculate all possible sums that can be generated by adding this element to previously computed sums. This will help reduce the time complexity of the solution.

The potential issues with the plan are:
- The dynamic programming approach might not be efficient if the given set contains many repeated elements.
- We need to handle edge cases carefully, such as when the input array is empty or contains only one element.

Edge cases: 
- When the input array is empty, return an empty string or an empty list of sums.
- When the input array contains only one element, return a single-element array containing that element's value.
