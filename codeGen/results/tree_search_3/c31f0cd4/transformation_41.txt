===BEGIN PLAN===
A top-down approach with memoization could be effective in solving this problem by recursively generating subsets and their corresponding sums, then storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.

The state expression could be an integer (current_sum) representing the sum of all subsets seen so far.
Maintaining a hash map to store the sums generated so far and their corresponding frequencies.
You can use a dictionary to store the frequency of each sum, where the keys are the sums and the values are the counts.

This plan is mostly correct. Here's how you can improve it:

* You might need to consider the edge case where the input set contains only one element. In this case, there will be only one distinct sum which is that single element itself.
* To avoid redundant calculations, you should store the sums and their frequencies as you generate them. This way, when you encounter a subset with a sum that has already been generated, you can simply look it up in your hash map instead of recalculating it.
* You might want to consider sorting the distinct sums before printing them out. This will make sure they are printed out in increasing order.

Overall, this plan is a good start and with some minor adjustments, it should be able to solve the problem correctly. It's always a good idea to think about edge cases and potential issues when designing an algorithm.
