===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem statement suggests finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set. I think you're on the right track by considering dynamic programming.

Your plan is off to a good start, but there are a few areas that could be improved or clarified:

* You mention using a 2D array for tabulation, which isn't necessary in this case. A 1D array should suffice.
* The state definition as "the binary representation of the subset's sum" is interesting, but it might not be the most efficient way to approach the problem. You could also consider using the cumulative sum itself as the state variable.
* The base case you mentioned, "when the sum is less than or equal to a given threshold," is unclear. What would this threshold be? Would you need to calculate this threshold beforehand?
* Your transition relationship idea of adding or removing elements from the current subset to generate new subsets with distinct sums is correct. However, you'll need to think about how to efficiently keep track of these transitions.

Here's an updated plan that builds upon your ideas:
