===BEGIN PLAN===
A top-down approach with memoization could be effective in solving this problem by recursively generating subsets and their corresponding sums, then storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.

The state expression could be a tuple (subset_sum, subset_index) where subset_sum is the sum of elements in the current subset and subset_index is the index of the last element added to the subset.
This approach seems reasonable. The state representation captures the key information needed for recursive calculations: the sum of the current subset and the index of the last element.

A hash-based approach could be effective in solving this problem, where the state represents the current cumulative sum and the transition relationship is defined by storing the sums of all possible subsets that can be formed from the given set.
This approach also seems reasonable. The hash table can efficiently store the intermediate results, allowing for fast lookups and avoiding redundant calculations.

DP: Use a 2D table to store the dynamic programming table, where each cell dp[i][j] represents the sum of all distinct sums that can be generated using subsets of size j from the first i elements.
This is a good direction. The DP approach can efficiently solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems.

However, there are some potential issues with your plan:

* Edge cases: You should explicitly consider edge cases such as when N or ai is 0, negative, etc.
* Memoization: Make sure you memoize the results correctly to avoid redundant calculations. This can be done by storing the intermediate results in a hash table and checking if the result exists before calculating it again.

In general, your plan seems good, but there are some potential issues that need to be addressed. You should also consider edge cases and memoization carefully.
