===BEGIN PLAN===
The bottom-up approach with tabulation might not be the best choice for this problem as it would require initializing a 2D array to store the intermediate results and calculating the cumulative sums, which could lead to unnecessary complexity.

The state can be defined as the binary representation of the subset's sum. This is because we can represent each possible subset sum uniquely using its binary representation. For example, the binary representation of the subset sum 5 (which can be achieved by selecting elements 1 and 4 from the set {1, 2, 3, 4}) is "101".

The base case is when the sum is less than or equal to a given threshold. This is because we only need to consider sums that are within this threshold.

To view each possible subset sum as a unique state, and the transition relationship as the generation of all subsets by adding or removing elements from the previous subsets. For example, if we have already calculated the subset sums for the set {1, 2, 3}, we can generate the subset sums for the set {1, 2, 3, 4} by adding each element in the new set to each of the existing subset sums.

You can implement dynamic programming using a memoization dictionary to store previously computed sums. The keys would be the binary representation of the subset sum and the values would be lists of corresponding subset sums. This way, we avoid recalculating the same subset sums multiple times.

To improve the plan, you could consider using a more efficient data structure than a dictionary or list to store the memoized results. For example, you could use a Trie (prefix tree) to take advantage of the binary representation of the subset sums.

Potential issues with the plan include:

* What if the given set contains duplicate elements? Would this affect the correctness of the solution?
* How would we handle edge cases such as when the input set is empty or contains only one element?

To address these concerns, you could add additional checks and handling for these edge cases in your code.

In terms of edge cases:

* If the input set is empty, return an empty list.
* If the input set contains only one element, return a list containing that single element.

Overall, the plan seems to be on the right track. With some adjustments and additional considerations for edge cases, it should be possible to develop a correct solution using dynamic programming with memoization.
