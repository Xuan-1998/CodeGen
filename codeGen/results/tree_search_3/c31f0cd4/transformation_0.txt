===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

DP states: Consider using a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the sums that can be generated using the first i elements with a sum of j. This will allow us to keep track of the unique sums that can be generated by including or excluding each element in the set.

Consider using a recursive approach to build the dynamic programming solution, where each state represents the subsets of the given set that can be generated up to a certain sum. For example, we could recursively generate all subsets of the first i elements and then add them together to get the sums.

Using memoization to store previously computed sums to avoid redundant calculations and optimize the dynamic programming approach. This will prevent us from recalculating the same sums multiple times and reduce the time complexity of our solution.

Consider using a separate 1D array to keep track of the unique sums that have been generated so far, to ensure that we only output each sum once in the final result.

Edge cases: Make sure to consider what happens when the input set is empty or contains only one element. In these cases, there are no subsets and therefore no distinct sums can be generated.

Potential issues with the plan:
- The dynamic programming approach might be too slow for large inputs due to its high time complexity.
- The recursive approach could lead to stack overflow errors if the input set is very large.
- The problem statement does not guarantee that the input will only contain non-negative integers, so we should consider how our solution would handle negative integers.
