===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

Base case: Since the problem requires distinct sums, set up a base case for empty subsets (i.e., initial state). This can be represented by a single element in the dictionary with value 0. This represents the sum of an empty subset, which is 0.

Use a dictionary to store previously computed sum values as states. Initialize the dictionary with this base case.

Using dynamic programming with bottom-up approach:
1. Iterate through the given set of integers.
2. For each integer in the set, update the dictionary with new sum values that can be generated by adding the current integer to all existing sums stored in the dictionary.
3. Keep track of distinct sums and their corresponding frequencies.
4. After iterating through all integers, extract the unique sums from the dictionary.

This approach ensures that we only compute each sum value once, which reduces the time complexity.
