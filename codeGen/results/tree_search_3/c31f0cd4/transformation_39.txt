===BEGIN PLAN REVISION===
A top-down approach with memoization is indeed effective for solving this problem. Your initial intuition is correct!

Some minor adjustments to refine the plan:
- Instead of using a 2D DP table, consider using a hash map (or a set) to store the distinct sums. This will help in reducing space complexity.
- The state expression could be an integer (current_sum) representing the sum of all subsets seen so far.
- Create a recursive function that generates subsets and calculates their corresponding sums. Use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
- To improve the plan, consider using a priority queue or a sorted set to store the distinct sums in increasing order.

Some potential issues with the plan:
- What if there are duplicate numbers in the input? You might need to handle this edge case by considering subsets that include these duplicates.
- What about edge cases like when N = 0 (no numbers) or when all numbers are equal?

The plan does include some edge cases, but it's always good to consider more scenarios for robustness. Overall, your initial intuition is on the right track!
