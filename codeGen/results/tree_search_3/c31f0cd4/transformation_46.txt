Your initial plan shows great intuition towards using dynamic programming to solve this problem! 

The idea of representing states as tuples (subset_sum, subset) is spot-on. This allows you to keep track of the subsets and their corresponding sums.

Using a recursive approach with memoization can indeed help avoid redundant calculations and speed up the process. 

However, I'd like to suggest a few improvements:

1. **Memoization**: When using memoization, it's crucial to ensure that you're storing and retrieving the correct information efficiently. You might need to use a data structure like a hashmap or dictionary to store the calculated sums.

2. **Base Case**: Your plan mentions the empty set with a sum of 0 as the base case. That's correct! However, you should also consider handling edge cases where the input set contains only one element (in which case there is no need for memoization).

3. **Handling Duplicate Subsets**: Since you're generating subsets, you might end up with duplicate subsets due to ordering. To avoid this, consider using a consistent order for your subsets and then sorting them before calculating sums.

4. **Efficient Calculation of Sums**: When calculating the sum of each subset, think about how you can optimize this process. For example, you could iterate through the elements in the subset once and calculate the sum on-the-fly.

5. **Output**: Remember to sort your output list in ascending order before returning it.

Overall, I'd say your plan is a great starting point! With these suggestions, you should be able to create an efficient solution for this problem.
