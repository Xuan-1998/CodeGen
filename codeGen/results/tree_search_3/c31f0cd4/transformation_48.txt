Your initial plan looks good, but I'd like to add some suggestions for improvement:
The bottom-up approach with tabulation might not be the best choice for this problem as it would require initializing a 2D array to store the intermediate results and calculating the cumulative sums, which could lead to unnecessary complexity. 
This is a correct observation. The top-down approach using dynamic programming (DP) with memoization is more suitable for this problem.

To define the state as a subset of integers and its corresponding sum, and the base case as the empty set with a sum of 0.
This is a good starting point! By defining the state and the base case, you're setting up the foundation for your recursive approach.

Formulate the transition relationship by considering all possible subsets that can be formed by adding or removing an element from the current subset, and calculate the corresponding sums. The transition relation can be represented as a function that takes the current state and returns a list of new states.
This is correct! By considering all possible subsets and calculating their sums, you're essentially generating all the combinations of sums that can be formed by adding or removing elements from the initial set.

Develop a recursive approach with memorization, where each subset sum is calculated only once, and the results are stored in a cache for later reuse.
This is also correct! By using memoization, you ensure that each subset sum is calculated only once, which greatly reduces the time complexity of your algorithm.

As for potential issues with the plan:

* Edge cases: You might want to consider edge cases such as an empty set or a set containing only one element. How would these cases affect your recursive approach?
* Memoization: Make sure you implement memoization correctly to avoid redundant calculations.
* Time complexity: Since the problem statement mentions O(n * sum) time complexity, ensure that your algorithm meets this constraint.

Overall, your plan looks solid! Just make sure to address these potential issues and refine your approach as needed. Good luck with your implementation!
