Your initial intuition about using dynamic programming to solve this problem is correct. The idea of defining the state as the cumulative sum of all possible subsets and their corresponding sums is a good approach.

However, I think there might be some confusion regarding the base case and recurrence relation. You mentioned considering all previous subsets and their corresponding sums, which suggests that you're thinking about solving this problem recursively. While dynamic programming can be used to solve recursive problems, it's not necessarily the best approach for this specific problem.

A more straightforward approach would be to use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with memoization. This involves initializing a dictionary or array to store the cumulative sums of all possible subsets and then updating the values in this dictionary/array based on the previous values.

Here's an updated version of your plan:
