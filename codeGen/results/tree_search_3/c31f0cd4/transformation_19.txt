===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

State expression: Define dp[i][j] as the maximum value of sums that can be obtained by adding ai to any existing subset and its complement

Consider using a 2D array dp[i][sum] where i represents the current integer and sum is the cumulative sum, then use transitions to update the states

Maintain two arrays: one for sums that include the current integer and one for sums that do not include the current integer.
