===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

DP states: Consider using a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the sums that can be generated using the first i elements with a sum of j.

Think about how you can use bit manipulation to represent the subsets and their corresponding sums, which would allow for efficient transitions between states.

Use a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the sums that can be generated using the first i elements with a sum of j.
