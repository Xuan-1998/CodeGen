===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

Base case: Since the problem requires distinct sums, set up a base case for empty subsets (i.e., initial state). This is because an empty subset would have a sum of 0. Initialize the memoization table with the base case.

Use a set to store unique sums found so far, and iterate over all possible subsets to compute new sums. Start by initializing the set with the sum of the first element in the array (since we're considering subsets that start from the beginning).

To generate new sums, use recursion to explore all possible subsets. For each subset, calculate its sum and add it to the set if it's not already present.

Consider using a recursive function that takes two parameters: the current index and the current sum. The base case would be when the current index is greater than or equal to the size of the array (i.e., we've reached the end of the subsets), at which point return the current sum.

In each recursive step, consider including the current element in the subset (if the current index is less than the size of the array) and recursively call the function with the updated sum and the next index. Also, include a case for not including the current element in the subset, by recursively calling the function with the same sum and the next index.

To avoid duplicate sums, use the set to keep track of unique sums found so far.
