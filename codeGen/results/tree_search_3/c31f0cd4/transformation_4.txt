===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

DP states: Consider using a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the sums that can be generated using the first i elements with a sum of j. This is correct, as we're looking for the sums that can be formed by taking subsets of the input set.

Think about how you can use bit manipulation to represent the subsets and their corresponding sums, which would allow for efficient transitions between states. This is also correct, as we can use bits to represent the presence or absence of each element in the subset. We can iterate over all possible subsets by iterating over the elements and using bitwise operations (AND and OR) to generate new subsets.

However, there's a potential issue with this plan: it doesn't take into account the fact that some sums might be generated multiple times due to identical subsets being represented as different due to their order. To fix this, we can sort the elements in descending order before generating the subsets, and then only add the sum to our result set if it's not already present.

To improve the plan, we could also consider using a more efficient data structure instead of a 2D array for storing the dp states. For example, we could use a map or an unordered_map to store the sums as keys and their corresponding counts as values. This would allow us to quickly look up whether a sum has already been generated or not.

Finally, let's consider some edge cases: What if the input set is empty? In this case, we should return an empty string or an empty list of sums. What if all elements in the input set have the same value? In this case, we should return a single sum equal to the value of the elements.
