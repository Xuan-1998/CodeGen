===BEGIN PLAN===
A top-down approach with memoization could be effective in solving this problem by recursively generating subsets and their corresponding sums, then storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.
The state expression could be a tuple (subset_sum, subset_index) where subset_sum is the sum of elements in the current subset and subset_index is the index of the last element added to the subset.
Think about using a recursive approach with memoization, where the state is the current subset and its corresponding sum, and the transition relationship is defined by recursively generating all possible subsets from the remaining elements.
Create a memoization dictionary to store the sums of subsets as you generate them, where the key is the subset_sum and the value is the corresponding subset.

Your plan seems correct! Using memoization can indeed help avoid redundant calculations. The state expression you proposed also looks good, as it captures the relevant information needed for the problem.
However, I would suggest adding a base case to your recursive approach. This could be when the current subset_sum equals 0 (i.e., the sum of an empty set), in which case you can simply store this state in your memoization dictionary.

Additionally, you might want to consider handling edge cases such as what happens when the input set is empty or contains only one element? In these cases, the problem statement doesn't specify what the output should be, but it's important to handle them correctly.
Overall, your plan looks good and with some minor modifications, it can be a solid foundation for solving this problem.
