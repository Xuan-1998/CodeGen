Your plan looks good, but I'd like to add some more details and edge cases.

The top-down approach with memoization can be effective in solving this problem. Here's a more detailed version of your plan:

A) Define the state expression: The state expression could be a tuple (subset_elements, subset_sum), where subset_elements are the unique elements in the current subset, and subset_sum is the sum of those elements.

B) Define the recursive function: Write a recursive function that generates subsets and their corresponding sums. The function should take the set of integers and an integer representing the index to start from as input. It should return a dictionary where the keys are tuples (subset_elements, subset_sum) and the values are lists of distinct sums.

C) Implement memoization: Use a dictionary to store intermediate results. When calculating a sum, check if it's already in the dictionary. If it is, don't calculate it again; instead, retrieve the value from the dictionary.

D) Handle edge cases: Think about what happens when the input set is empty or contains only one element. How will you handle these edge cases?

E) Improve performance: To improve performance, consider using a more efficient data structure than a list for storing subsets and their sums. A bitset or a binary vector could be used to represent subsets.

F) Handle duplicate sums: Since the problem requires distinct sums in increasing order, make sure to remove duplicates from the list of sums.

G) Return the result: Finally, return the list of distinct sums in increasing order.
