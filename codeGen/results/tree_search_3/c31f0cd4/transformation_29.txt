===BEGIN PLAN===
A top-down approach with memoization could be effective in solving this problem by recursively generating subsets and their corresponding sums, then storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.

The state expression could be a tuple (subset_sum, subset_index) where subset_sum is the sum of elements in the current subset and subset_index is the index of the last element added to the subset.
Consider using a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming, where the state represents the cumulative sum of elements up to a given position and the transition relationship is defined by the possible subsets that can be formed by adding an element at each step.

Storing intermediate results in a table and using this table to look up previously computed values instead of recomputing them.
