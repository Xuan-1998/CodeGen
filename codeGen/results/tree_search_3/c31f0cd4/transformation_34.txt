===BEGIN PLAN===
A top-down approach with memoization could be effective in solving this problem by recursively generating subsets and their corresponding sums, then storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.

The state expression could be a tuple (subset_sum, subset_index) where subset_sum is the sum of elements in the current subset and subset_index is the index of the last element added to the subset.
This approach looks good! Using a tuple as the state expression allows us to keep track of both the current sum and the index of the last element added to the subset. This will be useful when generating subsets.

A hash-based approach could be effective in solving this problem, where the state represents the current cumulative sum and the transition relationship is defined by storing the sums of all possible subsets that can be formed from the given set.
This approach also looks good! Using a hash-based approach allows us to store the sums of all possible subsets efficiently. We can use this hash table to look up the sums of subsets without having to generate them again.

Memoization: Create a memo dictionary to store the results of subproblems and look up their values as needed during the recursive function calls.
This is also a good idea! Memoization allows us to avoid redundant calculations by storing the results of subproblems and looking them up when we need them. This will greatly improve the efficiency of our solution.
