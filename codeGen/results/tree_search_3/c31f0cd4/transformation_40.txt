===BEGIN PLAN===
A top-down approach with memoization could be effective in solving this problem by recursively generating subsets and their corresponding sums, then storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.

The state expression could be an integer (current_sum) representing the sum of all subsets seen so far. 

Using a 2D DP table with rows for each subset size and columns for each number in the set, where dp[i][j] represents the sum of all subsets containing j as the maximum value.
This approach seems to capture the essence of the problem.

However, there are some issues that need to be addressed:

* How do we initialize the DP table? 
* What is the base case for the recursion?
* How do we update the DP table based on the current_sum and previous results?

To improve this plan, consider breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and recursively solving them. 

One potential issue with the plan is that it does not handle edge cases. For example, what if the input set contains duplicate numbers? Or what if one of the integers in the set is zero?
To address these issues, we need to add checks for these edge cases.

In terms of edge cases, consider handling scenarios where:
* The input set is empty.
* The input set contains a single element.
* The input set contains multiple elements.

By addressing these potential issues and edge cases, we can make the plan more comprehensive and robust.
