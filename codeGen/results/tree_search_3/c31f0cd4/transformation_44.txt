Here's my analysis and feedback on your plan:

===BEGIN FEEDBACK===
The intuition that this problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming is correct!

Your plan to define the state as a combination of a subset of integers and its corresponding sum, and the base case as the empty set with a sum of 0, is also correct. This approach allows you to recursively generate all possible subsets and their corresponding sums.

The suggestion to use a dictionary to store intermediate results and calculate distinct sums from the subsets is a good idea. However, there's a potential issue that needs to be addressed: how will you ensure that the same subset-sum combination is not counted multiple times?

One way to address this is by maintaining a set of unique subset-sum combinations as you generate them. This can be done by iterating through the dictionary keys (subset_sum values) and only adding new, unseen subset-sum combinations to the result.

Another potential issue is handling edge cases. What if the input set contains duplicate elements? Should they be treated as separate subsets or combined into a single subset?

To improve your plan, consider the following:

1. Clarify how you will handle edge cases, such as duplicate elements.
2. Add more detail on how you will use the dictionary to store intermediate results and calculate distinct sums from the subsets.
3. Consider using a more efficient data structure than a dictionary to store subset-sum combinations (e.g., a set or a list of tuples).

Overall, your plan is a good starting point, but it needs some refinement to handle edge cases and optimize performance.
