===BEGIN PLAN===
A top-down approach with memoization could be effective in solving this problem by recursively generating subsets and their corresponding sums, then storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.

The state expression could be a set (subset_elements) where subset_elements are the unique elements in the current subset. This would allow us to store previously calculated sums and avoid recalculating them when we encounter the same subset again.

Here's how the recursive function could work:
- For each element in the input set, recursively generate all subsets that include this element.
- Calculate the sum for each subset and store it in a dictionary with the subset as the key.
- If the sum has not been calculated before (i.e., it is not already in the dictionary), calculate it and store it.

To avoid redundant calculations, we could use memoization to cache the results of previously calculated subsets. This would ensure that each subset is only calculated once, even if it appears multiple times in the recursive function's call stack.

Another option is to use tabulation by initializing an empty dictionary, then iterating over all possible subsets and their corresponding sums, storing the results in the dictionary for future lookups.

Here's how the tabulation approach could work:
- Initialize an empty dictionary to store the calculated sums.
- Iterate over each element in the input set.
- For each element, generate all subsets that include this element.
- Calculate the sum for each subset and store it in the dictionary with the subset as the key.
- If the sum has not been calculated before (i.e., it is not already in the dictionary), calculate it and store it.

Both approaches should allow us to efficiently calculate all distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets of the given set. The time complexity would be O(n * 2^n) for both approaches, where n is the number of elements in the input set.

Potential issues with the plan:
- We need to ensure that we handle edge cases correctly, such as when the input set contains duplicate elements or when an empty subset is considered.
- We should also consider how to efficiently store and retrieve subsets from the dictionary. A simple approach could be to use a string representation of the subset (e.g., "1 2 3") and use this as the dictionary key.
