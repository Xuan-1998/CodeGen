Consider using memoization for the dynamic programming approach, as this problem involves finding all distinct sums that can be generated from subsets of the given set.

State expression: Define dp[i][j] as the maximum value of sums that can be obtained by adding ai to any existing subset and its complement

Use a hashmap to store the subsets and their corresponding sums, then iterate over all possible combinations of subsets and calculate the total sum

Implementing tabulation using a nested loop structure where the outer loop iterates over all possible subsets and the inner loop calculates the total sum
