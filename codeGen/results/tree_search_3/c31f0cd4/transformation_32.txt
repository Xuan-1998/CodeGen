===BEGIN PLAN===
A top-down approach with memoization could be effective in solving this problem by recursively generating subsets and their corresponding sums, then storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.

The state expression could be a tuple (subset_sum, subset_index) where subset_sum is the sum of elements in the current subset and subset_index is the index of the last element added to the subset.

Think about using a recursive approach with memoization, where the state is the current subset and its corresponding sum, and the transition relationship is defined by recursively generating all possible subsets from the remaining elements.

Implement a recursive function that takes the current subset and its sum as input, and returns a set of distinct sums that can be generated from the subsets, while storing previously calculated results using memoization.

Here's an improved plan:

1. Initialize an empty hashmap (memo) to store the results.
2. Define a recursive function dp(subset_sum, subset_index) that takes the current subset sum and index as input.
3. Base case: If subset_sum is out of bounds or if the set of subsets is empty, return an empty list.
4. Recursive case:
    - For each element ai in the remaining elements (i.e., the elements after the last one added to the subset):
        - Add ai to the current subset and calculate its sum with respect to the previous subset sum.
        - Store the result in memo as a tuple (new_subset_sum, subset_index + 1).
    - Return the union of the results from the recursive calls and the base case.

This plan addresses edge cases by handling out-of-bounds sums and empty subsets.

Potential issues:

- The plan does not consider duplicate elements. To handle this, add a check to ensure that each element is only added once to the subset.
- The plan may still experience redundant calculations if there are repeated sums. To mitigate this, store the results in memo as sets of unique sums instead of lists.
- The plan assumes that the input integers do not exceed 100. If the input can be larger, consider using a more efficient data structure or algorithm.
