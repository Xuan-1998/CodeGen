===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array dp[i] that stores the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

Let's break down the plan step by step:

1. Initialize dp[i] for each vertex i in the graph.
2. Define the transition function dp[state] = ...:
    * If i is in the fixed path, the minimum number of recomputations needed from i to t is 0 (since we follow the recommended path).
    * Otherwise, we need to compute the shortest path from i to t by considering all possible recomputations. Let's denote the previous vertex in the fixed path as v. The transition function would be:
        + If j is less than or equal to the distance from i to v (i.e., we haven't exceeded the maximum number of recomputations allowed), then dp[state] = 1 + max(dp[v][0]) (since we need to recompute the shortest path from v to t).
        + Otherwise, dp[state] = min(dp[v][max(j-v+1, 0)] + 1 for v in vertices) (since we can't exceed the maximum number of recomputations allowed).

3. Use memoization with a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computation.

4. Finally, compute dp[t] which represents the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path from the current vertex to t needs to be recomputed.

The plan seems correct in terms of capturing the optimal substructure and using dynamic programming to solve the problem.

However, there are a few potential issues:

* The transition function may not handle edge cases correctly. For example, what if i is not in the fixed path but j is 0? Should we consider recomputing the shortest path from i to t or just follow the recommended path?
* The plan doesn't explicitly mention how to initialize dp[i] for each vertex i. We need to make sure that the initial values are correct.
* The plan assumes that the graph is strongly connected, which may not be the case.

To improve the plan:

* Add more detail on how to handle edge cases and corner cases.
* Provide a clear explanation of how to initialize dp[i] for each vertex i.
* Consider adding more constraints or assumptions about the input graph (e.g., it's strongly connected) to make the problem easier to solve.
