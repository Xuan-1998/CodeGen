===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array dp[i] that stores the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

To clarify, let's break down the problem into smaller subproblems:

1. For each vertex i, find the minimum number of recomputations needed to reach vertex t from i.
2. The minimum number of recomputations is the minimum number of times you need to recompute the shortest path from i to t.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with memoization.

Let's define dp[i] as the minimum number of recomputations needed to reach vertex t from vertex i.

The base case is when i = t, in which case dp[i] = 0 (no need to recompute).

For other vertices i, we consider two options:

1. Follow the recommended path: In this case, we don't need to recompute.
2. Don't follow the recommended path: In this case, we need to recompute.

So, dp[i] = min(1 + dp[j] for j in vertices if is_reachable(i, j) and j not in recommended_path)

Here's where memoization comes in:

* We store the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t in a dictionary as we compute them.
* Before computing dp[i], we check if it's already stored in the dictionary. If so, return the stored value.

This way, we avoid redundant computations and only compute each subproblem once.

The time complexity is O(n + m), where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges.

The space complexity is O(n), as we need to store dp[i] for all vertices i.
