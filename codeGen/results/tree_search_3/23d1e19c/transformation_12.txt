===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array dp[i] that stores the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

The plan should start by initializing the dynamic programming table dp with a size of n+1 (where n is the number of vertices). For each vertex i in the graph, calculate dp[i] as follows:

* If vertex i is in the fixed path, then dp[i] = 0, since you don't need to recomputed the shortest path.
* If vertex i is not in the fixed path, then dp[i] is equal to the minimum number of recomputations needed from any vertex j that comes before i in the recommended path, plus 1. This is because when you reach vertex i, you have two options: follow the recommended path or not.

The transition function for dp[i] can be written as:

dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1 for j in range(1, i)) if i not in fixed_path, else 0;

This way, you are considering all possible recomputations that could happen when reaching vertex i from any previous vertex.

Create a table dp such that dp[i] represents the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t.
