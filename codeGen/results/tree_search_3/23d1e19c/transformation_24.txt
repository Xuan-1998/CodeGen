===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array f[i] that stores the maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

f[i] = min(1 + f[v] for v in range(i+1, t+1)) if i != t, f[0], f[t]

The state could be the current vertex i and the previous vertex j, and the transition relationship would be to update f[i] based on whether we follow the recommended path or not.

Use a dynamic programming table to store the maximum number of recomputations needed from each vertex to t.
