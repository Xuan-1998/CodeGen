===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array dp[i] that stores the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

The initial observation is that for a given vertex i, we can only consider vertices v in next_vertices(i) as potential next steps, since these are the only vertices that can be reached from i. Similarly, if we don't follow the recommended path at vertex i, we need to recompute the shortest paths from all vertices that were previously reachable through i.

Let's analyze the transition function dp[i] = min(dp[v] + 1 for v in next_vertices(i)) if not follow_recommendation(i) else dp[next_vertex(i)]. This looks correct - if we don't follow the recommended path, we need to recompute the shortest paths from all vertices that were previously reachable through i, and add one to the total count. If we do follow the recommended path, we just need to consider the recomputations needed for the next vertex in the path.

To improve this plan, we can use a dictionary to memoize the dp[i] values for each vertex i, so that we can quickly look up the value without having to recompute it. This should significantly reduce the time complexity of our solution.

One potential issue with this plan is that we might not consider all possible paths correctly - if there are multiple shortest paths from a given vertex to t, and we only follow one of them, we might miss some recomputations. However, since the problem statement guarantees that all vertices in the fixed path are distinct and there exists a directed edge between consecutive vertices in the path, this shouldn't be an issue.

In terms of edge cases, it's worth noting that we should handle the case where i = t separately - if we reach vertex t, we don't need to recompute any more. We can add a special base case for dp[t] = 0 to account for this.

Overall, this plan looks like a good starting point for solving the problem!
