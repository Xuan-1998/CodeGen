===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array dp[i] that stores the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

dp[i] represents the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t.
If you don't follow the recommended path, you need to recompute the shortest path from the current vertex to t. This is done by considering all vertices v in next_vertices(i) and taking the minimum dp[v] + 1.
On the other hand, if you follow the recommended path, then you just need to continue with the recomputation process from the next vertex.

So, the recurrence relation can be written as:
dp[i] = min(dp[v] + 1 for v in next_vertices(i)) if not follow_recommendation(i) else dp[next_vertex(i)]

Use a 2D DP table to store the minimum and maximum number of recomputations needed from each vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t.
