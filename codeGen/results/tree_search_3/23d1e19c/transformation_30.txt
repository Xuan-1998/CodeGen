===BEGIN PLAN===
To improve this plan, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initialize an array dp[] to store the maximum number of recomputations needed from each vertex i to t.

dp[i] = 0 for all vertices except t (since we're only interested in the shortest path to t)

2. Iterate through each edge (u, v) in the graph.
   - For each edge, check if it's part of the fixed path from s to t. If it is, update dp[v] with the maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex u to t.

3. Use dynamic programming to compute dp[i] for all vertices i in the following way:
    * If i is not equal to t, consider two cases: 
       - Follow the recommended path (i.e., take the edge leading to vertex j if there's one) and update dp[i] with the maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex j to t.
       - Don't follow the recommended path and update dp[i] with the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex j to t, where j ranges from i+1 to t.

    * If i is equal to t, set dp[i] = 0 since we've already reached our destination.

4. Return the maximum and minimum values in dp[] as the answer.

This plan addresses the problem by maintaining a dynamic programming array that keeps track of the maximum number of recomputations needed from each vertex to t. It then iterates through each edge, updating dp[v] for vertices part of the fixed path, before computing dp[i] for all vertices using dynamic programming.

The plan includes edge cases: initializing dp[] with 0 for all vertices except t, and setting dp[t] = 0 since we've reached our destination.

No potential issues have been identified in this plan.
