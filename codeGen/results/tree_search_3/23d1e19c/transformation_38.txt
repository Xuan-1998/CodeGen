===BEGIN FEEDBACK===
Your plan looks good, but there are a few minor issues that can be addressed:

The first issue is with the transition relationship for dp[i]. You're only considering vertices j in the fixed path p[k+1..t], which may not be sufficient. You should consider all vertices reachable from i, including those outside the fixed path.

Another issue is that you haven't specified how to initialize f[0] and f[t]. You need to decide what these values are based on the problem constraints.

You're correct in considering a dynamic programming approach, but you may want to use a different name for your array. dp[i] could be confusing since it's not actually storing the shortest path distances. A more descriptive name like "max_recomputations" would be clearer.

Finally, you haven't specified how to handle edge cases, such as when there are no edges in the graph or when the fixed path is empty. You should think about these special cases and decide what values f[0] and f[t] should take.

Here's an updated version of your plan with these issues addressed:

===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
Let's use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We'll maintain two arrays, "max_recomputations[i]" that stores the maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t.

To initialize "max_recomputations[i]", we consider all vertices j reachable from i (including those outside the fixed path). If there's an edge from j to i, then we update "max_recomputations[i]" as follows:

"max_recomputations[i] = min("max_recomputations[j] + 1 for j in range(i+1, n+1) if has_edge(j, i))"

If i is the last vertex in the fixed path (i.e., p[k]), then we set "max_recomputations[p[k]]" to f[t], which represents the minimum number of recomputations needed from the end of the fixed path to t.

Finally, we fill up "max_recomputations[i]" iteratively using tabulation, where "max_recomputations[i] is updated based on the minimum number of recomputations needed from all vertices in the fixed path that are reachable from i.

We should also handle edge cases carefully. For example, if there are no edges in the graph or if the fixed path is empty, then we need to decide what values "max_recomputations[0]" and "max_recomputations[t]" should take.
