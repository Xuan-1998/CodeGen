===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array dp[i] that stores the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

dp[i] represents the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t.
dp[i] = min(1 + dp[j] for j in vertices if is_reachable(i, j) and j not in recommended_path)

Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach, initializing dp[i] as infinity and updating it recursively based on the recommended path.
