Your plan looks good, but there are a few potential issues to consider.

Firstly, your dynamic programming approach seems correct. You're trying to maintain an array that keeps track of both the minimum and maximum number of recomputations needed from each vertex to t, considering all shortest paths from that vertex to t.

However, when you transition from one vertex to another, you should also take into account whether the recommended path is followed or not. This might affect the values in your dp array.

The relationship you've formulated seems correct: if i is on the recommended path, then dp[i][0] = min(dp[j][0] for j from s to t), and dp[i][1] = max(dp[j][1] for j from s to t); otherwise, it remains unchanged. This takes into account whether you're following the recommended path or not.

Another potential issue is that your plan doesn't seem to handle edge cases correctly. For example, what if there are no recomputations needed at all? Or what if the shortest path to t needs to be recomputed infinitely many times?

Finally, I think you should consider adding more detail to your state and transition relationships. For example, how do you decide whether to follow the recommended path or not? Is it based on some threshold value, or is it based on something else entirely?

Overall, your plan seems like a good starting point, but there are definitely some potential issues to consider.
