===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array dp[i] that stores the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

The plan is correct in identifying the problem as a dynamic programming problem. However, there are some potential issues with the plan that need to be addressed:

1. The base case of dp[i] = 0 for t is missing. This is necessary because if i == t, you don't need to recompute the shortest path.

2. The recursive formula dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1 for j in all_vertices if is_reachable(i, j)) seems correct but needs to be revised. The correct formula should consider both the case when you follow the recommended path and the case when you don't follow it.

3. There's no mention of initializing the dp array with a value for all vertices before starting the dynamic programming process. This step is crucial for dynamic programming problems.

Here's an updated version of the plan that addresses these issues:
