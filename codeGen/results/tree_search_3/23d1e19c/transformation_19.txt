===BEGIN FEEDBACK===
Your plan looks good, but I have a few suggestions to improve it:

* You mentioned that dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t, after j recomputations. However, you didn't specify what dp[i][0] should be if i is not in the fixed path.
* You also need to consider the case when i is in the fixed path but has already been recomputed once or more times. In this case, you can just copy the result from the previous vertex v.
* It's also important to note that your plan assumes that all vertices are reachable from s to t. If there are unreachable vertices, you need to handle them separately.

Here is an updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach where you maintain a 2D array dp[i][j] that stores the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t, after j recomputations.
Let dp[i][0] be the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, if i is in the fixed path. If i is not in the fixed path, then dp[i][0] = 1 + max(dp[v][0]) where v is the previous vertex in the path.
For j > 0, consider two cases:
    Case 1: i is in the fixed path and has already been recomputed once or more times. In this case, dp[i][j] = dp[v][j-1], where v is the previous vertex in the path.
    Case 2: i is not in the fixed path. In this case, dp[i][j] = 1 + max(dp[v][0]), where v is the previous vertex in the path.

The final answer will be dp[t][max_j], where t is the last vertex in the fixed path and max_j is the maximum number of recomputations needed.
===END UPDATED PLAN===
