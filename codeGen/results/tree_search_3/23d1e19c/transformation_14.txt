===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array dp[i] that stores the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

dp[i] is 0 if vertex i is in the fixed path, and 1 + dp[v] otherwise (where v is the previous vertex in the path),

State: dp[i] is updated based on whether the current vertex i follows the recommended path or not,

Memoization using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems.
