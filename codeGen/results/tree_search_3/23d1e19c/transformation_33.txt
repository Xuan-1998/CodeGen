===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about a dynamic programming approach where you maintain two arrays dp[i] and min_dp[i] that store the maximum and minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t.
dp[i] = max(dp[j] for j in range(i+1, t+1) if has_edge(j, i)) if i != t, 0, float('inf')
min_dp[i] = min(min_dp[j] + (t-j+1) for j in range(i+1, t+1) if has_edge(j, i)) if i != t, 0, float('inf')

Create a bottom-up dynamic programming table by initializing dp[0] and min_dp[0] based on the given path from s to t.
dp[0] = k - 1
min_dp[0] = k - 1

Fill in the dynamic programming table by iterating over the vertices from s to t, using the previous values of dp[i] and min_dp[i] to compute the new values.

Finally, iterate over the fixed path from s to t and use the values in the dynamic programming table to compute the minimum and maximum number of recomputations needed.
