===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array dp[i] that stores the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

Initially, it seems like a good approach. However, there's an issue with the plan: it doesn't take into account that recomputations can occur at any point along the fixed path, not just at the end of the path.

To improve this plan, we need to consider these intermediate recomputations. One way to do this is by maintaining a separate array for each vertex in the fixed path, storing the minimum number of recomputations needed from that vertex to t. Then, for each vertex i on the path, calculate dp[i] as the minimum of the following cases:

* If i is at the end of the fixed path (i.e., i = t), then dp[i] = 1 if the recommended path is not followed.
* Otherwise, consider all shortest paths from i to t. For each vertex v on this path, calculate dp[v] as the minimum number of recomputations needed from v to t. Then, dp[i] is the minimum of the following:
	+ Follow the recommended path: dp[i] = 0
	+ Don't follow the recommended path and recalculate the shortest path: dp[i] = 1 + max(dp[v])

This modified plan should correctly calculate the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path from the current vertex to t needs to be recomputed.

Potential issues with the original plan include:
* It doesn't account for intermediate recomputations along the fixed path.
* The base case is when i = t, but this doesn't capture the fact that recomputations can occur at any point along the fixed path.

The modified plan addresses these issues by maintaining separate arrays for each vertex in the fixed path and considering all shortest paths from each vertex to t.

Edge cases:
* What if the fixed path has only one vertex? In this case, dp[i] should be 0.
* What if there are no recomputations needed along the fixed path?
