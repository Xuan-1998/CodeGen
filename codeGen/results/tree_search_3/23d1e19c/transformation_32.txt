===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array f[i] that stores the maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

dp[i] = max(dp[j] for j in range(i, t+1) if has_edge(j, i)) if i != t, 0, float('inf') 
This line seems correct. It's trying to find the maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t by considering all shortest paths from i to t.

dp[i] = sum(1 for _ in range(min(dp[j]) for j in range(i, t) if has_edge(j, i))) if i != t, 0, float('inf') 
This line seems incorrect. It's trying to find the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t by considering all shortest paths from i to t. However, this line doesn't make sense in the context of dynamic programming.

dp[i] = sum(1 for _ in range(min(dp[j]) for j in range(i, t) if has_edge(j, i))) if i != t, 0, float('inf') 
This line seems identical to the previous incorrect line. It's not clear what this line is trying to do.
