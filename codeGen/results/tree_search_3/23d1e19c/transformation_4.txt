===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array dp[i] that stores the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

The plan starts by initializing a 2D array dp[][] with size n x (k+1) where k is the number of vertices in the fixed path from s to t. Each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to the jth vertex in the fixed path.

The recurrence relation for calculating dp[i][j] can be written as:

dp[i][j] = min(1 + dp[j-1][j] for j in range(k+1) if is_reachable(i, j) and j not in recommended_path)

This calculates the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to reach the jth vertex in the fixed path, considering all shortest paths from i to t.

To find the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path needs to be recomputed, you need to iterate over each cell dp[i][j] for all 0 <= i < n and 1 <= j <= k. For each cell, calculate the minimum (min) and maximum (max) values in that cell.

The plan ends by returning the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path needs to be recomputed as min_val and max_val respectively:

min_val = min(dp[i][j] for i range(n), j range(k+1))
max_val = max(dp[i][j] for i range(n), j range(k+1))
