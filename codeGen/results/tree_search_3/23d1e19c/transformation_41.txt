===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array f[i] that stores the maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.
f[0] = 1 (since we are at the start of the path) 
f[i] = min(f[j] + 1 for j in range(i, t+1) if has_edge(j, i)) if i != t
f[t] = 0 (since we have reached the end of the path)

The key observation here is that when we are at vertex i and considering recomputing the shortest path to t, we need to consider all possible predecessors of i in the fixed path. We can maintain an array dp[i] that stores the maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t.
dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1 for j in range(p[k-1]+1, i+1) if has_edge(j, i)) where k is the index of vertex i in the fixed path.

Explore using a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization to compute the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path needs to be recomputed.
Compute min dp[i] (the minimum number of times the shortest path needs to be recomputed) and max dp[i] (the maximum number of times the shortest path needs to be recomputed)
Compute min_recompute = min(dp[1] + ... + dp[t]) and max_recompute = max(dp[1] + ... + dp[t])
Return min_recompute as the minimum number of times the shortest path needs to be recomputed, and max_recompute as the maximum number of times the shortest path needs to be recomputed
