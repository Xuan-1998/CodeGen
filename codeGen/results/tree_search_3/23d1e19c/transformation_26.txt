===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array f[i] that stores the maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

To clarify, let's break down the problem: given a directed graph with n vertices and m edges, and a fixed path from s to t, determine the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path from the current vertex to t needs to be recomputed. At each vertex, the system shows the shortest path from the current vertex to t. If the driver chooses to follow the recommended path, the system maintains the path. Otherwise, the system recomputes the shortest path from the current vertex to t.

Let's define a state variable s and p, where s is the current vertex and p is the previous vertex. The transition relationship would be to update f[i] based on whether we follow the recommended path or not.

f[i] = min(1 + f[v] for v in range(i+1, t+1)) if i != t, 0 if i == t

The state could be the current vertex i and the previous vertex j, and the transition relationship would be to update f[i] based on whether we follow the recommended path or not.

Implement a bottom-up tabulation approach where you start with f[0] = 0, and then iterate over all vertices from s to t. For each vertex i, compute the minimum number of recomputations needed by considering all shortest paths from i to t.

f[i] = min(1 + f[v] for v in range(i+1, t+1)) if i != t, 0 if i == t

The plan is correct, but it can be improved by taking into account the edge cases. The main issue with this plan is that it does not consider the fact that if we are at vertex i and the shortest path from i to t recommends moving to vertex v, then we need to consider all shortest paths from v to t.

To handle this, we can add a loop to iterate over all vertices from v to t and update f[i] based on whether we follow the recommended path or not.

This plan does include edge cases. It handles the case where i == t by setting f[i] = 0. It also handles the case where i != t by considering all shortest paths from i to t and updating f[i] accordingly.
