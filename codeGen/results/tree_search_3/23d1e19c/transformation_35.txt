===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array f[i] that stores the maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

dp[i] = max(dp[j] for j in range(i, t+1) if has_edge(j, i)) if i != t, 0, float('inf')
dp[i] = dp[t-1] + (t-i+1) if i != t, 0, float('inf')

Initialize an array f where f[i] stores the maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, then use bottom-up dynamic programming to fill in the table.
