===BEGIN FEEDBACK PLAN===
Let's analyze the plan step by step:

1. The dynamic programming approach is a good start, as it allows us to break down the problem into smaller subproblems.

2. Maintaining an array f[i] that stores the maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t is a correct idea. This can be done using a top-down or bottom-up approach.

3. The transition relationship for the dynamic programming equation, f[i] = min(f[j] + 1 for j in range(i, t+1) if has_edge(j, i)) if i != t, f[0], f[t], seems correct.

4. Maintaining an array dp[i] that stores the maximum number of recomputations needed to reach vertex t from vertex i is also a good idea. The transition relationship dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1 for j in range(i, p[k]+1) if has_edge(j, i)) seems correct.

5. Using memoization by storing the computed values for each vertex as you visit it is a good way to avoid recomputing the same value multiple times.

6. The plan does not explicitly handle edge cases, but this can be done by adding checks for invalid inputs or handling special cases (e.g., what if there are no edges in the graph?).

7. However, there might be potential issues with the plan:

- It's unclear how to initialize the arrays f[i] and dp[i]. Do we start from scratch or use some precomputed values?

- The plan does not explicitly mention handling the case when vertex i is reached but it has already been computed before (e.g., if we have a cycle in the graph).

- There might be cases where recomputation is needed more than once, but this is not explicitly handled by the plan.

To improve the plan:

- Consider using a bottom-up approach for the dynamic programming equation to avoid overflows when dealing with large values of n and m.

- Add explicit checks for edge cases and handle them accordingly.

- Clarify how to initialize the arrays f[i] and dp[i].

- Handle the case where recomputation is needed more than once.
