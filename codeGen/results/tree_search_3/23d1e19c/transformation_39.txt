===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array f[i] that stores the maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.
f[i] = min(f[j] + 1 for j in range(i, t+1) if has_edge(j, i)) if i != t, f[0], f[t]
The key observation here is that when we are at vertex i and considering recomputing the shortest path to t, we need to consider all possible predecessors of i in the fixed path. We can maintain an array dp[i] that stores the maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t. The transition relationship is: dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1 for j in range(p[k-1]+1, i+1) if has_edge(j, i)), where k is the index of vertex i in the fixed path.
Consider implementing a bottom-up dynamic programming approach using a 2D array to store the maximum number of recomputations needed from each vertex to t.
