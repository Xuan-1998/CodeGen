===BEGIN PLAN===
Try a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array minmax[i] that stores both the minimum and maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

minmax[i] = max(minmax[j] + 1 for j from s to t); ... 

Formulate state and transition relationships using the following: minmax[i][0] represents the minimum number of recomputations needed, minmax[i][1] represents the maximum number of recomputations needed, and minmax[j] is a 2-element array for vertex j. The relationship is defined as follows: if i is not on the recommended path, then minmax[i][0] = max(minmax[j][0] + 1 for j from s to t), and minmax[i][1] = min(minmax[j][1] + 1 for j from s to t); otherwise, it remains unchanged.
