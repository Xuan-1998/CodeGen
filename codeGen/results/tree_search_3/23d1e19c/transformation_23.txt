===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array f[i] that stores the maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

The state could be the current vertex i, and the transition relationship would be to compute the minimum number of recomputations needed from each vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t.

However, I think there's a mistake in your plan. The idea seems correct, but the formula for f[i] is not quite right. You're trying to find the maximum number of recomputations, but you're using a minimum (min) function instead. This could lead to incorrect results.

To fix this, you should use a max function instead:

f[i] = max(1 + f[v] for v in range(i+1, t+1)) if i != t, f[0], f[t]

This formula says that the maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t is either 1 plus the maximum number of recomputations needed from the next vertex to t (if i is not t), or just f[0] and f[t] if i is t.

Also, I think you should consider edge cases where the graph has only one vertex (n=1) or no edges at all (m=0). In these cases, the problem statement doesn't specify what to do, so you might need to add some extra code to handle these situations.

Finally, it would be a good idea to validate your solution by testing it on some small input graphs and checking if it produces the correct results. This can help catch any bugs or issues with your implementation.

Overall, I think your plan is on the right track, but you should make some changes to fix the formula for f[i] and consider edge cases. With a little more work, this could be a solid solution!
