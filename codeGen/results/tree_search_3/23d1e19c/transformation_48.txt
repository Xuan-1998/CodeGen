===BEGIN PLAN===
Try a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array minmax[i] that stores both the minimum and maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

minmax[i] = max(minmax[j] + 1 for j from s to t); ...

Formulate state and transition relationships by maintaining an array dp[i][2] where dp[i][0] is the minimum number of recomputations needed and dp[i][1] is the maximum number of recomputations needed. The relationship is defined as follows: if i is not on the recommended path, then dp[i][0] = min(dp[j][0] + 1 for j from s to t), and dp[i][1] = max(dp[j][1] + 1 for j from s to t); otherwise, it remains unchanged.

However, there are some potential issues with this plan:

* The state transition relationship is not clearly defined. What happens when i is on the recommended path?
* The dynamic programming approach seems to be focusing on recomputing the shortest path, but it's unclear how this relates to the minimum and maximum number of times the shortest path from the current vertex to t needs to be recomputed.
* There is no mention of handling the edge case where i is equal to s or t. How would you handle these cases?

To improve this plan, I would suggest the following:

* Clearly define the state transition relationship for when i is on and off the recommended path.
* Modify the dynamic programming approach to focus on counting the number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, rather than just computing the shortest path.
* Add explicit handling for the edge cases where i is equal to s or t.

Here's an updated version of your plan that addresses these issues:
