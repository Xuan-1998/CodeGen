===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array dp[i] that stores the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

The plan can be broken down into three main steps:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize an array dp[0...n-1] with a value of infinity for all vertices except those in the fixed path, where dp[i] = 0.
2. **State transition**: For each vertex i, update dp[i] based on whether the current vertex i follows the recommended path or not. If vertex i is in the fixed path, then dp[i] = 0. Otherwise, consider all shortest paths from vertex i to t and update dp[i] as follows:
    - If the recommended path is followed, then dp[i] = dp[v] (where v is the previous vertex in the fixed path), since we can simply follow the recomputed path.
    - If the recommended path is not followed, then dp[i] = 1 + min(dp[j]) over all vertices j such that there's an edge from j to i. This represents the minimum number of recomputations needed if we decide not to follow the recommended path.

3. **Tabulation**: Use a 2D array to store the results of subproblems, where dp[i][j] stores the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to vertex j. Initialize dp[i][i] = 0 for all vertices i. Then, iterate over all edges (u, v) and update dp[u][v] based on whether u follows the recommended path or not.

The plan appears correct in terms of capturing the dynamic programming approach. However, there are some potential issues to consider:

* Edge cases: What happens if the fixed path contains a vertex that has no outgoing edges? How do we handle this case?
* Optimization: Can we optimize the dynamic programming approach by only considering vertices that have not been previously updated?

Overall, the plan provides a good starting point for solving this problem using dynamic programming. With some careful consideration of edge cases and potential optimizations, it should be possible to develop an efficient solution.
