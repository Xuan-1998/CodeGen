===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array f[i] that stores the maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

dp[i] = max(dp[j] for j in range(i, t+1) if has_edge(j, i)) if i != t, 0, float('inf')
This line seems correct. It means that when you are at vertex i, and you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not, you should consider all shortest paths from vertices j (where i < j <= t) to t that have an edge to vertex i.

dp[i] = sum(1 for _ in range(min(dp[j]) for j in range(i, t) if has_edge(j, i))) if i != t, 0, float('inf')
This line seems to be trying to calculate the minimum number of recomputations needed from vertices j to t when you are at vertex i and considering recomputation. However, this line is not correct because it will not give us the maximum number of recomputations.

Maintain an array f where f[i] stores the maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t considering all shortest paths from i to t
This part seems correct. You are maintaining an array f where each element f[i] represents the maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, which is what you want to find.
