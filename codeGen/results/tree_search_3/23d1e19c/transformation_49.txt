===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
Try a dynamic programming approach where you maintain a 3D array dp[i][2] that stores both the minimum and maximum number of recomputations needed from vertex i to t, considering all shortest paths from i to t. The optimal substructure is when you reach vertex i, and then you need to decide whether to follow the recommended path or not.

dp[i][0] = min(dp[j][0] + (i == j) for j in range(s, t+1))
dp[i][1] = max(dp[j][1] + (i != j) for j in range(s, t+1))

Formulate state transition relationships using a dynamic programming approach where you maintain an array dp[i][2], where:
    dp[i][0] is the minimum number of recomputations needed and
    dp[i][1] is the maximum number of recomputations needed.

Use a 3D array with separate variables for minimum, maximum, and whether we're on the recommended path.
