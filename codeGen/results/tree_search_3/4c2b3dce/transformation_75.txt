===BEGIN FEEDBACK===
Your initial plan looks promising, but there are some potential issues to consider:
- The sliding window approach might not be necessary. Instead, you can simply iterate through the string once and check for the presence of "AB" and "BA". This would eliminate the need for a 2D DP table.
- You're correct that maintaining a set of seen characters could help in tracking the current state of the substring being checked. However, instead of using a set, you can keep track of the number of 'A's and 'B's seen so far.
- The problem statement does not explicitly specify whether the substrings "AB" and "BA" must appear consecutively or just anywhere in the string. Therefore, it's important to consider both scenarios when checking for these substrings.

Here's an updated version of your plan:

===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
1. Initialize variables to track the number of 'A's and 'B's seen so far.
2. Iterate through the string:
    - For each character:
        * If the character is 'A', increment the count of 'A's seen.
        * If the character is 'B', increment the count of 'B's seen.
    - Check if the current state matches the required pattern for "AB" (i.e., 1 'A' and 1 'B'):
        * If it does, check if there are any remaining characters in the string that could form "BA". If yes, return YES. If no, continue iterating through the string.
    - Check if the current state matches the required pattern for "BA" (i.e., 1 'B' and 1 'A'):
        * If it does, check if there are any remaining characters in the string that could form "AB". If yes, return YES. If no, continue iterating through the string.
3. If neither "AB" nor "BA" is found anywhere in the string, return NO.

This plan should correctly solve the problem while being mindful of edge cases and handling both scenarios for the substrings "AB" and "BA".
===END UPDATED PLAN===
