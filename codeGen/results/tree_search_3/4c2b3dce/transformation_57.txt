===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

Consider the current character as either being part of an 'A' or a 'B'.

You can implement memoization by creating a dictionary to store previously checked substrings.

===END PLAN===

Feedback:

* The plan is generally correct, but it's missing some crucial details. You should specify how you would use the sliding window approach and what conditions you would check for.
* Memoization might not be necessary in this problem since we're only checking for the presence of two specific substrings ('AB' and 'BA'). We can simply iterate through the string once and keep track of whether we've found both substrings or not.
