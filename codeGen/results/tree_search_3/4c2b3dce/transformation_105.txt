===BEGIN PLAN REVISION===

Firstly, let's analyze the given plan:

* The initial intuition about Dynamic Programming is correct. We need to keep track of the sequence of 'A's and 'B's to determine if there are two non-overlapping substrings "AB" and "BA".
* Defining a state as {bool[previous character is 'A'], bool[previous character is 'B']} is a good start, but it might be more efficient to use a simpler state representation.
* The base case of the recursion is correct: when the string has only one or two characters, we can directly determine if there are the required substrings.

Now, let's revise the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN REVISION===
1. Define states as tuples (prev_state, curr_char) where:
    * prev_state is either "A", "B", or neither ('_' or None).
    * curr_char is either 'A' or 'B'.
2. Initialize a set of visited states and an empty set for the current state.
3. Create a base case: if the length of the string is 1 or 2, check if it contains both "AB" and "BA".
4. Define a recursive function that takes in the current string index and updates the current state based on the current character.
5. In each recursive step:
    * If the current state has already been visited, return the result from the previous visit (memoization).
    * Otherwise, update the set of visited states with the current state.
6. For each possible next state (prev_state + curr_char), check if it contains both "AB" and "BA".
7. If a solution is found, print "YES", otherwise print "NO".
