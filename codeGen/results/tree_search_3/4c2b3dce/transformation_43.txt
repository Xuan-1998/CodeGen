===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

**Potential Issue:** The problem statement does not specify that the substrings "AB" and "BA" should be non-overlapping. This could lead to incorrect results if the approach is modified to consider overlapping occurrences.

States can be transitions from a previous state, with transitions being YES if the current substring is either AB or BA, and NO otherwise.

**Improvement:** Consider using a boolean array to keep track of whether "AB" or "BA" has been found at each position in the string. This would allow for efficient checking of whether one of these substrings appears in the remaining part of the string.

Implement memoization to avoid redundant calculations

**Correctness:** The plan is correct in that it uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. However, it may not be the most efficient solution due to the potential need to check for overlap.
