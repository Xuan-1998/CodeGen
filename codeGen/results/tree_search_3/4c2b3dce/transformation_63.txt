The sliding window approach can be useful, but it might not be the best choice here. You're right that you need to track whether the string seen so far can be rearranged into both substrings.

A better approach would be to use a boolean array to track the presence of each character in the string, then iterate through the string and check if 'AB' or 'BA' is present at any position. This could be done by checking if the characters 'A', 'B' are present in the correct order (in that case you know it's either 'AB' or 'BA').

You can also use a similar approach to solve the problem without dynamic programming, just using two pointers and checking for the presence of each character. This would be more efficient than using dynamic programming for large inputs.

One potential issue with your plan is that you didn't consider edge cases. For example, what if the string is empty? What if it only contains one or two characters?

You should also consider handling the case where 'AB' and 'BA' are present in the same position (i.e., there's a overlap).

Overall, your plan shows some good ideas, but might not be the most efficient way to solve the problem.
