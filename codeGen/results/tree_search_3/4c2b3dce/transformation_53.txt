===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if the string can be divided into two non-overlapping parts, each containing one of 'A' or 'B', and then check if these parts contain the required substrings.

Create a 2D DP array where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring from index i to j contains 'AB' or 'BA'.

There are three states:
- Start: The current position is at the start of one substring.
- End: The current position is at the end of the other substring.
- Inside: The current position is somewhere in between.

Determine states based on whether the current position is at the start of one substring, the end of the other, or somewhere in between.
- Start:
    + If the character at the current position is 'A' and the previous character was 'B', then update dp[i][j] to True for all i from 0 to j.
    + If the character at the current position is 'B' and the previous character was 'A', then update dp[i][j] to True for all i from 0 to j.
- End:
    + If the character at the current position is 'A' and the next character would be 'B', then update dp[i][j] to True for all i from i to j.
    + If the character at the current position is 'B' and the next character would be 'A', then update dp[i][j] to True for all i from i to j.
- Inside:
    + Check if the substring contains either 'AB' or 'BA'. If it does, return True.

Finally, check the last state of the DP array. If it's True, then the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA'.
