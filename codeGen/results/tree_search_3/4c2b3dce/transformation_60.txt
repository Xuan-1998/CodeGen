===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

* Pros:
	+ Allows us to efficiently scan the entire string
	+ Can potentially avoid unnecessary checks by keeping track of non-overlapping substrings
* Cons:
	+ May not be efficient for very large strings due to the potential need to re-scan the string

To improve this plan, we can consider using a more efficient algorithm like Rabin-Karp or Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithms which have better time complexity than the sliding window approach.

The current plan does not account for edge cases. For instance:

* What if the input string is empty? Should our output be "YES" (since it's technically possible to find both substrings in an empty string) or "NO"?
* What if the input string only contains one of the two substrings, but not both?

To address these edge cases, we should add explicit checks for these conditions at the beginning of our algorithm.

Finally, the plan could be improved by considering a more robust approach to detect 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap. We could consider checking if either 'AB' or 'BA' appears in the string, then check if the other substring appears in the remaining part of the string.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
