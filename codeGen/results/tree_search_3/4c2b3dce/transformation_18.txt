===BEGIN PLAN===
Does the string contain a substring 'AB' followed by 'BA'? If so, we can use this as an opportunity to split the problem into two smaller instances.
Whether the string is a concatenation of two substrings, where one contains 'AB' and the other contains 'BA'.
Determine if either 'AB' or 'BA' appears in the current window of size 2, then move to the next window of size 2
Check for consecutive occurrences of substrings
