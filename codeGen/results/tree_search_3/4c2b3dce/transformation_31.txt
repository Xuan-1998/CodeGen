===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if the string can be divided into two non-overlapping parts, each containing one of 'A' or 'B', and then check if these parts contain the required substrings.

Use a recursive function with memoization to prune unnecessary branches. Initialize a 2D boolean array dp where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring from index i to j contains the required substrings.

Base case: If the string is empty or has only one character, it does not contain the required substrings.

Recursive case:
- If the current character is 'A' and the previous character is 'B', then check if the remaining part of the string contains 'AB'. If it does, update dp[i][j] to True. Otherwise, set it to False.
- If the current character is not 'A' or 'B', or if the previous character is not 'B', then recursively call the function with the updated substring and the result will be stored in dp.

Return True if dp[0][s.length()-1] is True; otherwise, return False.
