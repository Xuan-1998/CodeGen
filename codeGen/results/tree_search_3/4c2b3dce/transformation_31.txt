===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap? 

// Correct, this approach can be used to solve the problem. The idea is to slide two pointers from the start of the string, one for 'A' and one for 'B'. When we find an 'A', we move the 'A' pointer forward, and when we find a 'B', we move the 'B' pointer forward. If we find both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap, then the string contains both substrings.

Choose state as a pair of characters in the string s, where each state represents whether 'AB' or 'BA' appears at this point.

// Correct, this choice of state is suitable for the problem. The state can be represented as (seen_A, seen_B), where seen_A and seen_B are boolean values indicating whether we've seen an 'A' or a 'B' respectively.

Apply dynamic programming with two dimensions, where one dimension represents the current character in the string and the other dimension represents whether we've seen an 'A' or not.

// Correct, this application of dynamic programming is suitable for the problem. The dynamic programming table can be represented as dp[i][seen_A], where i is the current index in the string and seen_A is a boolean value indicating whether we've seen an 'A' up to that point.

However, there's one potential issue with the plan: It doesn't handle edge cases correctly. For example, what if the input string contains only one or two characters? The dynamic programming approach might not work correctly for these edge cases.

To improve the plan, we should add some special handling for edge cases at the beginning of our algorithm.
