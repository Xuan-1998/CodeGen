===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

A possible approach could be to use two pointers to track the current position in the string. Initialize two pointers at the start of the string. As you move the pointers forward, check if the characters at the positions match the required substrings. If they do, update the pointers accordingly.

However, this plan doesn't explicitly consider the possibility that one of 'AB' or 'BA' might be contained in the other. For instance, suppose we find a substring "ABA". Our current approach would miss the fact that it contains both 'AB' and 'BA'.

To improve the plan, we should keep track of the last occurrence of each character ('A' and 'B'). When we find an 'A', update its last occurrence. Then when we find a 'B', check if it's at the correct position (i.e., after the last 'A').

This approach will ensure that we correctly identify substrings containing both 'AB' and 'BA'.
