===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if the string can be divided into two non-overlapping parts, each containing one of 'A' or 'B', and then check if these parts contain the required substrings.

The state is a boolean indicating whether the current substring contains 'AB' or not.
'State is the current substring, and transition is adding a new character to it.'

Tabulate the dynamic programming process by creating a 2D table where each cell represents whether the string up to that point contains 'AB' or not.

The transition function can be defined as follows:
- If the last added character is 'A', then there are two possibilities: 
  - The substring ends with 'B', in which case it must contain 'AB'.
  - The substring does not end with 'B', in which case we need to consider the next character.
- If the last added character is 'B', then we can immediately conclude that the current substring contains 'AB'.

The base cases are:
- An empty string does not contain 'AB'.
- A single character string only contains one of 'A' or 'B', so it cannot contain 'AB'.

With these observations, the dynamic programming process can be implemented as follows:

1. Initialize a 2D table with size (length of the input string + 1) x 2.
2. Fill in the base cases: the empty string and single character strings do not contain 'AB'.
3. For each substring from length 2 to the length of the input string:
   - If the last added character is 'A', consider the two possibilities as described above.
   - If the last added character is 'B', immediately conclude that the current substring contains 'AB'.

The final answer can be obtained by checking the bottom-right cell of the table, which represents whether the entire input string contains 'AB' or not.
