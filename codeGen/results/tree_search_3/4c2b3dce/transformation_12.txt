Determine the longest common prefix between 'AB' and 'BA', denoted by lcp. 
Initialize dp[0][0] = 1 if s[0] == lcp[0], and dp[0][1] = 1 if s[0] == lcp[1]. 
Set dp[0][0] = 0 if s[0] != lcp[0], and dp[0][1] = 0 if s[0] != lcp[1]. 
For each character c in s, from left to right:
    If c == lcp[i]:
        Update dp[i][j] accordingly for both 'AB' and 'BA'.
    Else:
        Set dp[i][j] = 0.
If any substring of s contains both 'AB' and 'BA', return "YES". 
Else, return "NO".
