===BEGIN PLAN===
Does the string contain a substring 'AB' followed by 'BA'? If so, we can use this as an opportunity to split the problem into two smaller instances.
Whether the string is a concatenation of two substrings, where one contains 'AB' and the other contains 'BA'.
Otherwise, move to the next even-indexed character
Use a 2D table to store whether each substring ending at index i can be split into two substrings with 'AB' and 'BA'
