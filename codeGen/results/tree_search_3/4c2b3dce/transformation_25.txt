===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the longest common prefix between 'AB' and 'BA', and then check if it appears in the string as a substring.

Create a dictionary dp with keys as tuples of (i, j) where i is the length of the current substring and j is 0 for 'AB' or 1 for 'BA'.

dp[i][j] is a boolean indicating whether the substring s[0:i] contains the substring 'AB' (if j=0) or 'BA' (if j=1).

Create another dictionary first_char with keys as tuples of (i, c) where i is the length of the current substring and c is the first character.

first_char[i][c] is a boolean indicating whether the substring s[0:i] starts with the character c ('A' for 'AB', 'B' for 'BA').

Initialize dp with all values as False and first_char with all values as False.

Iterate over the string from left to right. For each character, update dp[i][j] based on the following conditions:
- If the current substring s[0:i] contains 'AB' (j=0) or 'BA' (j=1), set dp[i][j] to True.
- If the current substring does not contain 'AB' or 'BA', but its first character matches with 'A' ('AB' case, j=0), set dp[i][j] to False and update first_char[i]['A'] to True. Similarly for 'B' in the 'BA' case (j=1).

Check if either 'AB' or 'BA' appears in the string by checking dp[0][0] or dp[0][1]. If both are True, return "YES". Otherwise, return "NO".
