===BEGIN PLAN===
Does the string contain a substring 'AB' followed by 'BA'? If so, we can use this as an opportunity to split the problem into two smaller instances.
Whether the string is a concatenation of two substrings, where one contains 'AB' and the other contains 'BA'.
Otherwise, move to the next even-indexed character
Use memoization to store whether the string contains 'AB' or 'BA', and then use this information to check for the other substring
