===BEGIN PLAN===
Are there any specific characters or patterns in the input string that could help us solve the problem efficiently?
Yes, we can notice that we only care about the sequence of 'A's and 'B's. So, we can define our state accordingly.

Define a state as: {bool[previous character is 'A'], bool[previous character is 'B']} to keep track of the sequence of 'A's and 'B's, and the base case could be when the string has only one or two characters.
This is a good starting point. We can represent our state using a pair of booleans: ((A_prev, B_prev), (found_A, found_B)), where A_prev is True if the previous character was 'A', B_prev is True if the previous character was 'B', found_A is True if we've seen an 'A' so far, and found_B is True if we've seen a 'B' so far.

Consider states as pairs of booleans: ((A_ prev, B_prev), (found_A, found_B)), where A_prev is True if the previous character was 'A', B_prev is True if the previous character was 'B', found_A is True if we've seen an 'A' so far, and found_B is True if we've seen a 'B' so far.
This is correct. Our state can be represented as a pair of booleans.

Use a sliding window approach to keep track of the previous characters seen, and update the state accordingly.
Yes, this is a good idea. We can use a sliding window to keep track of the previous characters seen, and update our state based on that.

However, there's one thing we might want to consider: what happens when we encounter 'A' or 'B'? Should we immediately check if we've found both "AB" and "BA", or do we need to wait until we've processed the entire string?

Also, have you considered edge cases? For example, what if the input string is empty, or contains only one character? How will your plan handle these cases?
