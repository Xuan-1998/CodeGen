===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize two pointers, start and end, to the beginning of the string.
2. Slide the window [start, end] to find all occurrences of 'AB'.
3. For each occurrence, check if the remaining part of the string (end + 1 to n) contains 'BA'. If it does, return "YES".
4. If no occurrences are found or none of them have a matching 'BA' in the remaining part, return "NO".
5. Handle edge cases:
	* If the string is empty, return "NO" immediately.
	* If the string only contains one character, check if it's either 'A', 'B', or 'AB'. If not, return "NO". If so, return "YES" (or "NO" depending on whether you want to consider single-character strings as containing both substrings).
