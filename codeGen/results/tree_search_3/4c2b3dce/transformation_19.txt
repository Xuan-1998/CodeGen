===BEGIN PLAN===
Does the string contain a substring 'AB' followed by 'BA'? If so, we can use this as an opportunity to split the problem into two smaller instances.

This intuition is correct! We can indeed split the problem into two smaller instances if the string contains 'AB' followed by 'BA'. This would allow us to recursively solve the problem for each instance.

Whether the string is a concatenation of two substrings, where one contains 'AB' and the other contains 'BA'.

This step is also correct! We can use this insight to guide our search for the presence of 'AB' and 'BA' in the string.

Determine if either 'AB' or 'BA' appears in the current window of size 2, then move to the next window of size 2

This step is where things get a bit unclear. What exactly do we mean by "window of size 2"? Are we referring to a substring of length 2? If so, how do we determine if 'AB' or 'BA' appears in this window?

Use a sliding window approach with a set data structure

This step is also unclear. What does it mean to use a sliding window approach with a set data structure? How would this help us solve the problem?

To improve the plan, I would suggest being more specific about what we mean by "window of size 2" and how we determine if 'AB' or 'BA' appears in it. Additionally, using a set data structure might not be necessary. A more straightforward approach could be to simply iterate through the string and check for the presence of 'AB' and 'BA'.

As for potential issues with the plan, one issue that comes to mind is what if the string contains only one or zero occurrences of 'AB' and/or 'BA'? How would we handle this case?

Finally, I think the plan could be improved by including edge cases. For example, what if the input string is empty? What if it contains only one character (i.e., 'A' or 'B')?
