===BEGIN PLAN===
Are there any specific characters or patterns in the input string that could help us solve the problem efficiently?
Yes, we can take advantage of the fact that 'AB' and 'BA' are non-overlapping substrings. This allows us to maintain a dynamic programming state where we only need to consider the presence or absence of these substrings at each step.

The base case could be when the length of the string is less than 3 (since 'AB' and 'BA' are at least 2 characters), in which case we can directly check for the presence of these substrings. If the length is less than 3, return "NO" as it's impossible to find two non-overlapping 'AB' and 'BA'.

Maintain two sets: one for the number of occurrences of 'AB' and another for the number of occurrences of 'BA'. Initialize both sets to an empty set.

Implement a dynamic programming approach where we iterate through the string. For each character, check if the remaining part of the string contains 'AB' or 'BA'. If it does, add the current substring to one of the sets depending on whether it's 'AB' or 'BA'.

To handle edge cases, ensure that the plan correctly handles strings with and without occurrences of 'AB' or 'BA'.
