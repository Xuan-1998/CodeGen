===BEGIN PLAN===
Are there any specific characters or patterns in the input string that could help us solve the problem efficiently?
Define a state as: {bool[previous character is 'A'], bool[previous character is 'B']} to keep track of the sequence of 'A's and 'B's, and the base case could be when the string has only one or two characters.
Consider states as pairs of booleans: ((A_prev, B_prev), (found_A, found_B)), where A_prev is True if the previous character was 'A', B_prev is True if the previous character was 'B', found_A is True if we've seen an 'A' so far, and found_B is True if we've seen a 'B' so far.
Implement memoization by using a dictionary to store the intermediate results for subproblems.
