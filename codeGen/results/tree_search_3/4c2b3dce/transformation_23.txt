The overall approach to use dynamic programming to solve this problem is correct.

However, there are a few areas that could be improved or clarified:

1. **State representation**: You mentioned using a boolean state to represent whether the prefix has been split into two non-overlapping substrings 'AB' and 'BA'. It would be more accurate to have a tuple of booleans representing the state - one for each substring.

2. **Transition rules**: When you encounter an 'A' or a 'B', you need to update the state accordingly. You could do this by checking if the current character matches the end of either substring and updating the corresponding boolean in the state tuple.

3. **Edge cases**: Make sure to consider edge cases such as an empty string, strings with only one character (both 'A' and 'B'), or strings containing neither 'AB' nor 'BA'. These edge cases should be handled correctly by your dynamic programming solution.

4. **Combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches**: This aspect is unclear from the plan alone. You could clarify how you plan to use both approaches in combination to optimize the solution.

5. **Verification**: It would be helpful to add a step that verifies whether the final state indeed represents the presence or absence of two non-overlapping substrings 'AB' and 'BA'.

6. **Time complexity**: The time complexity of your solution should be analyzed, as this is an important consideration in competitive programming.
