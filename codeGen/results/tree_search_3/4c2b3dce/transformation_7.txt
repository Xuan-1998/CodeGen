===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if the string contains 'AB' or 'BA' as a substring, then check for the remaining part of the string.

The state expression is whether the last character in the current prefix is 'A' or 'B', and the base case is when the entire string has been processed.
Define a state as a binary number where 0 represents 'A' not encountered yet, and 1 represents 'B' not encountered yet. Transition from this state to the next by flipping the corresponding bit for each character in the string.

Define a state transition function that updates the current state based on the last character seen, and use this function to generate all possible states for each prefix of the input string.

Check if any state corresponds to 'AB' or 'BA', if found then print "YES", else print "NO".
