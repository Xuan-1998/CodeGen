===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

YES, this is a great idea! We can iterate through the string and keep track of the last occurrence of each character. If we find an 'A' followed by a 'B', or vice versa, we can check if the previous occurrences were also in the correct order.

Consider a set of binary states {A, B, AB, BA} where A represents the absence of both 'A' and 'B', B represents the presence of only one of 'A' or 'B', AB represents the presence of both 'AB' and 'BA' without overlap, and BA represents the presence of 'BA' with 'A' not followed by 'B'.

YES, this is a good approach! We can use these states to keep track of the current substring's properties. By using a dictionary to store the memoized states, we can avoid redundant checks.
