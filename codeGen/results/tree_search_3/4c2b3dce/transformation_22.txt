===BEGIN PLAN===
Does the string contain a substring 'AB' followed by 'BA'? If so, we can use this as an opportunity to split the problem into two smaller instances. 
Whether the remaining part of the string after removing 'AB' or 'BA' also contains both substrings.
Consider a dynamic programming approach where each state represents whether the prefix has been split into two non-overlapping substrings 'AB' and 'BA'. The initial state is False, and when we encounter an 'A' or a 'B', we transition to True if the current character matches the end of either substring. We also maintain a boolean indicating whether the remaining part of the string after removing 'AB' or 'BA' can be split into two non-overlapping substrings. If so, we update the state accordingly.
Design a top-down dynamic programming approach using memoization to solve the problem recursively.

The plan is generally correct in that it identifies a key aspect of the problem (splitting the string into two substrings) and proposes a recursive solution. However, there are some potential issues:

* The plan does not explicitly define what constitutes a valid split into two non-overlapping substrings 'AB' and 'BA'. It's important to clarify this before designing the DP approach.
* The plan does not mention how to handle edge cases, such as an empty string or a string containing only one of the characters 'A', 'B'.
* The plan could be improved by providing more detail on the dynamic programming approach. For example, what are the base cases for the recursion? How do we define the transition from one state to another?

To improve the plan, consider adding more details on how to handle edge cases and provide a clearer definition of what constitutes a valid split.
