===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?
\

Check if the string s contains the substring 'ABA'
Use a hash set to store all occurrences of 'A' in the string, then iterate over the remaining characters to find occurrences of 'B'
