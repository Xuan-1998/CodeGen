===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the longest common prefix between 'AB' and 'BA', say it's 'A'. Then check if it appears in the string as a substring.
The state expression is dp[i] where this value is true if the remaining part of the string does not contain either 'AB' or 'BA', and false otherwise. Initialize dp[0] to False.
The choice is to see if there are two non-overlapping occurrences of 'A' and one 'B', or vice versa. Check for these patterns in the current substring using a sliding window approach.
Apply memoization by storing previously computed values of whether the remaining part of the string contains either 'AB' or 'BA'. 
When checking for patterns, if we find that the remaining part of the string contains either 'AB' or 'BA', update dp[i] to True. If not, leave it as False.
