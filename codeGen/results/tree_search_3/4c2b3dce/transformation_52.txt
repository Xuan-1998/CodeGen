===BEGIN FEEDBACK===
Your intuition that this problem is related to Dynamic Programming is correct, but it seems like you're heading towards a different approach altogether. Here are some thoughts on your plan:

The sliding window approach might not be the most efficient way to solve this problem, especially since we need to check for both 'AB' and 'BA' substrings without any overlap.

Considering the number of occurrences of each character in the string is an interesting idea, but I think it's a bit too simplistic. We'd need to count the occurrences of 'A', 'B', and other characters as well, which might not be necessary or efficient.

Using a dictionary to count the occurrences seems like a good approach, though! If we can figure out how many times each character appears in the string without counting any overlaps, that could help us determine if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' substrings.

One potential issue with your plan is that it might not account for edge cases. For example, what happens if the input string has less than 2 characters? What about strings that contain only one or zero occurrences of either character?

To improve your plan, I'd suggest focusing on counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' separately, without worrying too much about overlapping substrings. Then, we can use these counts to determine if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' substrings.

Here's an updated version of your plan:
