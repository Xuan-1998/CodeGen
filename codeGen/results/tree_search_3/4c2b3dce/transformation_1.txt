===BEGIN PLAN===
Does the string contain a substring 'AB' followed by 'BA'? If so, we can use this as an opportunity to split the problem into two smaller instances.

Whether the string contains 'AB' at a certain position.
Check if 'AB' is a prefix of the string, then check if 'BA' is a suffix.

Design a recursive function that checks if 'AB' appears at a certain position in the string, and if so, checks if 'BA' appears after that position.
