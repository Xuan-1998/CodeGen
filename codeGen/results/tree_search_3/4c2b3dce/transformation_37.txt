===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if the string can be divided into two non-overlapping parts, each containing one of 'A' or 'B', and then check if these parts contain the required substrings.

Let dp[i] represent whether the substring from index 0 to i contains 'AB'. 

Initialize dp[0] = False (no 'AB' in the empty string)
For i from 1 to n-2:
    If the current character is 'A' and the next two characters are 'B', then set dp[i] = True
    Otherwise, set dp[i] = dp[i-1]
Let seen[0][0] represent whether the substring from index 0 to i contains 'BA'. 

Initialize seen[0][0] = False (no 'BA' in the empty string)
For i from 0 to n-2:
    For j from 0 to i:
        If the current character is 'A' and the next character is 'B', then set seen[i][j] = True
        Otherwise, set seen[i][j] = seen[i-1][j]
Let ans be False. 
For i from 0 to n-2:
    For j from 0 to i:
        If dp[j] and seen[n-j-1][i-j-1], then set ans = True

Return "YES" if ans is True, otherwise return "NO".
