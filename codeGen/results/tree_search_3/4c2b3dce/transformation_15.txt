===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the string contains two non-overlapping substrings "AB" and "BA". 
First, check if "AB" appears in the string. If it does, then check the remaining part of the string for "BA". If both are present, return YES.
If not, do the same but checking for "BA" first and then "AB".
The state expression is dp[i] where this value is true if the first i characters do not contain both 'AB' and 'BA'. 
The choice is to see if there are two non-overlapping occurrences of 'A' and one 'B', or vice versa.
Initialize a variable f with True. Then iterate over the string, updating f as follows: 
- If f and "AB" appears at position i, update f as False. 
- If not f and "BA" appears at position i, update f as False. 
Finally, return 'YES' if f is still True, and 'NO' otherwise.
