===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

*Pros:*
	+ We can efficiently iterate through the string, checking for substrings
	+ No need to store the entire string, just keep track of the current "window"
*Cons:*
	+ Might be slow for long strings due to repeated checks

Maintain a dictionary where keys are character combinations and values are boolean indicating whether the combination has been seen before.

*Pros:*
	+ Can quickly check if we've already seen a specific substring
*Cons:*
	+ Might need additional data structures to handle edge cases (e.g. first/last occurrence of 'AB' or 'BA')
	+ Dictionary lookups might be slow for very large strings

Then, iterate through the string and update the dictionary as you go.

*Pros:*
	+ Can efficiently keep track of seen substrings
*Cons:*
	+ Might still be slow for long strings due to repeated checks

When you see both 'AB' and 'BA', check if the current state matches the required pattern.

*Pros:*
	+ If we've found both 'AB' and 'BA', we can quickly determine if they're non-overlapping
*Cons:*
	+ Might be slow for very large strings due to repeated checks

Utilize a trie data structure to efficiently store and query the character combinations in the string.

*Pros:*
	+ Can efficiently store and query substrings using a trie
	+ Might be faster than dictionary lookups or sliding window approach
*Cons:*
	+ Trie construction might be slow for very large strings
	+ Additional memory usage

===END PLAN===

**Feedback:**

* The plan is mostly correct, but it's not clear how you would efficiently check if the current state matches the required pattern.
* You're right that a sliding window approach could be used to find 'AB' and 'BA', but this might still be slow for very large strings.
* A trie data structure could be useful, but you need to consider how you would construct and query it efficiently.
* Edge cases haven't been fully considered (e.g. what if the string starts or ends with 'A'?).
