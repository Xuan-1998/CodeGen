===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if the string can be divided into two non-overlapping parts, each containing one of 'A' or 'B', and then check if these parts contain the required substrings.

The state is a tuple containing the counts of 'A' and 'B' in the current substring, as well as a flag indicating whether 'AB' has been found yet.

State and transition relationships are defined as follows:
    - If s[0...i] contains 'AB', then state at i+1 is (1, 0); 
    - If it contains 'BA', then state at i+1 is (0, 1); 
    - If neither 'AB' nor 'BA' appears in s[0...i], the state remains unchanged.

Maintain two counters for the occurrences of A and B respectively, and update them accordingly as you iterate through the string.

If the counts of 'A' and 'B' are both 1 when the end of the string is reached, then 'AB' and 'BA' must have been found in some order, so return "YES". 
Otherwise, return "NO".
