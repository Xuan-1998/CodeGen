===BEGIN PLAN===
Are there any specific characters or patterns in the input string that could help us solve the problem efficiently?
The base case could be when the length of the string is less than 3 (since 'AB' and 'BA' are at least 2 characters), in which case we can directly check for the presence of these substrings.
Determine if there exists a character that appears in both 'AB' and 'BA'. If yes, use this character as a pivot to partition the string into three parts.
Determine a pivot character that appears in both 'AB' and 'BA', then partition the input string into three parts based on this character, and finally check for the presence of 'AB' and 'BA' in each part.
