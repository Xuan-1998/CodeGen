===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach with two pointers (or indices) to scan the string s?
\
Check if the substring 'AB' appears in the string s without overlap. If it does, store its starting index.
If 'AB' is found, check if the remaining part of the string contains the substring 'BA' without overlap. If it does, return "YES".
If neither 'AB' nor 'BA' is found or they do appear but with overlap, return "NO".
Handle edge cases: empty string, strings with only one character.
