Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?
\
Consider the number of occurrences of each character in the string
    * Count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' separately
    * This will help us determine when we can start looking for 'BA'
Check for 'AB' substring using a sliding window approach and then check if the remaining part contains 'BA'
    * Start with a window of size 2 (since 'AB' has length 2)
    * Slide the window forward, checking each time if the current window is equal to 'AB'
        + If it is, move on to the next character
        + If not, increment the count for 'A' and check again
    * Once we've checked all the string, check if there are enough remaining characters left for 'BA'
        + Since 'BA' has length 2, we need at least 2 more characters remaining in the string
        + If this condition is met, then we can start looking for 'BA'
Check for 'BA' substring using a sliding window approach
    * Start with a window of size 2 (since 'BA' has length 2)
    * Slide the window forward, checking each time if the current window is equal to 'BA'
        + If it is, print "YES" and stop
        + If not, move on to the next character
