===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if the string can be divided into two non-overlapping parts, each containing one of 'A' or 'B', and then check if these parts contain the required substrings.

There are two states: one for the number of 'A's and 'B's seen so far that are either even or odd, respectively, and another state to track if the current position is an odd or even index. This can be represented as a 2D array where each cell represents whether the corresponding substring can be divided into two non-overlapping parts, each containing one of 'A' or 'B'.

Think about a state that represents if the current position is at the start of either 'AB' or 'BA', and another state that tracks if the next character should be an 'A' or a 'B'. This can be represented as a 2D array where each cell represents whether the corresponding substring starts with 'AB' or 'BA'.

Dynamically build a table where each cell represents whether the corresponding substring contains both 'AB' and 'BA', and then check if these parts contain the required substrings. The answer will be YES if there is at least one cell in the 2D array that has both 'AB' and 'BA', otherwise, it will be NO.
