===BEGIN FEEDBACK PLAN===
Your initial plan looks promising, but there are some areas that need further exploration.

Firstly, you're correct that dynamic programming can be used to solve this problem. However, the key insight is to recognize that we don't necessarily need to build a table for every possible substring of the input string. Instead, we can use a more clever approach by keeping track of whether the current prefix has been split into two non-overlapping substrings 'AB' and 'BA'.

You're on the right track with considering a dynamic programming approach where each state represents whether the prefix has been split into two non-overlapping substrings 'AB' and 'BA'. However, you might want to consider using a more straightforward approach by maintaining a boolean indicating whether the remaining part of the string after removing 'AB' or 'BA' can be split into two non-overlapping substrings.

One potential issue with your plan is that it doesn't explicitly account for edge cases. For instance, what if the input string consists entirely of either As or Bs? Your plan might need to be modified to handle such scenarios.

Overall, your plan has a good starting point, but it would benefit from further refinement and consideration of edge cases.
