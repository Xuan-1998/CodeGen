===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the longest common prefix between 'AB' and 'BA', and then check if it appears in the string as a substring.

Let's create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring s[0:i] contains the substring 'AB' (if j=0) or 'BA' (if j=1).

For each i from 1 to len(s), do the following:
    For each j from 0 to 1, if j==0 then consider the substring 'AB', otherwise consider the substring 'BA'.
    If s[i-1] is equal to the corresponding character in the considered substring (i.e., either 'A' or 'B'), 
        then set dp[i][j] to True.
    Otherwise, set dp[i][j] to False.

Then, check if there exists an i such that dp[i][0] and dp[len(s)-i][1] are both True. 
If so, return "YES", otherwise return "NO".
