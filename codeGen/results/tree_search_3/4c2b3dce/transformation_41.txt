===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

Consider states as tuples (left, right) representing the number of characters left in the string after considering AB or BA.

Tabulate the problem by creating a 1D array where dp[i] represents whether the substring from 0 to i contains both 'AB' and 'BA'.
