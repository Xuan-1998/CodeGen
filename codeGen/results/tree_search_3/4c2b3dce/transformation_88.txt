===BEGIN PLAN===
Are there any specific characters or patterns in the input string that could help us solve the problem efficiently?
Yes, the presence of 'A' and 'B' in the string can be used to define states.

Considering the presence of 'A' and 'B' in the string, we could define a state as: {bool['A' appears before 'B'], bool['AB' or 'BA' appear consecutively]},
This is a good start! By considering both whether 'A' comes before 'B', and whether 'AB' or 'BA' appear consecutively, you're capturing the key features of the problem.

'State' could be a boolean indicating if we've found both 'AB' and 'BA' so far, with transitions occurring when we find a new character that updates this state
This is also good! By defining a state and its transitions based on the input string, you're setting up a dynamic programming solution.

Implement memoization using a dictionary to store previously computed states and their transitions.
Yes, this is necessary to avoid redundant computation. Memoization can help reduce the time complexity of your solution.

However, I think there's a potential issue with the plan: it doesn't seem to take into account whether the 'AB' and 'BA' substrings are overlapping or not. You might need to add an additional state to track this information.

Also, you should consider edge cases! For example, what if the input string is empty? Or what if it only contains one of 'A' or 'B'? Your solution should handle these cases correctly.

Finally, I would recommend refining your plan by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and thinking about how to solve each one. This will help you develop a clear and efficient algorithm.
