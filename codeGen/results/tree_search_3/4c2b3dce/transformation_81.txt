===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

This is a good starting point! A sliding window approach can be effective for this problem.

Maintain a dictionary where keys are character combinations and values are boolean indicating whether the combination has been seen before. Then, iterate through the string and update the dictionary as you go. When you see both 'AB' and 'BA', check if the current state matches the required pattern.

This part of the plan seems reasonable. The dictionary can be used to keep track of the character combinations that have been seen so far. However, it's not clear what exactly we're looking for in terms of patterns. Are we looking for any overlap between 'AB' and 'BA', or must they appear consecutively?

Use a rolling hash function to quickly check for the presence of 'AB' and 'BA' substrings

A rolling hash function can be useful for this problem, as it allows us to quickly check if a given substring is present in the string. However, it's not clear how we would use this hash function within the context of our plan.
