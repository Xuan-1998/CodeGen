===BEGIN PLAN===
Does the string contain a substring 'AB' followed by 'BA'? If so, we can use this as an opportunity to split the problem into two smaller instances.

Whether the string contains 'AB' at a certain position.
Check if 'AB' is a prefix of the string, then check if 'BA' is a suffix.

Use dynamic programming to solve this problem by considering the last two characters of the string and whether they are 'AB' or 'BA', then recursively explore the remaining substring. This can be done as follows:

* Create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring from index i to j contains 'AB' followed by 'BA'.
* Iterate through the string, for each position, check if the last two characters are 'AB' or 'BA'. If they are, then recursively call the function on the remaining substring.
* Update the table accordingly based on the result of the recursive call.
