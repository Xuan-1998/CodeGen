===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if the string contains 'AB' or 'BA' as a substring by iterating through the string with a sliding window approach. 
For each window of size 2, check if it is either 'AB' or 'BA'. If found, mark its presence and move the window forward.
The base case is when the entire string has been processed. If we have not found any 'AB' or 'BA', return 'NO'.
If we have found both substrings in different parts of the string, return 'YES'.

Let the state be a boolean indicating whether we have seen an 'A' in the current prefix, initially set to False.
Transition from the current state to True when encountering 'A', and vice versa for 'B'. 
This will help us detect overlapping occurrences.
