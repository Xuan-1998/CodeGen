===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

Viewing the dynamic programming problem as finding the maximum length subsequence that satisfies the condition.

You can use a dictionary to store the characters you've seen so far, with their indices, and then check if there's a 'B' that comes after an 'A', which would mean we found both substrings. 

However, this plan might not be correct because it doesn't account for cases where one substring appears but not the other.

To improve this plan, we could iterate through the string twice - once to find 'AB' and once to find 'BA'.

Potential issues with this plan include:

* It doesn't handle the case where 'AB' appears multiple times in the string.
* It also doesn't handle the case where 'AB' or 'BA' appears at the start or end of the string.

To account for these edge cases, we could add additional checks to our code.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
