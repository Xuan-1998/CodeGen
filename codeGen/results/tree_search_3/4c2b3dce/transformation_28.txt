Determine the longest common prefix between 'AB' and 'BA', and then check if it appears in the string as a substring.

dp[i][j] is a boolean indicating whether the substring s[0:i] contains the substring 'AB' (if j=0) or 'BA' (if j=1).
dp[i][j] represents whether the last character of the prefix s[0:i-1] matches either the first or second character of 'AB' or 'BA'.

dp[0][0] = dp[0][1] = False, because the empty string does not contain 'AB' or 'BA'.
For i > 0, we have:

* If the current character in s[i-1] matches either the first or second character of 'AB', then
    * If j == 0, update dp[i][j] to True if and only if dp[i-1][1-j] is False (to avoid overcounting).
    * If j == 1, do nothing because we are not interested in updating dp[i][1].
* If the current character in s[i-1] does not match either the first or second character of 'AB' or 'BA', then
    * Update dp[i][0] to False and dp[i][1] to False.

Once the table is filled, we can check if there exists i such that dp[i][0] == True and dp[i][1] == False.
If yes, it means the string contains 'AB' but not 'BA', or vice versa.
If no, then it means the string does not contain either 'AB' or 'BA'.
