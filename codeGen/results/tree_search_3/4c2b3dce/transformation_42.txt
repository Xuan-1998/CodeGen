===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?
States can be transitions from a previous state, with transitions being YES if the current substring is either AB or BA, and NO otherwise.
Use dynamic programming to store intermediate results

// Issues:
- The plan doesn't explicitly consider edge cases. For example, what if the input string contains only one of 'AB' or 'BA'? Should we return 'YES' or 'NO'?
- It's not clear how you would use dynamic programming to store intermediate results. Would you be storing all possible substrings and their corresponding states? That could lead to a lot of unnecessary computation.
- The plan doesn't explicitly consider the requirement that there should be no overlap between the two substrings.

// Suggestions:
- Consider using a more straightforward approach, such as iterating over the string and checking for 'AB' and 'BA' separately. This could simplify the problem and avoid issues with edge cases.
- Instead of storing intermediate results, you could just keep track of whether you've found both 'AB' and 'BA'. If you have, return 'YES', otherwise return 'NO'.
