===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if the string can be divided into two non-overlapping parts, each containing one of 'A' or 'B', and then check if these parts contain the required substrings.

The state is a tuple containing the counts of 'A' and 'B' in the current substring, as well as a flag indicating whether 'AB' has been found yet.
Transition relationship: 
    - If s[0...i] contains 'AB' or 'BA', then state at i+1 is either (1, 0) or (0, 1), depending on whether 'A' or 'B' appears first; otherwise,
      the state remains unchanged.

Use memoization by creating a dictionary to store the intermediate results for each state (counts of 'A' and 'B', flag indicating if 'AB' has been found) as keys, 
    - and the corresponding transitions as values.

If 'AB' or 'BA' is not found in the string, return "NO" directly.
Else, recursively check the remaining substring to see if it contains the other required substring ('AB' or 'BA').
