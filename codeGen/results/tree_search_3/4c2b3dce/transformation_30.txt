===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

YES, this is a good starting point. We can slide a window of size 2 over the string s to look for occurrences of 'AB' or 'BA'.

Choose state as a pair of characters in the string s, where each state represents whether 'AB' or 'BA' appears at this point.

This choice of state seems reasonable, but we need to be more specific about what the state should represent. For example, is it "AB" seen so far, or "AB" and "BA" seen so far? We'll come back to this later.

Use a hash table to store the frequency of characters in the string and then check if it's possible to form both 'AB' and 'BA'.

This part seems unclear. What exactly do we mean by "frequency of characters"? Do we count the occurrences of each character, or something else? Also, how do we use this hash table to determine if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA'? This step needs more clarification.
