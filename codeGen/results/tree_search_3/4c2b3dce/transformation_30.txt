===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if the string can be divided into two non-overlapping parts, each containing one of 'A' or 'B', and then check if these parts contain the required substrings.
The state is a boolean indicating whether the current substring contains 'AB' or not.

Create a dynamic programming table dp of size n+1 where n is the length of the string s. Initialize all values in the dp table to False.

For each character c from 0 to n-1, if the substring from index 0 to c contains 'A' and the substring from c+1 to n contains 'B', then check if the substring from 0 to c contains 'AB'. If it does, set dp[c+1] to True.

Iterate through the dp table from right to left. As soon as you find a False value or reach the beginning of the table, return "NO" because the string cannot be divided into two non-overlapping parts that contain 'A' and 'B'.

If you reached the end of the dp table without finding any False values, then return "YES" because the string can be divided into two non-overlapping parts that contain 'A' and 'B'.
