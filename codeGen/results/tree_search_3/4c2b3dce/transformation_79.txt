Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

YES, that sounds like a good idea! A sliding window approach can be effective in finding non-overlapping substrings.

A possible approach could be to use two pointers to track the current position in the string. Initialize two pointers at the start of the string. As you move the pointers forward, check if the characters at the positions match the required substrings. If they do, update the pointers accordingly.

This is a good idea! Using two pointers can help us efficiently search for non-overlapping substrings.

Use dynamic programming to iterate through the string, checking for the presence of 'AB' and 'BA', and updating a table accordingly.

Hmm, I'm not sure this part makes sense. Dynamic programming is usually used when we need to solve problems that involve overlapping subproblems or memoization. But in this problem, we're looking for non-overlapping substrings, so dynamic programming might not be the best approach here.
