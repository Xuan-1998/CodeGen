===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

// This is a good idea! We can indeed use a sliding window approach to find substrings 'AB' and 'BA' in the given string.

Determine if there is an even/odd occurrence count for both characters

// Hmm, this doesn't seem directly relevant to our problem. We're not trying to find the total count of 'A's and 'B's, but rather check if 'AB' and 'BA' are present without overlap. This step might be unnecessary.

Use a dictionary to store the frequency count of 'A' and 'B' characters, then check if their counts are equal and not zero.

// I agree that this approach is not necessary for our problem. Instead, we can focus on finding substrings 'AB' and 'BA' using a sliding window approach.
