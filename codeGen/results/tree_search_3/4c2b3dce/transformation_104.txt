===BEGIN PLAN===
Are there any specific characters or patterns in the input string that could help us solve the problem efficiently?
Yes, we can take advantage of the fact that the problem is asking for two non-overlapping substrings "AB" and "BA". This means we only need to consider the substring from the current character to the end of the string when checking if 'AB' or 'BA' appears.

Define a state as: {bool[previous character is 'A'], bool[previous character is 'B']} to keep track of the sequence of 'A's and 'B's, and the base case could be when the string has only one or two characters.
This approach seems good. The state will help us determine if we have seen both 'A' and 'B' in the correct order.

Think of states as strings: (prev_state, curr_char), where prev_state is the state before processing the current character, and curr_char is either 'A' or 'B'.
This representation makes sense. We can use this to look up previous states in our memo dictionary.

Implement a dictionary-based memoization approach by creating a memo dictionary that maps each unique state (prev_state, curr_char) to its corresponding boolean value indicating whether 'AB' or 'BA' can be found in the remaining part of the string.
This is a good idea. Memoization can help us avoid redundant computations and speed up our solution.

However, there's one potential issue with this plan: what happens when we encounter an 'A' or a 'B' that doesn't match the previous character? In that case, we would need to reset our state to reflect the new sequence of characters. This could be handled by adding some kind of reset logic to our memoization approach.

Additionally, it's worth noting that this problem can also be solved using a two-pointer technique without dynamic programming. It might be worth exploring both approaches to see which one is more efficient and easier to implement.
