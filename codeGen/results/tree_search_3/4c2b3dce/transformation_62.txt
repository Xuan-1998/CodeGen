Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

You could use two pointers to keep track of where you are in the string, one for each substring.

Implement tabulation by using two pointers to slide through the string, checking for 'AB' and 'BA' substrings without any overlap.
