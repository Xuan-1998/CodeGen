Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

Consider the current character as either being part of an 'A' or a 'B'.

You can use dynamic programming by initializing a table and filling it up with the results of checking for 'AB' and 'BA' in each substring.
