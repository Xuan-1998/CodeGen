===BEGIN PLAN===
Are there any specific characters or patterns in the input string that could help us solve the problem efficiently?
Yes, we can observe that 'AB' and 'BA' are fixed substrings, so we can use this property to our advantage.

The base case could be when the length of the string is less than 3 (since 'AB' and 'BA' are at least 2 characters), in which case we can directly check for the presence of these substrings.
This looks good. We can handle the base case separately from the rest of the problem.

Consider maintaining a set of seen substrings, where each substring is either 'AB', 'BA', or a prefix of one of them.
This could be useful if we want to avoid checking the same prefixes multiple times. However, it's not necessary for this problem, as we only need to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA'.

Use dynamic programming to build up a table where each cell represents whether the substring ending at that position contains both 'AB' and 'BA'. Then check if the last row has any true values.
This is where things get interesting. We can use dynamic programming to build a table where each cell represents whether the string up to that point contains both 'AB' and 'BA'. However, we need to be careful about how we fill in this table.
