===BEGIN PLAN===
Does the string contain a substring 'AB' followed by 'BA'? If so, we can use this as an opportunity to split the problem into two smaller instances. // Correct! This could be a valid approach.

Whether the string is a concatenation of two substrings, where one contains 'AB' and the other contains 'BA'. // Not entirely necessary? We're not trying to find all such combinations, just if any exists. 

Otherwise, move to the next even-indexed character // What about odd-indexed characters? This might miss some cases.

Create a DP array where dp[i] is true if the substring from index 0 to i can be split into two substrings with 'AB' and 'BA' // Good idea! We could use this to keep track of whether we've seen a valid pair so far.
