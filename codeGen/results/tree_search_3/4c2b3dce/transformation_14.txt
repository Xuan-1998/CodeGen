===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the first character of the input string matches both 'A' and 'B'. If it does, set dp[0][0] to true and dp[0][1] to true. This handles the case where the longest common prefix is an empty string.

Iterate over the string from left to right. For each character, update the values of dp[i][0] and dp[i][1] based on the previous values.

For example, if we encounter an 'A', then for all subsequent indices j, set dp[j][0] to true and dp[j][1] to false (since 'AB' starts with 'A' but 'BA' doesn't). If we encounter a 'B', then for all subsequent indices j, set dp[j][0] to false and dp[j][1] to true.

Once the iteration is complete, check if either dp[m][0] or dp[m][1] is true. If it is, then the string contains two non-overlapping substrings "AB" and "BA". Otherwise, return "NO".
