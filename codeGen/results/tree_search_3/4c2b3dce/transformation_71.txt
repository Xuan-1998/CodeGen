===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

YES, this is a good idea! We can use two pointers, one at the beginning of the string and one at the end. As we move through the string, we can keep track of whether we've seen "AB" or "BA".

Design a transition function that takes the current state as input and returns the next possible states based on the characters in the string.

GOOD IDEA! The transition function could take the current state (e.g., whether we've seen "AB" or not) and the next character in the string. It would return the updated state, e.g., whether we've now seen "BA" or not.

Design a dynamic programming function that takes the current state as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the remaining part of the string can be divided into two non-overlapping substrings 'AB' and 'BA'.

EXCELLENT IDEA! This function would take the updated state from the transition function and return true if we've seen "AB" and "BA" without any overlap, and false otherwise.
