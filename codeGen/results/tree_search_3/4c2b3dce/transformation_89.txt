===BEGIN PLAN===
Are there any specific characters or patterns in the input string that could help us solve the problem efficiently?
Considering the presence of 'A' and 'B' in the string, we could define a state as: {bool['A' appears before 'B'], bool['AB' or 'BA' appear consecutively]},
This is a good starting point. By considering these states, you're effectively asking whether there are two non-overlapping substrings "AB" and "BA" in the string.

'State' could be a boolean indicating if we've found both 'AB' and 'BA' so far, with transitions occurring when we find a new character that updates this state
This is also a good idea. By updating the state based on the current character and previous states, you're effectively keeping track of whether you've seen "AB" or "BA" in the string.

Tabulate the state transitions using a function that takes the current state and the next character as input, updating the state accordingly.
This is where your plan starts to get a bit unclear. You haven't specified exactly what the state transitions should be or how they should be updated based on the current character. This could potentially lead to incorrect results if not implemented correctly.

To improve this part of your plan, you might want to consider specifying some base cases (e.g., what happens when the string starts with 'A', then 'B', then nothing else? What about if it ends with 'A' and then 'B'?), and then defining a recursive function that updates the state based on the current character. This could help ensure that your function is correct and handles all possible cases.

As for potential issues with your plan, one thing to watch out for is edge cases where your function might produce incorrect results. For example, what happens if the string is empty? What about if it contains only 'A's or only 'B's?

Overall, your plan has some good ideas and concepts, but could benefit from a bit more detail and clarity in certain areas.
