Your plan is a good starting point, but there are some potential issues to consider.

Firstly, the sliding window approach might not be the most efficient way to solve this problem. Since you're dealing with two fixed-size substrings 'AB' and 'BA', you can simply use a brute-force approach and check if either of these substrings appears in the string. If one is found, then you can check if the other substring can be formed by taking characters from the remaining part of the string.

The idea of using a dictionary to store the last occurrence of characters 'A' and 'B' is also a good approach. This could help you determine if the substrings 'AB' and 'BA' can be formed without any overlap.

However, your plan does not explicitly consider edge cases such as when the string length is less than 2 (in which case it's impossible to form either substring), or when the string contains only one of the characters 'A' or 'B'.

To improve your plan, you could add some initial checks at the beginning to handle these edge cases. You could also consider using a more efficient data structure than a dictionary to store the last occurrence of characters.

Overall, your plan is a good starting point, but it needs some refinement to handle potential issues and edge cases.
