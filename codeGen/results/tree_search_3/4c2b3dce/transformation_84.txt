===BEGIN PLAN===
Are there any specific characters or patterns in the input string that could help us solve the problem efficiently?

Yes, considering the presence of 'A' and 'B' in the string, we can define a state as: {bool['A' appears before 'B'], bool['AB' or 'BA' appear consecutively]}

Consider the states as (first_char, second_char) where first_char is either 'A' or 'B', and second_char is either 'A' or 'B'. The transitions would be based on whether the current character matches the expected next character in the substrings.

Maintain a dictionary to store the dynamic programming states and their corresponding values. Initialize the dictionary with base cases: when both characters are 'A', it's not possible for 'AB' or 'BA' to appear, so return False. Similarly, when both characters are 'B', also return False.

Transition rules:
- If the current character matches the expected next character (either 'A' or 'B'), move forward one step.
- If the current character doesn't match the expected next character and neither of 'AB' or 'BA' appears consecutively, it's not possible for both to appear in the string, so return False.

The plan can be improved by pruning unnecessary states. For example, if we find that 'A' appears before 'B', then there's no need to continue exploring the cases where 'B' appears before 'A'.

Potential issues with the plan:
- Edge case handling: The plan doesn't explicitly handle edge cases like an empty string or a string containing only one character. We should add checks for these cases at the beginning of the dynamic programming process.
- Complexity: Although the plan seems to be a good approach, it might not be efficient enough considering the constraint on the length of the input string. We should analyze the time and space complexity of this approach.

Here's an updated version of the **WHOLE** detailed plan:
