===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?  // This could be a good starting point, but may not guarantee non-overlapping substrings.

Determine if there is an even/odd occurrence count for both characters // This doesn't seem relevant to the problem, as we're looking for specific substrings rather than just counting occurrences.

Determine the maximum length of non-overlapping occurrences of 'AB' or 'BA' substringers in the string. // This could be a good direction, but may be overly complicated. We can simplify it by checking if the string contains both "AB" and "BA", without worrying about overlap.
