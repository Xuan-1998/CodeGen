===BEGIN PLAN===
Are there any specific characters or patterns in the input string that could help us solve the problem efficiently?
Yes, we can look for the character 'A' or 'B'. If we find both, then it's likely that one of them is present at the end of the string. This can be a good starting point.

The base case could be when the length of the string is less than 3 (since 'AB' and 'BA' are at least 2 characters), in which case we can directly check for the presence of these substrings.
This seems like a reasonable approach. We can simply iterate over the string to find these substrings.

Determine if there exists a character that appears in both 'AB' and 'BA'. If yes, use this character as a pivot to partition the string into three parts.
This is an interesting idea! By finding a common character between 'AB' and 'BA', we can split the string into two smaller strings. This could help us avoid unnecessary checks.

Apply memoization by storing and reusing intermediate results to avoid redundant computations.
This is a good approach, especially if the problem has overlapping subproblems. However, it's important to ensure that our memoization strategy doesn't introduce new issues or inefficiencies.
