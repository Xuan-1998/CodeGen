===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if either 'AB' or 'BA' appears in the string s as a substring.
The state expression is dp[i][j] where i is an index of s, j is 0 for 'AB' and 1 for 'BA', 
and the value represents whether the substring s[0:i] contains the corresponding substring.
Check if the string s contains 'A' followed by 'B', then check if it contains 'B' followed by 'A'.
Create a 2D array dp of size (len(s) + 1) x 2, 
where dp[i][0] represents whether the substring s[0:i] contains 'AB', and dp[i][1] represents whether it contains 'BA'. 
Fill up the dp table based on the following rules: 
dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][1] or (s[i-1] == 'A' and s[i] == 'B'), 
and dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][0] or (s[i-1] == 'B' and s[i] == 'A'). 
Finally, return 'YES' if both dp[-1][0] and dp[-1][1] are True, and 'NO' otherwise.
The plan correctly identifies the problem as a substring matching problem. It uses dynamic programming to efficiently fill up the dp table.
The potential issue with this plan is that it might be slow for large inputs due to its complexity (O(n^2)), where n is the length of the input string.
To improve the plan, we can optimize the dynamic programming by only checking the last character of each substring and its corresponding match. 
This optimization reduces the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n), making it more efficient for large inputs.
