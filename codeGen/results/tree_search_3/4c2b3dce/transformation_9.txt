===BEGIN PLAN===
Does the string contain a substring 'AB' followed by 'BA'? If so, we can use this as an opportunity to split the problem into two smaller instances.

Whether the string is a concatenation of two substrings, where one contains 'AB' and the other contains 'BA'.

If we encounter 'AB', check if the next two characters are 'BA'

Check for occurrences of both 'AB' and 'BA' in the string, then use dynamic programming to optimize the search process.
