Your intuition to use a dynamic programming approach is correct. The problem can be viewed as finding the maximum length subsequence that satisfies the condition of having both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap.

The sliding window approach you mentioned is a good idea, but it might not be necessary. Instead, we can maintain two pointers for 'A' and 'B', respectively. If we find an 'A', we move the 'A' pointer to the right. When we find a 'B', we check if the last seen 'A' is far enough (i.e., there's no overlap). If it is, we increment a counter.

The potential issue with your plan is that you didn't specify what to do when we encounter an 'A' or a 'B' that doesn't have a match yet. You might want to add checks for these cases and adjust the pointers accordingly.

As for edge cases, make sure to handle strings that contain only one type of character (e.g., all 'A's) or no characters at all.
