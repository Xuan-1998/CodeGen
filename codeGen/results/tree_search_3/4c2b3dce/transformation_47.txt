===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if the string can be divided into two non-overlapping parts, each containing one of 'A' or 'B', and then check if these parts contain the required substrings.

There are two states: one for the number of 'A's and 'B's seen so far that are either even or odd, respectively, and another state to track if the current position is an odd or even index.
Consider states for both the number of 'A's and 'B's seen so far, as well as whether the current character is an 'A' or a 'B'.

Use dynamic programming to create a 2D table where each cell [i][j] represents whether it's possible to find substrings 'AB' and 'BA' in the first i characters of the string, given that j 'A's have been seen so far.
