===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

* Pros: This approach seems feasible, as you can maintain two pointers for each substring and slide them across the string.
* Cons: It's not entirely clear how this approach would handle edge cases (e.g., what happens when the string only contains one or the other substring?) or ensure that there are no overlaps.

You could use two pointers to keep track of where you are in the string, one for each substring.

* Pros: This is a good idea! You can indeed use two pointers to slide across the string and check if either 'AB' or 'BA' appears.
* Cons: However, it's not entirely clear how you would handle cases where one of the substrings overlaps with the other. For instance, what happens when 'AB' appears at the end of the string, followed by 'B'? You'd need some mechanism to detect and handle such edge cases.

Use memoization by creating a dictionary where keys are positions in the string and values are booleans indicating if 'AB' or 'BA' has been found.

* Pros: Memoization can be helpful in reducing computational complexity. By storing the results of subproblems (in this case, whether either substring appears at each position), you can avoid redundant computations.
* Cons: However, it's not entirely clear how this would work with the sliding window approach. Would you need to maintain a separate dictionary for each pointer position? How would you handle cases where one of the substrings overlaps with the other?

Overall, your plan seems like a good starting point! You've identified some potential approaches and considerations. Here are some suggestions:

* Instead of using memoization, consider using a single boolean variable that tracks whether either 'AB' or 'BA' has been found.
* To handle edge cases, you could add additional checks to ensure that there are no overlaps between the two substrings. For instance, if you find 'AB', you could check if the remaining string contains 'BA'. If not, return "NO".
* You might also want to consider using a more formal dynamic programming approach, where you define a recurrence relation and fill in a 2D table based on that.

Keep refining your plan! I'm sure we can work together to come up with a solid solution. ===END PLAN===
