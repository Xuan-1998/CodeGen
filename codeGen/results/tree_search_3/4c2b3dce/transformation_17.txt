===BEGIN PLAN===
Does the string contain a substring 'AB' followed by 'BA'? If so, we can use this as an opportunity to split the problem into two smaller instances.
Whether the string is a concatenation of two substrings, where one contains 'AB' and the other contains 'BA'.
Whether the last encountered substring contains 'AB' and the remaining part of the string contains 'BA'
Use dynamic programming to build up a table of whether 'AB' or 'BA' appears at each position in the string, and then use this information to solve the problem.
