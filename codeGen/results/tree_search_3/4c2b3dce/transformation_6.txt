# Correct intuition on using dynamic programming to solve this problem
Does the string contain a substring 'AB' followed by 'BA'? If so, we can use this as an opportunity to split the problem into two smaller instances.
	+ Good approach! This is a classic example of divide-and-conquer strategy.

Whether the string is a concatenation of two substrings, where one contains 'AB' and the other contains 'BA'.
	+ Correct observation. We need to check if the string can be divided into two parts, each containing one of these substrings.

The current character position in the string is at an even index
	+ Hmm, not sure why this would be relevant. Are we trying to optimize something by processing only even indices? If so, it's not clear how that would help us solve the problem.

Use dynamic programming to solve this problem by iterating through the string and checking for the presence of 'AB' and 'BA' substrings.
	+ Correct approach! Dynamic programming is a good fit for solving problems involving overlapping subproblems.

Overall, your plan has some great ideas, but it could be improved with more clarity on how you intend to implement each step. For example, what does "split the problem into two smaller instances" actually mean in code terms? How will you handle edge cases like an empty string or a string containing only 'AB' or 'BA'? 

Here's my suggested updated plan:
