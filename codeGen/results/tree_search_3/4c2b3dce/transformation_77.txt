===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

Consider maintaining a set of seen characters, where each character is either 'A', 'B', or neither. Then, iterate through the string and update the set accordingly. When you see both 'A' and 'B', check if the current state matches the required pattern.

Maintain a set of seen characters and use it to avoid redundant checks
