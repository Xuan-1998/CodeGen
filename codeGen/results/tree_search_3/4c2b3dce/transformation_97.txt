Your initial plan has some good ideas, but there are also some potential issues that need to be addressed.

Firstly, you mentioned checking if there are specific characters or patterns in the input string that could help us solve the problem efficiently. This is a great idea! However, you didn't specify what kind of pattern you had in mind. I would suggest looking for repeated characters, as these could potentially be used to partition the string and reduce the number of possible substrings to consider.

Your base case is also a good idea. You're right that if the length of the string is less than 3, we can directly check for the presence of 'AB' and 'BA'. This will greatly simplify the problem.

However, I do have some concerns about your pivot character approach. If there isn't a character that appears in both 'AB' and 'BA', then what? We would need to come up with an alternative way to partition the string. Additionally, even if we do find such a character, how can we guarantee that it's the optimal choice for partitioning the string?

Lastly, I'm not entirely convinced by your use of dynamic programming. While it might be possible to use DP to solve this problem, I think you would need to come up with a more specific and well-defined approach.

As for edge cases, have you thought about what happens if 'AB' or 'BA' appears at the very beginning or end of the string? Do we need to handle these cases differently?
