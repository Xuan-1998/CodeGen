===BEGIN PLAN===
Are there any specific characters or patterns in the input string that could help us solve the problem efficiently?
Yes, we can observe that since the substrings are non-overlapping, we only need to check if "AB" or "BA" appears in the string.

Define a state as: {bool[previous character is 'A'], bool[previous character is 'B']} to keep track of the sequence of 'A's and 'B's, and the base case could be when the string has only one or two characters.
This state can be represented as an integer: 0 for an empty string, 1 for an 'A', 2 for a 'B'. The transitions would be addition of 1 if the current character matches the previous one (e.g., from 0 to 1 for 'A' after an empty string).

Implementing memoization using a decorator function to cache the results of expensive operations.
This is not necessary as we are not solving a recursive problem. We can simply iterate over the input string and update our state based on the current character.

To improve the plan, we can consider iterating over the string only once and using the state to keep track of whether "AB" or "BA" has been found. This would reduce the time complexity.

Potential issues with the plan:
1. What if the input string is empty? How do we handle this case?
2. What if the input string contains characters other than 'A' and 'B'? How do we handle this case?

Edge cases to consider:
1. An empty string
2. A string containing only one or two characters
3. A string containing both "AB" and "BA"
