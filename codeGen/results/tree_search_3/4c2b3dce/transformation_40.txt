===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

* Pros: This approach can potentially be efficient, as you don't need to consider every possible substring of the original string.
* Cons: You would still need to iterate over the entire string, which might not be efficient for very large strings.

Consider states as tuples (left, right) representing the number of characters left in the string after considering AB or BA.

* Pros: This is a good way to represent the state of your dynamic programming algorithm.
* Cons: You would need to update these states correctly based on whether you've found 'AB' or 'BA', which could get complicated.

Implement memoization using a dictionary to store the intermediate results for faster lookups.

* Pros: This can significantly speed up your algorithm by avoiding repeated calculations.
* Cons: You would need to ensure that your dictionary keys are unique and well-defined, which might not be straightforward in this case.

Some potential issues with the plan:

* What if the string contains 'AB' followed by 'BA' without any other characters in between? How would you correctly handle this case?
* If the string contains multiple occurrences of 'AB' or 'BA', how would you ensure that your algorithm correctly handles these cases?

As for edge cases, have you considered what happens when the input string is empty, contains only one character, or contains only 'A's and 'B's? How would your algorithm handle these cases?

I think this plan has some good ideas, but it might be a bit too complicated. Have you considered simplifying things by just checking if 'AB' and 'BA' are substrings of the original string, rather than trying to use dynamic programming or memoization?
