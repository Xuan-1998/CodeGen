===BEGIN PLAN===
Does the string contain a substring 'AB' followed by 'BA'? If so, we can use this as an opportunity to split the problem into two smaller instances.

Whether the string contains 'AB' at a certain position.
Consider two states: one where we have seen an 'A' but not a 'B', and another where we have seen a 'B' but not an 'A'.
Use a single variable to keep track of whether we have seen an 'A' but not a 'B', and another variable for the opposite scenario.
