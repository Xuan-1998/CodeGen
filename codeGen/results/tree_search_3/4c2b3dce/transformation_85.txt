===BEGIN PLAN===
Are there any specific characters or patterns in the input string that could help us solve the problem efficiently?
Considering the presence of 'A' and 'B' in the string, we could define a state as: {bool['A' appears before 'B'], bool['AB' or 'BA' appear consecutively]},
Consider the states as (first_char, second_char) where first_char is either 'A' or 'B', and second_char is either 'A' or 'B'. The transitions would be based on whether the current character matches the expected next character in the substrings.
Use a list to represent the tabulation, where each element is a state that stores whether 'A' appears before 'B'.
