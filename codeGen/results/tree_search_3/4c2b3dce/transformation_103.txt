===BEGIN PLAN===
Are there any specific characters or patterns in the input string that could help us solve the problem efficiently?

YES, we can look for the presence of 'A' and 'B' characters. We know that "AB" and "BA" are the only valid substrings.

Define a state as: {bool[previous character is 'A'], bool[previous character is 'B']} to keep track of the sequence of 'A's and 'B's, and the base case could be when the string has only one or two characters.

YES, this approach can help us track the sequence. We'll use a 2D array dp to store our dynamic programming results.

Think of states as strings: (prev_state, curr_char), where prev_state is the state before processing the current character, and curr_char is either 'A' or 'B'.

YES, this way we can keep track of the sequence. We'll consider two types of transitions:
- If the previous character was not 'A', then we're free to add any 'A' or 'B'. So, dp[i][state] = 1.
- If the previous character was 'A', then we know that we need an 'B'. So, dp[i][state] = dp[i-1][(false, true)].

Create a 2D array dp of size m*n (m is the number of characters in the string, n is the length of the state vector), where dp[i][state] represents whether it's possible to find 'AB' and 'BA' in the first i characters of the string given the previous sequence state.

YES, this way we can store our results. We'll fill up the 2D array based on the transitions mentioned above.
Finally, check if there exists at least one "AB" and one "BA" in the string by checking dp[m-1][(true, false)].
