===BEGIN ANALYSIS===
Your plan seems to be on the right track, but there are a few potential issues that need to be addressed.

Firstly, the dynamic programming approach you mentioned might not be necessary for this problem. You can simply use a sliding window approach as you suggested to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap.

The recursive approach to determine whether the remaining substring can be rearranged into both substrings is also a good idea, but it's important to handle edge cases correctly.

Here are some potential issues with your plan:

* What happens when the string does not contain both 'AB' and 'BA'? Your current plan doesn't seem to handle this case.
* You need to make sure that your recursive approach handles the base case correctly (i.e., what do you return if the remaining substring is empty?).
* Also, you should consider what would happen if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA', but they are overlapping. Your current plan doesn't seem to handle this case.

To improve your plan, I would suggest adding more detail on how you will handle these edge cases and potential issues.

Overall, your plan has a good foundation, but it needs some refinement to make sure it can handle all the possible scenarios.
