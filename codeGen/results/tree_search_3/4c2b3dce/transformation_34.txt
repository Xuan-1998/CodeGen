===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

The next state depends on the current character:
    - If it's 'A', transition to the state where the remaining substring contains 'B';
    - If it's 'B', transition to the state where the remaining substring contains 'A';
    - Otherwise, stay in the same state.

Apply memoization using a dictionary to store intermediate results.
However, this plan might not be optimal because:
    - It assumes that we need to check for both 'AB' and 'BA' simultaneously, which is not necessary. We can solve this problem by checking each substring separately.
    - The memoization approach might be overkill for this problem. A simpler approach would be to directly check if the string contains 'AB' or 'BA'.

A corrected plan could be:
    ===BEGIN CORRECTED PLAN===
    Check if the string contains 'AB'. If it does, return 'YES'.
    Then, check if the remaining substring (after removing 'AB') contains 'BA'. If it does, return 'YES'.
    Otherwise, return 'NO'.

This plan is more efficient and easier to understand. It also handles edge cases like an empty string or a string containing only one of 'A' or 'B'.
