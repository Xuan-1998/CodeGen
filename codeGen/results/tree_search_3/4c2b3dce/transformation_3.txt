===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if the string contains 'AB' or 'BA' as a substring by using KMP algorithm or similar approach.
The state expression is whether the last character in the current prefix is 'A' or 'B', and the base case is when the entire string has been processed.
Use a 2D table to store the dynamic programming states, with dimensions (length of string) x (boolean).
Let's say the boolean indicates whether we have seen 'A' as the last character in the current prefix.
The first row of the table corresponds to the empty string and is initialized with all False values since there are no characters to consider.
Iterate over the rest of the rows, considering each character in the input string.
For each character, update the table based on whether it's 'A' or 'B'.
If the last character in the current prefix is 'A', then for the next row, set the corresponding value to True if the new character is also 'A', and False otherwise.
Similarly, if the last character in the current prefix is 'B', then for the next row, set the corresponding value to True if the new character is also 'B', and False otherwise.
The base case is when we have processed the entire string (i.e., the last row), where we return YES if the state indicates that both 'A' and 'B' have been seen in some prefix, and NO otherwise.
