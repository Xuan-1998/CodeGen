===BEGIN PLAN===
Does the string contain a substring 'AB' followed by 'BA'? If so, we can use this as an opportunity to split the problem into two smaller instances.
Whether the string is a concatenation of two substrings, where one contains 'AB' and the other contains 'BA'.
The current character position in the string is at an even index
Tabulate the solution by creating a 2D table where each cell represents the presence or absence of 'AB' and 'BA' substrings at a particular position.
