===BEGIN PLAN===
Are there any specific characters or patterns in the input string that could help us solve the problem efficiently? 
// This is a good starting point. Since the problem only involves uppercase Latin letters, we can focus on 'A' and 'B'. 

Define a state as: {bool[previous character is 'A'], bool[previous character is 'B']} to keep track of the sequence of 'A's and 'B's, and the base case could be when the string has only one or two characters. 
// This is a good approach. By keeping track of the previous character, we can determine if it's possible to find 'AB' and 'BA' in the remaining part of the string.

Treat states as integers: 0 for an empty string, 1 for an 'A', 2 for a 'B', with transitions being addition of 1 if the current character matches the previous one (e.g., from 0 to 1 for 'A' after an empty string). 
// This is an interesting approach. By using integers, we can reduce the memory usage and make the dynamic programming more efficient.

Using a dictionary to store the dynamic programming table and initialize it with default values. 
// This is a good idea. Using a dictionary can help us quickly look up the values in the dynamic programming table, which can improve performance.
