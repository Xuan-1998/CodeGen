===BEGIN FEEDBACK===
Your plan looks good overall, but I think you might be overcomplicating things by bringing in dynamic programming. Let me break down why:
1. You're correct that the problem can be solved by finding all occurrences of 'AB' and 'BA' and checking for non-overlapping substrings. However, this doesn't necessarily require dynamic programming.
2. Your approach of splitting the problem into smaller instances when you find a substring 'AB' followed by 'BA' is a good idea. This could be done simply with two nested loops to check if there are any more occurrences of either 'AB' or 'BA'.
3. The part about keeping track of previous found indices for overlapping substrings is also a good idea, but this can be simplified by just checking if the current occurrence of 'AB' or 'BA' overlaps with the previously found one.
4. Finally, your plan does include edge cases: it checks if either 'AB' or 'BA' appears in the string, and then checks if the other substring appears in the remaining part of the string.
