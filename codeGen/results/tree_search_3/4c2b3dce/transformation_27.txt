===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the string s contains two non-overlapping substrings "AB" and "BA".
Create a 2D table dp where dp[i][0] represents whether the last i characters of the string s contain the substring 'AB', and dp[i][1] represents whether they contain the substring 'BA'.
dp[0][j] is initially set to True, since an empty string can be considered as containing both "AB" and "BA".
For each character in the string s, iterate from i=1 to len(s).
For each i, iterate from j=0 to 2 (to consider all possible cases: 'A', 'B', or neither).
If the last i-1 characters of the string s contain the substring 'AB' (if j=0) or 'BA' (if j=1), then check if the current character matches either the first or second character of 'AB' or 'BA'.
Update dp[i][j] based on this condition.
Finally, return "YES" if both dp[len(s)][0] and dp[len(s)][1] are True; otherwise, return "NO".
