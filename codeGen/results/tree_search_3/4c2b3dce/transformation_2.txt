===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if the string contains 'AB' or 'BA' as a substring. This can be done by iterating over the string and checking every 2-character window (i.e., every pair of characters) for both 'AB' and 'BA'. If either 'AB' or 'BA' is found, we know that the rest of the string will not contain the other substring.

Let's call this initial check "Phase 1".

In Phase 1, if we find 'AB', then we can stop and return "YES" because we've already found both substrings. If we don't find 'AB' but do find 'BA', then we can also stop and return "YES". If neither 'AB' nor 'BA' is found in the initial check, then we know that the string does not contain both substrings.

So, Phase 1 consists of iterating over the string and checking every 2-character window for 'AB' or 'BA'.

In Phase 2, if the string doesn't contain both substrings after the initial check, then we can just return "NO" because we've already checked the entire string. If it does contain both substrings, then we know that they are non-overlapping.

Note: The plan does not include edge cases explicitly, but we will make sure to handle them correctly in the implementation.
