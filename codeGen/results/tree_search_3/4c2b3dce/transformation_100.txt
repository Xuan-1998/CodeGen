===BEGIN PLAN===
Are there any specific characters or patterns in the input string that could help us solve the problem efficiently?

* Yes, we can check for 'A' and 'B' separately to keep track of their sequence.

Define a state as: {bool[previous character is 'A'], bool[previous character is 'B']} to keep track of the sequence of 'A's and 'B's, and the base case could be when the string has only one or two characters.

* This state definition seems reasonable. It captures the essence of the problem by keeping track of whether we've seen an 'A' or a 'B' before.
Consider states as pairs of booleans: ((A_prev, B_prev), (found_A, found_B)), where A_prev is True if the previous character was 'A', B_prev is True if the previous character was 'B', found_A is True if we've seen an 'A' so far, and found_B is True if we've seen a 'B' so far.

* This representation of states seems correct. It allows us to keep track of whether we've seen both 'A's and 'B's before, as well as the current character.
Create a dynamic programming table where each cell represents whether the substring ending at that position contains both 'AB' and 'BA' in a non-overlapping manner.

* This is the core idea behind your plan. By creating such a table, we can efficiently solve this problem by avoiding redundant checks.
