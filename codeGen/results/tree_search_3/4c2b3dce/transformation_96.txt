===BEGIN PLAN===
Are there any specific characters or patterns in the input string that could help us solve the problem efficiently? 
Yes, we can observe that both 'AB' and 'BA' are composed of two distinct characters. This might lead to a dynamic programming solution.

The base case could be when the length of the string is less than 3 (since 'AB' and 'BA' are at least 2 characters), in which case we can directly check for the presence of these substrings.

Maintain two sets: one for the number of occurrences of 'AB' and another for the number of occurrences of 'BA'.
This part seems correct. We need to track the occurrences of both substrings separately.

Use a sliding window approach to maintain a window that always contains either 'AB' or 'BA', then check if the other substring appears in the remaining part of the string.
This is where things get tricky. If we have a window containing 'AB', how do we ensure it doesn't overlap with another instance of 'AB'? We can't simply slide the window forward and backward, as that would lead to incorrect results.

What are some potential issues with this plan? 
1. Edge cases: What if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' in a single character? How do we handle that?
2. Dynamic programming might not be necessary, as we can use a simple substring search.
3. The sliding window approach is too complicated.

How can it be improved? 
Instead of using dynamic programming, consider using the KMP algorithm or two pointers to find both substrings in O(n) time complexity.

Does it include edge cases?
No, there's no explicit handling for edge cases like 'AB' and 'BA' being present in a single character.
