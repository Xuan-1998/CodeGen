===BEGIN PLAN===
Are there any specific characters or patterns in the input string that could help us solve the problem efficiently?
Yes, we can identify 'A' and 'B' as key characters to track.

Define a state as: {bool[previous character is 'A'], bool[previous character is 'B']} 
to keep track of the sequence of 'A's and 'B's, and the base case could be when the string has only one or two characters.
This is a good idea! The state will help us determine if we've seen both 'A' and 'B', which is crucial for our problem.

Treat states as integers: 0 for an empty string, 1 for an 'A', 2 for a 'B', 
with transitions being addition of 1 if the current character matches the previous one (e.g., from 0 to 1 for 'A' after an empty string).
This is also a good idea! We can use integer arithmetic to simplify our state transitions.

Dynamically creating a list of lists to represent the table, where each sublist represents the possible states at that position in the string.
Yes, this will allow us to efficiently store and look up the dynamic programming information.
