===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if the string can be divided into two non-overlapping parts, each containing one of 'A' or 'B', and then check if these parts contain the required substrings.

Consider states for both the number of 'A's and 'B's seen so far that are either even or odd, respectively. Let dp[i][j] represent whether it's possible to form a substring of length i with j 'A's. Initialize dp[0][0] = True as an empty string can always be divided into two parts.

For each character in the string:
    If the current character is 'A', update dp[i][j+1] and dp[i-1][j] based on their previous values.
    If the current character is 'B', update dp[i][j+1] and dp[i-1][j-1] based on their previous values.

The problem can be solved if there exists a pair of states (i, j) where i >= 2 and both dp[i][j] = True, indicating that the string contains two non-overlapping substrings "AB" and "BA".
