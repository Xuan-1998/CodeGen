===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

The initial idea is a good starting point. However, let's break it down further:

1. Initialize an array: This could be a 2D array or a 1D array depending on how we choose to represent the problem.

Consider the current character as either being part of an 'A' or a 'B'.

* Initialize a variable to track whether 'AB' has been found
* Initialize a variable to track whether 'BA' has been found

You can solve this problem using tabulation by initializing an array and filling it up with the results of checking for 'AB' and 'BA' in each substring.

* Use a sliding window approach to check for 'AB' or 'BA'
* For each character, update the variables accordingly
* Check if both 'AB' and 'BA' have been found
