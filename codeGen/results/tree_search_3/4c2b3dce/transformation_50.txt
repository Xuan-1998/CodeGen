===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if the string can be divided into two non-overlapping parts, each containing one of 'A' or 'B', and then check if these parts contain the required substrings.

There are two states: one for the number of 'A's and 'B's seen so far that are either even or odd, respectively, and another state to track if the current position is an odd or even index.

Think about a state that represents if the current position is at the start of either 'AB' or 'BA', and another state that tracks if the next character should be an 'A' or a 'B'.

Use dynamic programming with two states to track the count of 'A's and 'B's seen so far, as well as whether the current position is at the start of either 'AB' or 'BA'.
