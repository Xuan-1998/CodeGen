===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap.
Design a two-pointer technique where one pointer starts at the beginning of the string, and another pointer starts at the end. Move both pointers towards each other while checking for the required substrings. If you find both substrings, return "YES". If not, check if the remaining part of the string contains the other substring.
Consider edge cases: what if the string only contains one of the required substrings? Or what if it's empty?
