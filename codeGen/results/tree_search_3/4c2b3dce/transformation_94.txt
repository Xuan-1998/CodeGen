===BEGIN PLAN===
Are there any specific characters or patterns in the input string that could help us solve the problem efficiently?
The base case could be when the length of the string is less than 3 (since 'AB' and 'BA' are at least 2 characters), in which case we can directly check for the presence of these substrings.
Maintain two sets: one for the number of occurrences of 'AB' and another for the number of occurrences of 'BA'.
Use dynamic programming to precompute all possible suffixes of the input string, then check if the required substrings appear in these suffixes.

Note: Your plan does not mention how you would actually implement this dynamic programming approach. 

Some potential issues with your plan are:

- Precomputing all possible suffixes of the input string could be memory-intensive, especially for long strings.
- You don't specify what you mean by "check if the required substrings appear in these suffixes". How do you propose to do this efficiently?
- It's not clear how you would handle overlapping occurrences of 'AB' and 'BA'.

Edge cases: Your plan seems to assume that all strings are non-empty, but it might be worth explicitly considering what happens when the input string is empty or consists only of a single character.

To improve your plan, consider the following:

- Instead of precomputing all possible suffixes, consider using a more efficient data structure (like a rolling hash) to quickly check for occurrences of 'AB' and 'BA'.
- Be more specific about how you would implement this dynamic programming approach.
- Handle edge cases explicitly.
- Consider whether there are any other optimizations or simplifications that could be made.
