===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the longest common prefix between 'AB' and 'BA', and then check if it appears in the string as a substring. 
This step seems unnecessary, as we can directly check for 'AB' or 'BA' in the string.

The state expression is dp[i][j] where i is an index of s, j is either 0 for 'AB' or 1 for 'BA', and the value represents whether the substring s[0:i] contains the corresponding substring. 
This seems correct! We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.

Check if the string s contains 'A' followed by 'B', then check if it contains 'B' followed by 'A'. 
This step is unnecessary, as we are already checking for these substrings using dp table.

Create a 2D array dp of size (len(s) + 1) x 2, where dp[i][0] represents whether the substring s[0:i] contains 'AB', and dp[i][1] represents whether it contains 'BA'. 
This seems correct! We can use this dp table to solve the problem.

Fill up the dp table based on the following rules: if i is even, then dp[i][0] = dp[(i-1)/2][1] or (s[i-1] == 'A' and s[i] == 'B'), and dp[i][1] = dp[(i-1)/2][0] or (s[i-1] == 'B' and s[i] == 'A'); 
This seems correct! The even-indexed rows are used to propagate the information from the previous odd-indexed row.

if i is odd, then dp[i][0] = dp[(i-1)/2][0], and dp[i][1] = dp[(i-1)/2][1]. 
This also seems correct! The odd-indexed rows are simply copying the values from the previous even-indexed row.

Finally, return 'YES' if both dp[-1][0] and dp[-1][1] are True, and 'NO' otherwise. 
This seems correct! We can check the final state of the dp table to determine whether the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA'.
