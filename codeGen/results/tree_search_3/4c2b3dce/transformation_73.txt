===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?
// Good starting point! We can consider using a sliding window approach.

Determine if the string can be partitioned into two non-overlapping substrings 'AB' and 'BA' by considering all possible combinations of binary states.
// This might not be necessary. We don't need to consider all possible combinations of binary states. A simpler approach would be sufficient.

Iterate through the string and maintain two pointers for substrings 'AB' and 'BA', moving them towards each other until one of them reaches the end
// This is a good direction! By maintaining two pointers, we can check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap.
