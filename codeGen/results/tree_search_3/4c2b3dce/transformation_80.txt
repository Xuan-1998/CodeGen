Your plan looks good, but let's break it down step by step to make sure we cover all possible scenarios.

The approach you suggested using two pointers to track the current position in the string seems reasonable. You can start by initializing two pointers at the start of the string and then move them forward one character at a time. As you do this, check if the characters at the positions match the required substrings 'AB' or 'BA'. If they do, update the pointers accordingly.

The memoization step is also good. You can use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computations. This will help reduce the time complexity of your solution.

However, you should also consider edge cases in your plan. For example, what if the string only contains one or two characters? In this case, it would be easy to check if 'AB' or 'BA' appears in the string without using a sliding window approach.

You can also consider improving your plan by adding more detail about how you will handle the memoization step. Will you use dynamic programming with a 2D array or memoization with a dictionary?

Overall, your plan seems solid, but it's always good to think about edge cases and potential issues that might arise during the implementation.
