===BEGIN PLAN===
Check if the string can be divided into two non-overlapping parts, each containing one of 'A' or 'B', and then check if these parts contain the required substrings.

Let dp[i] be a boolean indicating whether the substring s[0..i] contains both 'AB' and 'BA'.

For i from 1 to s.length:
    If s[i-1] is 'A' and s[i] is 'B', then set dp[i] to True
    Else if s[i-1] is 'B' and s[i] is 'A', then set dp[i] to True
    Otherwise, set dp[i] to False

Check for non-overlapping substrings:
For i from 0 to s.length - 2:
    If dp[i] is True and s.substring(i+2) contains "AB" or "BA", then return YES
Return NO if no such i exists
