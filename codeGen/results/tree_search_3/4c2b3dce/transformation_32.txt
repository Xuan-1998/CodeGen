===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

YES, this can be a good starting point. We can maintain two pointers, one at the start of the string and one at the end, and move them towards each other while checking for 'AB' or 'BA'.

Choose state as a pair of characters in the string s, where each state represents whether 'AB' or 'BA' appears at this point.

This is a good idea. We can keep track of whether we've seen 'AB', 'BA', or neither so far. This will help us determine when we've reached an impossible situation (e.g., if we've seen both 'AB' and 'BA' but haven't reached the end of the string).

Implement a sliding window approach by maintaining a window of characters that contains either 'AB' or 'BA', and then check if this window can be extended to cover the entire string.

This is where things get interesting. We need to think about how we'll handle when we've seen both 'AB' and 'BA', but haven't reached the end of the string yet. One way to do this is to keep track of whether the remaining part of the string could contain either 'AB' or 'BA'.

===END PLAN===

FEEDBACK:

Your plan looks good overall! You're on the right track with using a sliding window approach and keeping track of the state of the string.

IMPROVEMENTS:

One potential improvement is to handle edge cases more explicitly. For example, what if the input string contains only one or two characters? How will your plan handle these cases?

ISSUES:

One issue I see is that you might end up checking for 'AB' and 'BA' multiple times unnecessarily. You could potentially optimize this by keeping track of whether you've seen each substring already.

EDGE CASES:

You should definitely think about edge cases, such as strings with only one or two characters, or strings where 'AB' or 'BA' appears at the very end. Your plan seems to be on the right track for handling these cases, but it's always good to double-check!

OVERALL:

Your plan is a great start! With some minor tweaks and explicit handling of edge cases, I think you'll have a solid solution.
