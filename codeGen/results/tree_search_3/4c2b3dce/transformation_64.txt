===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?

// Issue: This is more like an intuition than a clear plan. We need to break it down further.

The dynamic programming table would store whether the string seen so far can be rearranged into both substrings.

// Good start! This gives us a direction for our solution.

Maintain two pointers for the current and previous characters, updating them as you scan the string to detect non-overlapping occurrences of 'AB' and 'BA'.

// Not bad! This could work. But we need to be more specific about what these pointers are and how they're updated.
