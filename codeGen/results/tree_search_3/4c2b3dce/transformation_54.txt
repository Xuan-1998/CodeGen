===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use a sliding window approach to check if the string contains both 'AB' and 'BA' without any overlap?
\ Yes, this is a good idea. We can slide a window of size 2 over the string, checking for occurrences of "AB" or "BA". This will help us identify non-overlapping occurrences.

Determine if there is an even/odd occurrence count for both characters
\ Good point! Since we're looking for two non-overlapping substrings, we can keep track of the counts of 'A' and 'B'. If the counts are even, it means we've found one occurrence of "AB" or "BA", so we can start checking again from where we left off.

Create a table with a size of s.length() + 1 and fill it in a bottom-up manner by considering the current character and previous two characters.
\ Hmm, I think this part might be overcomplicating things. We don't need a table to keep track of counts; just keeping track of whether we've seen an 'A' or 'B' will suffice.
