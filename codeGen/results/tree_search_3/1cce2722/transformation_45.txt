The overall strategy is correct, but there are some minor improvements that can be made.

Think about using dynamic programming with a 2D array to store the maximum points that can be earned after deleting k elements from a subsequence of length i. This can be represented as dp[i][k] = maximum points that can be earned after deleting k elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai.

The state expression is correct: dp[i][k] represents the maximum points that can be earned after deleting k elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai. However, it's important to note that we're considering a dynamic programming approach with memoization.

The transition relationship is also correct: if ai == ak + 1 or ai == ak - 1 then delete ai and recursively solve for dp[i-1][k-1], else do not delete ai and recursively solve for dp[i-1][k].

Using memoization with a dictionary to store the maximum points earned after deleting k elements from subsequence i, with initialization memo[0][k] = 0 and transition relationship: if ai == ak + 1 or ai == ak - 1 then delete ai and recursively solve for memo[i-1][k-1], else do not delete ai and recursively solve for memo[i-1][k].

However, there is a small improvement that can be made to the plan. Instead of initializing memo[0][k] = 0, we should initialize dp[0][k] = k for all k because if the subsequence only contains one element, then we have k options to delete (or not delete) this element.

This approach does account for edge cases: the base case is handled correctly when i = 0 or k = 0.

The plan can be improved by adding a base case for dp[0][k] and memoizing the values of dp[i-1][k-1] and dp[i-1][k] instead of just storing them in a dictionary. This will help reduce the time complexity of the solution.
