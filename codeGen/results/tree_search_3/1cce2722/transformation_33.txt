Instead, opt for a bottom-up approach where you tabulate the maximum points that can be earned by deleting elements from subsequences, filling in the table row by row or column by column.

The state can be represented by dp[i] which stores the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai for each possible value of ak in the range [0, 105].

dp[i] can be defined as the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai for each possible value of ak in the range [0, 105], considering only two cases: either ai is not deleted or it's deleted along with all elements equal to aj + 1 and aj - 1.

Frequently update the state with the help of previously computed states and the current state.
