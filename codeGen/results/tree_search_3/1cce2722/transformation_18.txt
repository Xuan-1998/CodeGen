Instead, opt for a bottom-up approach where you tabulate the maximum points that can be earned by deleting elements from subsequences, filling in the table row by row or column by column. This is indeed a dynamic programming problem.

Let the state be dp[i][k] which represents the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai such that the last element in the subsequence is ak. You are correct in considering this as the state for your dynamic programming approach.

The transition function dp[i][k] = dp[i-1][k-1] + (ai != ak) is also correct. This means that if the current element ai is different from the target element ak, you can earn a point by deleting ai and all elements equal to ak+1 and ak-1.

You are right in applying memoization using a dictionary where the key is a tuple of the subsequence index i and element value k, and the value is the calculated dp[i][k]. This will help you avoid redundant calculations and improve the efficiency of your dynamic programming approach.

One potential issue with this plan could be the handling of edge cases. Specifically, what happens when the target element ak is the first or last element in the sequence? You need to consider these cases separately and modify the transition function accordingly.

Another potential issue is that you might end up considering too many subproblems in your dynamic programming approach. This could lead to an exponential time complexity if not handled properly.

To improve this plan, you can further optimize the transition function by only considering relevant elements in the subsequence. For example, you can stop considering elements when ai equals ak or is greater than 105 (as per the constraint).

This plan does include edge cases: handling the first and last elements in the sequence. However, it would be good to add more explicit checks for these cases in the transition function.

Overall, your plan seems correct, but as always, careful consideration of edge cases and potential optimization opportunities is crucial.
