===BEGIN PLAN===
Instead, opt for a bottom-up approach where you tabulate the maximum points that can be earned by deleting elements from subsequences, filling in the table row by row or column by column.

Let dp[i][k] represent the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai such that the last element in the subsequence is ak. 

Here's how you can solve this problem:

- Initialize a 2D table with dimensions (n+1) x (max(a1, a2, ..., an) + 1), where n is the length of the sequence and max(a1, a2, ..., an) is the maximum value in the sequence.

- Iterate over each element i from 0 to n.
For each i, iterate over each possible last element k from min(a1, a2, ..., ai) to max(a1, a2, ..., an).

- For dp[i][k], calculate the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai such that the last element in the subsequence is k. 

  - This can be done by considering three cases: 
    - Case 1: If ak+1 exists and equals k, then you can earn one point for every element j such that aj = k+1.
    - Case 2: If ak-1 exists and equals k, then you can earn one point for every element j such that aj = k-1.
    - Case 3: Otherwise, you can earn zero points.

- Return the maximum value in the last row of the table.
