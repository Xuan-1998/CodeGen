===BEGIN PLAN UPDATE===
Your initial plan shows great insight into using dynamic programming to solve this problem. Here's my feedback:

1. Top-down approach: Your idea of recursively exploring all possible sequences of deletions is a good starting point. This can help you identify the maximum points earned at each step.

2. State expression: Defining dp[i] as the maximum points earned by deleting at most i elements from the sequence is correct. The base case when i = 0 is also a good choice, as it represents no elements left to delete.

3. Transition relationship: Your formula for calculating dp[i] based on all possible deletions until the current element looks correct. This considers ai != ak + 1 and ai != ak - 1 to avoid unnecessary calculations.

4. Bottom-up approach: Implementing dynamic programming using a bottom-up approach by constructing the dp array from left to right can be a good alternative. This could help in reducing the time complexity of your algorithm.

However, I would suggest adding more clarity on how you plan to handle edge cases and potential issues with your plan:

- How will you handle the case when ai = ak + 1 or ai = ak - 1? Your current transition relationship does not account for this. You may need to add additional checks or modifications to the formula.

- What about the case when i is very close to n, and most of the elements have been deleted? How will you handle this edge case?

- Are there any potential issues with your plan that could lead to incorrect results or infinite loops?

To improve your plan, I would suggest breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems and analyzing how these sub-problems relate to each other. This can help in identifying a more efficient solution.
