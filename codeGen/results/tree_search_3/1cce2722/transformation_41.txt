===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about using dynamic programming with a 2D array to store the maximum points that can be earned after deleting k elements from a subsequence of length n.

The state expression is dp[i][k] = maximum points that can be earned after deleting k elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai.
dp[i][k] is the maximum points that can be earned by either deleting element ai and recursively solving for dp[i-1][k-1], or not deleting element ai and recursively solving for dp[i-1][k].

Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming state, with dimensions (n+1) x (n//2 + 1), where n is the length of the input sequence.

The plan seems correct in terms of using dynamic programming to solve this problem. However, there are some potential issues that need to be addressed:

* The dimension of the 2D array needs to be carefully considered to avoid overflow or unnecessary computations.
* The base case for the recursion needs to be defined clearly to ensure the function terminates eventually.
* Edge cases should be handled separately, such as when k = 0 or i = 0.

To improve the plan, it would be helpful to:

* Define a clear recurrence relation between dp[i][k] and dp[i-1][k-1], or dp[i-1][k].
* Consider using memoization or tabulation to store the intermediate results of the dynamic programming computation.
* Test the plan with edge cases and small inputs to ensure it is working correctly.

Overall, your plan seems like a good starting point for solving this problem. With some careful consideration of the potential issues and improvements, you should be able to develop an efficient solution.
