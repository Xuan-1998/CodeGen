===BEGIN PLAN===
Instead, opt for a bottom-up approach where you tabulate the maximum points that can be earned by deleting elements from subsequences, filling in the table row by row or column by column.

Define dp[i][0] and dp[i][i] as base cases: dp[0][k] = 0 for all k, and dp[i][i] = i for all i. The state expression can be dp[i][k].

dp[i][j] is equal to the maximum of two cases:
- If there's no more points to earn after current element, then dp[i][j] = i - 1.
- Otherwise, consider deleting elements equal to ak + 1 and ak - 1. In this case, transition relationship is: dp[i-1][k-1] or dp[i-1][k+1].

Use memoization to store the maximum points that can be earned by deleting elements from subsequences and reuse previously computed values to avoid redundant computations.

To improve the plan:
* Consider handling edge cases explicitly. For example, what if i = 0? Or k is not within the valid range?
* Think about how you would initialize the dp table and iterate over the indices.
* Be careful when updating the dp values, as it's easy to introduce errors in the transition relationships.

The plan seems correct in terms of the overall approach. However, potential issues could arise from:
* Failing to handle edge cases correctly.
* Not considering all possible deletion scenarios.
* Not initializing the dp table properly or not iterating over indices correctly.

The plan does include some edge cases (base cases), but it's still important to consider other edge cases and ensure that they are handled correctly.
