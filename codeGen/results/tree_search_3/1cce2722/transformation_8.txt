Your plan looks correct, but there are a few points to consider:
- The dynamic programming approach seems to be suitable for this problem. You're right that the key idea is to explore all possible sequences of deletions.
- Your base case is correct: when i = 0, no elements left to delete means you have earned 0 points so far. This makes sense because there are no more operations to perform.
- The transition relationship dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) if i > 0 and ai != ak + 1 and ai != ak - 1 is correct too! You're considering the maximum points earned by not deleting the current element, plus one point for that element, and also considering the possibility of skipping the last two elements in the sequence.
- Your idea about implementing this problem using top-down dynamic programming with a function that takes the current index i, the maximum points earned so far, and the last two elements in the sequence as parameters is great! This will allow you to explore all possible sequences of deletions correctly.

However, here are some suggestions for improvement:
- You might want to consider handling edge cases better. For instance, what if ai = ak + 1 or ai = ak - 1? Should these be included in the transition relationship?
- It's also worth considering memoization to store and reuse previously computed values of dp[i]. This can help you avoid redundant calculations.
- Finally, it might be helpful to include some examples or test cases to validate your approach. This will ensure that your solution is correct.

Overall, your plan looks solid! With some refinement and careful attention to edge cases, I think this should give you a good chance of solving the problem correctly.
