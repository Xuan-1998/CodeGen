===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a top-down approach where you recursively explore all possible sequences of deletions, keeping track of the maximum points earned at each step and storing this information in a memo dictionary.

The state expression is dp[i][k] = max points earned by deleting up to i elements, considering k as the last element in the sequence.
dp[i][k] = max { dp[j][a[j]] + 1 | j < i, k-1 in range(a[j]) and k+1 in range(a[j]) }

The plan is correct in its approach. However, there are a few improvements that can be made:

* Instead of using recursion, consider using dynamic programming with two loops to compute the dp[i][k] values. This will significantly reduce the time complexity.

Potential issues with the plan:
* The plan assumes that the input sequence does not contain any duplicate elements. If it does, the plan may not work correctly.
* The plan does not handle edge cases such as an empty sequence or a single-element sequence.

To improve the plan and handle edge cases:

* Initialize the memo dictionary to store the results of subproblems. This will avoid duplicate computations.
* Add base cases for the recursive function to handle edge cases such as an empty sequence or a single-element sequence.
* Use two loops to compute the dp[i][k] values instead of recursion.
