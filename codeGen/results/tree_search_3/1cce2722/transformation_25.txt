===BEGIN PLAN===
Instead, opt for a bottom-up approach where you tabulate the maximum points that can be earned by deleting elements from subsequences, filling in the table row by row or column by column.

Define dp[i][0] and dp[i][i] as base cases: dp[0][k] = 0 for all k, and dp[i][i] = i for all i. The state expression can be dp[i][j].
dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the subsequence a[0...i] such that ak = j.

Use a priority queue to keep track of the maximum points that can be earned by deleting elements from subsequences
