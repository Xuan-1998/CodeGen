Your plan looks good, but I'd like to suggest some minor improvements.

1. You could start by defining the base case for dp[i][k]. This would be when i = 0 or k = 0, in which case the maximum points that can be earned is simply 0.

2. In your recurrence relation, you mentioned "dp[i-1][k-1][2]". I'm not sure what you meant by this, but it seems like there might be some confusion about how to handle the cases where ai + 1 or ai - 1 are in the subsequence. It would be helpful to clarify this.

3. You didn't mention anything about edge cases. For example, what if k is greater than i? Or what if k is less than 0?

4. Your plan does not address how to initialize the dp array. This could potentially lead to incorrect results if the array is not properly initialized.

5. There's no mention of how to handle the case where ai + 1 or ai - 1 are in the subsequence. It would be helpful to clarify this.
