===BEGIN PLAN REVISION AND FEEDBACK===
Your initial plan is correct, and I'll provide feedback and suggestions to improve it.

The bottom-up approach using dynamic programming is a great idea. Here's a revised version of your plan with some additional details:

===PLAN REVISED VERSION===
Instead of using a top-down or recursive approach, let's use a bottom-up approach where we tabulate the maximum points that can be earned by deleting elements from subsequences.

Define dp[i][k] as the state variable, which represents the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the subsequence a1, ..., ai with the last element being ak. The base cases are:

* dp[0][k] = 0 for all k: This makes sense because there are no elements to delete when i is 0.
* dp[i][i] = i for all i: When i is equal to the current index, we can earn points by deleting the last element (or not deleting it). The maximum number of points earned would be i.

The transition relationship can be described as:

* If there's no more points to earn after the current element (i.e., ak+1 and ak-1 don't exist or have already been deleted), then dp[i][k] = i - 1.
* Otherwise, consider two options:
	+ Delete the current element (ak) along with all elements equal to ak + 1 and ak - 1. In this case, we earn points by deleting these elements, so dp[i][k] = dp[i-1][k-1] or dp[i-1][k+1].
	+ Don't delete the current element (ak). In this case, we can earn points by deleting elements in the subsequence a1, ..., ai - 1. So, dp[i][k] = dp[i-1][k].

Use a bottom-up approach where you initialize the table with base cases dp[0][k] = 0 for all k, and dp[i][i] = i for all i.

===FEEDBACK AND SUGGESTIONS===
Your initial plan is correct, but here are some additional suggestions to consider:

* When defining the state variable dp[i][k], you might want to specify that k represents the index of the last element in the subsequence.
* You can improve the readability of your plan by adding more descriptive comments and breaking it down into smaller sections or steps.

===POTENTIAL ISSUES AND EDGE CASES===
When implementing this plan, you should consider potential issues and edge cases, such as:

* Handling invalid input (e.g., non-integer values in the sequence).
* Dealing with edge cases where i is 0 or 1.
* Ensuring that your dynamic programming approach correctly handles the base cases.

By addressing these potential issues and edge cases, you can improve the robustness of your solution.
