Your plan looks solid, but there are a few minor issues that could be addressed.

Firstly, you're right to use a top-down approach with dynamic programming. This is because the problem involves finding the maximum number of points earned by deleting elements from the sequence. This suggests that we need to consider all possible sequences of deletions and keep track of the maximum points earned at each step.

Your state expression dp[i] = maximum points earned by deleting at most i elements from the sequence makes sense, as you're essentially trying to find the maximum number of points earned after deleting at most i elements. The base case when i = 0 is also correct, since this represents the situation where no more elements can be deleted.

However, I have some minor suggestions:

* When you define dp[i], you could explicitly state that it's the maximum number of points earned by deleting at most i-1 elements from the sequence and then choosing whether to include or exclude the current element. This would make your transition relationship clearer.
* You mention a memo dictionary but don't explain how it would be used. If you're planning to use memoization, it would be helpful to describe this process in more detail.

Overall, I think your plan is good, and with some minor tweaks, it could be even stronger! Keep up the good work!
