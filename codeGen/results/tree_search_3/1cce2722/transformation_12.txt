===BEGIN PLAN REVISION===
Consider a top-down approach where you recursively explore all possible sequences of deletions, keeping track of the maximum points earned at each step and storing this information in a memo dictionary.

Define the state expression as dp[i] = maximum points earned by deleting at most i elements from the sequence. The base case should be when i = 0, which means no elements left to delete.

Define dp[i] as maximum points earned by deleting at most i elements from the sequence, considering all possible deletions until the current element. The transition relationship is correct, but we need to consider a few edge cases and potential issues:

* When ai == ak + 1 or ai == ak - 1, we should not delete these elements, as per the problem statement.
* For i > 0, if ai != ak + 1 and ai != ak - 1, we can delete this element along with all its neighbors (ak + 1 and ak - 1). The transition relationship becomes dp[i] = max(dp[j] + (i-j) for j in range(i-2)).

To avoid redundant computation, use a memo dictionary to store intermediate results. Initialize the memo dictionary with dp[0] = 0, as no points are earned by deleting nothing.

Consider using a loop instead of recursion to avoid potential stack overflow issues when dealing with large input sizes.

Edge cases:
* When n == 1, return 0, as there is only one element and we cannot delete anything.
* When the sequence contains all unique elements, return n-1, as we can delete all but one element.
