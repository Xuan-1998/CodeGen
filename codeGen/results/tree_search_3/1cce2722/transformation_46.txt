===BEGIN FEEDBACK===
Your plan seems to be correct and well-structured. You have identified dynamic programming as the suitable approach for this problem, which involves finding the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from a sequence.
The state expression dp[i][k] = maximum points that can be earned after deleting k elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai is clear and well-defined. The transition relationship you've described seems to accurately capture the rules for deleting elements.
One potential issue with your plan is that it does not explicitly handle the edge cases where i=0 or k=0. You may want to add these cases as base cases in your dynamic programming approach.

To further improve your plan, you could also consider adding a memoization mechanism to avoid redundant computations during the dynamic programming process. This can be achieved by storing the computed values of dp[i][k] in an auxiliary array and checking for their presence before performing calculations.
Your plan seems to cover most edge cases, but it would be helpful to explicitly mention how you would handle cases where n=0 or k=n.
