===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach where you recursively explore all possible sequences of deletions, keeping track of the maximum points earned at each step and storing this information in a memo dictionary. 

The state expression is dp[i][k] = max points earned by deleting up to i elements, considering k as the last element in the sequence.

To avoid redundant computations and improve efficiency, use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach and create a table where the state dp[i] represents the maximum points earned by deleting up to i elements. 

The recursive formula can be represented as:

dp[i][k] = max { dp[j][a[j]] + 1 | j < i, (k - 1) <= a[j] && a[j] <= (k + 1) }

This plan seems correct in terms of capturing the dynamic programming nature of the problem. However, it's essential to consider edge cases and potential issues.

Some potential issues with this plan include:
- Handling the base case where i is 0: In this case, dp[0][k] should be initialized to some default value or a special state.
- Dealing with the case where k is not present in the sequence: This could happen when the last element in the sequence is removed. The plan should handle such cases.

To improve this plan, consider the following steps:
1. Initialize dp[i][k] for i = 0 and k ranging from the minimum to maximum value in the sequence.
2. For each i, update dp[i][k] by considering all possible deletions that can occur at this point. This involves iterating through the previous states (j) and updating dp[i][k] accordingly.

This plan should capture the essence of the problem and provide a solid foundation for a dynamic programming solution. However, it's crucial to handle edge cases and potential issues carefully.
