===BEGIN FEEDBACK AND ANALYSIS===
Your initial intuition that this problem is related to dynamic programming is correct! Your top-down approach with recursive function calls and memoization can be an effective way to solve this problem.

The state expression you defined, dp[i] = maximum points earned by deleting at most i elements from the sequence, seems reasonable. The base case when i = 0 makes sense, as there are no more elements left to delete. 

However, your transition relationship could be improved. You mentioned choosing between not deleting the current element and deleting it along with its neighbors (ak + 1 and ak - 1). But you didn't specify how to handle the case where the current element is equal to either of these two values.

You also need to consider edge cases, such as when all elements in the sequence are equal or when there's only one element left. In this case, it might not be possible to delete any more elements without violating the rules, so you should handle these cases separately.

Another potential issue is that your plan doesn't specify how to initialize the dp array before filling it with values. You need to decide what value to assign to dp[0] and dp[-1], as these indices might not have a corresponding element in the original sequence.

Overall, your plan has a good starting point, but you should refine it to handle edge cases and improve the transition relationship.
