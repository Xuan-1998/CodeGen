===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a top-down approach where you recursively explore all possible sequences of deletions, keeping track of the maximum points earned at each step and storing this information in a memo dictionary.

The state expression is dp[i][k] = max points earned by deleting up to i elements, considering k as the last element in the sequence.
dp[i][k] = max { dp[j][a[j]] + 1 | j < i, a[j] == k-1 || a[j] == k+1 }

Implement a bottom-up approach by filling up the table in order of increasing i and k values, using previously computed values to fill in the current cell.
