===BEGIN PLAN REVISION AND ANALYSIS===
Let's review and analyze your plan:

1. Instead, opt for a bottom-up approach where you tabulate the maximum points that can be earned by deleting elements from subsequences, filling in the table row by row or column by column.

**Correct**: This is a good start. Dynamic programming is suitable for this problem because it involves finding optimal solutions to subproblems.

2. Define dp[i][0] and dp[i][i] as base cases: dp[0][k] = 0 for all k, and dp[i][i] = i for all i.

**Correct**: These are good base cases. The dp[0][k] = 0 part ensures that the first element in the sequence contributes no points to the maximum score. The dp[i][i] = i part means that deleting all elements except the current one yields a score equal to the number of remaining elements.

3. The state expression can be dp[i][k].

**Correct**: This is a good representation of the problem's dynamic programming formulation.

4. dp[i][j] is equal to i - 1 if there's no more points to earn after current element, and the transition relationship is: dp[i-1][k-1] or dp[i-1][k+1].

**Correct**: This transition relationship captures the essence of the problem. If the current element has no adjacent elements with the same value (i.e., there are no more points to earn), then the maximum score for the subsequence is i - 1. Otherwise, we need to consider the maximum scores for the subsequences that end at k - 1 and k + 1.

5. Apply dynamic programming by filling in the table row by row or column by column, updating dp[i][j] based on the transition relationship dp[i-1][k-1] or dp[i-1][k+1].

**Correct**: This is a good approach to fill in the dynamic programming table.

**Improvement suggestions:**

* Clarify the edge cases: What happens when k = 0? You might want to add more base cases.
* Consider the constraints: The input sequence can have at most 10^5 integers, and each integer ai is between 1 and 10^2. This might affect your choice of data structures or algorithms.

**Potential issues with the plan:**

* The dynamic programming formulation does not explicitly consider the constraint that we cannot delete adjacent elements. You should ensure that this constraint is implicitly or explicitly accounted for in your transition relationship.
* The problem statement does not specify whether ties are allowed (e.g., can you earn points by deleting all occurrences of a particular value?). Clarify this aspect, and adjust the plan accordingly.

**Edge cases:**

* What happens when k = 0? You might want to add more base cases.
* What if there's only one element in the sequence? Or two elements with the same value?

Overall, your plan has a good foundation. With some refinements and consideration of edge cases, it can be further improved to tackle this problem effectively.
