===BEGIN PLAN===
Instead, opt for a bottom-up approach where you tabulate the maximum points that can be earned by deleting elements from subsequences, filling in the table row by row or column by column.

The state can be represented by dp[i] which stores the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai for each possible value of ak in the range [0, 105].

dp[i] can be defined as the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai for each possible value of ak in the range [0, 105], considering dp[i-1] and the previous element aj to decide whether to delete or not

Use a 2D table to store the maximum points for each subsequence and each possible value of ak
