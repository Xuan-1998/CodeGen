===BEGIN FEEDBACK PLAN===
Your plan seems to be on the right track, using dynamic programming to solve this problem.

Firstly, the idea of tabulating the maximum points that can be earned by deleting elements from subsequences is a good one. This approach allows you to avoid recomputing the same subproblems multiple times.

One potential issue with your plan is that it doesn't seem to account for the fact that the player can choose an element and delete it along with all elements equal to ak + 1 and ak - 1. Your dp[i][k] state only seems to consider whether or not ai equals ak, but what about the other elements in the subsequence? 

Another potential issue is that your plan doesn't seem to handle edge cases well. For example, what if the sequence starts with a number that has no predecessor (i.e., it's the first element in the sequence)? Your dp[i][k] state seems to assume that every element has a predecessor, but this isn't necessarily true.

To address these issues, you might consider adding an additional state variable that keeps track of whether or not there is a predecessor for each element in the subsequence. This could be done by initializing the first row of your dp array to 0 for all columns (since there are no predecessors at the beginning of the sequence), and then updating the rest of the dp array based on this state.

Finally, you might consider adding some additional logic to handle cases where the player chooses an element that has no successor or predecessor. This could involve checking whether or not the chosen element is the first or last in the subsequence, and if so, adjusting your points calculation accordingly.

Overall, your plan seems like a good starting point, but it might benefit from some additional thought and refinement to handle edge cases and account for the fact that the player can choose an element and delete it along with all elements equal to ak + 1 and ak - 1.
