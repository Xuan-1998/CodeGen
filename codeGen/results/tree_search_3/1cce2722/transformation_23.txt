===BEGIN PLAN===
Instead, opt for a bottom-up approach where you tabulate the maximum points that can be earned by deleting elements from subsequences, filling in the table row by row or column by column.

Define dp[i][0] and dp[i][i] as base cases: dp[0][k] = 0 for all k, and dp[i][i] = i for all i. The state expression can be dp[i][k].
dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the subsequence a[0...i] such that ak = j.

Fill in the table row by row: 
dp[i][k] = max(dp[i-1][l] + (a[i] == k) for l in range(k-1, k+2))
