===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about using dynamic programming with a 2D array to store the maximum points that can be earned after deleting k elements from a subsequence of length n.
The state expression is dp[i][k] = maximum points that can be earned after deleting k elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai.
dp[i][k] is the maximum points that can be earned by either deleting element ai and solving for dp[i-1][k-1][2] where k-1 is the number of elements to be deleted after deleting ai, or not deleting element ai and recursively solving for dp[i-1][k].
Implement a top-down dynamic programming approach by using recursion and memoization to store the results of subproblems.
