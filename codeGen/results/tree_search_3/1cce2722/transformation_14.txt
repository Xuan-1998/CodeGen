===BEGIN PLAN===
Instead, opt for a bottom-up approach where you tabulate the maximum points that can be earned by deleting elements from subsequences, filling in the table row by row or column by column.

Let the state be dp[i][k] which represents the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai such that the last element in the subsequence is ak.

You can initialize your table with a size of n+1 by 106, where n is the length of the sequence and 106 is the maximum possible value of an integer in the sequence.

Here are some potential issues to consider:

- What happens when k = a[i]? Should it be treated differently?
- How do you handle the cases where ak + 1 or ak - 1 do not exist in the subsequence? (e.g. i is 0)
- Can you think of any edge cases that might need special handling?

To improve your plan, I would suggest adding more details about how to fill up the dp table and what base case(s) you can use for your dynamic programming.
