===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about using dynamic programming with a 2D array to store the maximum points that can be earned after deleting k elements from a subsequence of length n.

The state expression is dp[i][k] = maximum points that can be earned after deleting k elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai.
dp[i][k] is the maximum points that can be earned by either:
    1. Deleting element ai and recursively solving for dp[i-1][k-1], or
    2. Not deleting element ai and recursively solving for dp[i-1][k].

Memoize the recursive function calls using a dictionary to store the intermediate results.

To improve this plan, we can consider:
    - Base case: When k = 0, dp[i][k] is simply the maximum points that can be earned from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai.
    - Edge cases: When i = 0 or k = n, the problem becomes trivial. For example, when k = n, we just need to return 0.
    - Memoization: Use a dictionary to store and reuse intermediate results to avoid redundant computation.

Potential issues with this plan:
    - Combinatorial explosion: If n is large, there may be too many states to compute recursively, leading to an explosion of combinations. In this case, we can use memoization to store and reuse intermediate results.
    - Incorrect base case: If the base case is not correctly handled, the DP table may not be computed correctly.

To handle edge cases:
    - When i = 0, dp[i][k] should return 0 because there are no more elements to delete.
    - When k = n, dp[i][k] should return 0 because all elements have been deleted.

Overall, this plan looks good! By using dynamic programming and memoization, we can efficiently solve this problem. Just be careful with edge cases and potential issues like combinatorial explosion.
