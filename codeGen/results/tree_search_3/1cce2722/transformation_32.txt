Your plan is correct, and it's indeed a dynamic programming problem! You're on the right track by identifying the state dp[i] that stores the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai.

One potential issue with your plan is that you haven't specified how to fill in each dp[i][k]. You need to provide a recurrence relation that calculates dp[i][k] based on dp[j][l] for some j < i and l < k. This is the key step in dynamic programming, as it allows you to break down the problem into smaller subproblems.

To improve your plan, consider adding more details about how to calculate dp[i][k]. For example, what if ai is not deleted? What if it's deleted along with all elements equal to aj + 1 and aj - 1?

As for edge cases, you should consider handling the case where n = 0 or a[1] <= 1. In these cases, the maximum number of points that can be earned is simply 0.

Overall, your plan is solid, and with some additional details on how to calculate dp[i][k], it will be even stronger!
