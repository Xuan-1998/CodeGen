===BEGIN PLAN===
Instead, opt for a bottom-up approach where you tabulate the maximum points that can be earned by deleting elements from subsequences, filling in the table row by row or column by column.

Let the state be dp[i][k] which represents the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai such that the last element in the subsequence is ak.

dp[i][k] = max(dp[i-1][j] - 1 for j in range(k+1)) if i > 0 and k > 0 else 0
You can use a 2D array dp[][] to store the maximum points that can be earned by deleting elements from subsequences, where dp[i][k] represents the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai such that the last element in the subsequence is ak.
