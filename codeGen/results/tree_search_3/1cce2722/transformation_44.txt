===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about using dynamic programming with a 2D array to store the maximum points that can be earned after deleting k elements from a subsequence of length n.

The state expression is dp[i][k] = maximum points that can be earned after deleting k elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai.
dp[i][k] is the maximum points that can be earned after deleting k elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai.

Transition relationship: 
- if ai == ak + 1 or ai == ak - 1 then delete ai and recursively solve for dp[i-1][k-1], 
- else do not delete ai and recursively solve for dp[i-1][k].

Using a 2D array to store the state of maximum points earned after deleting k elements from subsequence i, with initialization dp[0][k] = 0.

The plan is correct in terms of using dynamic programming to solve this problem. However, there are some potential issues:

* The transition relationship only considers two cases: ai == ak + 1 or ai == ak - 1. It does not consider the case where ai != ak + 1 and ai != ak - 1. This could lead to incorrect results.
* The plan does not specify what happens when k is 0. In this case, we should return dp[n-1][k] as it represents the maximum points that can be earned by deleting zero elements from the sequence.

To improve the plan:

* Add a base case for k = 0 to handle the edge case where no elements are deleted.
* Consider all possible cases in the transition relationship. For example, what if ai != ak + 1 and ai != ak - 1? In this case, we should recursively solve dp[i-1][k] as deleting ai does not affect the points earned.

The updated plan:
