===BEGIN PLAN===
Instead, opt for a bottom-up approach where you tabulate the maximum points that can be earned by deleting elements from subsequences, filling in the table row by row or column by column.

Define dp[i][0] and dp[i][i] as base cases: dp[0][k] = 0 for all k, and dp[i][i] = i for all i. The state expression can be dp[i][j].

dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of points that can be earned by deleting elements from the subsequence a[0...i] such that ak = j.

Define a helper function to calculate dp[i][j]: def calc_dp(i, j): ... and use memoization to store the results

However, there's an important consideration. When calculating dp[i][j], you should only consider subsequences where the last element is equal to j or j - 1 (or j + 1 if j is at the start of the sequence). This is because the problem statement allows for deleting elements and their neighboring elements.

To avoid redundant calculations, it's recommended to sort the sequence a in ascending order before filling up the dp table. This way, you can take advantage of the fact that subsequences with smaller last elements have been processed earlier.

Also, make sure to handle edge cases properly. For example, what if i is 0? In this case, you should return 0 as there are no points to earn.
