Your plan seems correct, but let's break it down step by step to ensure we cover all bases.

The state expression dp[i][k] is well-defined. It represents the maximum points that can be earned after deleting k elements from the subsequence a1, a2, ..., ai. This is a valid problem statement and can be solved using dynamic programming.

The plan to use tabulation with bottom-up filling up of the dp table is also correct. The dp[i][k] state depends only on the previous states dp[i-1][k-1] and dp[i-1][k], which is typical in dynamic programming problems.

To improve the plan, we should consider edge cases. For instance, what happens when k is greater than i? In this case, we would need to adjust our state expression or handle this case separately.

One potential issue with the plan is that it doesn't specify how to initialize the dp table. We will need to decide on an initial value for dp[0][k] and dp[i][0].

Another issue is that the problem statement doesn't specify if we can delete an element more than once. If not, then this should be taken into account in the state expression.

However, overall your plan looks solid. Keep it up!
