"{\"statement\": \"Task: Implement a modified version of the Quicksort algorithm that only addresses partitioning. Given an unsorted array of integers and a pivot element, partition the array into three smaller arrays based on the pivot element and return a 1-dimensional array containing each element in the first smaller array, followed by each element in the second smaller array, followed by each element in the third smaller array.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of the size of the array followed by the array elements and the pivot element. The size of the array and the pivot element are both integers. The array elements are a sequence of integers separated by spaces. The input is received from standard input.\\n\\nOutput: The output should be a space-separated list of integers. The output is printed to standard output.\\n\\nConstraints: The array size is at most $10^5$, and all elements are distinct.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Sorting']\", \"difficulties\": \"EASY\", \"source\": \"hackerrank\", \"url\": \"https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/quicksort1/problem\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"5    \\n4 5 3 7 2  \\n\", \"output\": \"3 2 4 5 7\\n\"}]}"
