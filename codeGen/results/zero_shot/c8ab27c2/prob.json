"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given two strings S and T, find the length of the shortest subsequence in S which is not a subsequence in T. If no such subsequence is possible, return -1.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of two strings S and T, each of length at most 500. The input is received from standard input.\\n\\nOutput: The output is a single integer representing the length of the shortest uncommon subsequence. The output should be printed to standard output.\\n\\nConstraints: The length of S and T is at most 500.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Dynamic programming']\", \"difficulties\": \"MEDIUM\", \"source\": \"geeksforgeeks\", \"url\": \"https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/shortest-uncommon-subsequence5746/1\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"S = \\\"babab\\\"\\r\\nT = \\\"babba\\\"\", \"output\": \"3\"}, {\"input\": \"S = \\\"babhi\\\"\\r\\nT = \\\"babij\\\"\", \"output\": \"1\"}]}"
