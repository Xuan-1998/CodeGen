Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Problem**: The problem statement clearly defines what we need to do: determine if each subsegment of the array defined by l and r is a ladder or not.

2. **Define what a Ladder is**: A ladder is a sequence of integers that first doesn't decrease, then doesn't increase. This means we can have increasing numbers at the beginning, decreasing numbers in the middle, but no increasing numbers after that.

3. **How to Solve it?**: We need to iterate through each query and for each query, check if the subsegment defined by l and r is a ladder or not. We'll do this by comparing consecutive elements in the subsegment.

4. **Code Implementation**:

Here's how you can implement this solution in Python:
