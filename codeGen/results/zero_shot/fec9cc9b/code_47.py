Let's break down the problem into smaller sub-problems:

1.  **Understand what makes a segment a ladder:** A ladder is a sequence of integers that first doesn't decrease, then doesn't increase. To check if a segment is a ladder, we need to find out whether it starts with an increasing sequence and ends with a non-decreasing sequence.

2.  **How can we check for increasing/decreasing/non-decreasing sequences?** We can do this by comparing adjacent elements in the array.

3.  **What's the most efficient way to solve this problem?** We can solve this problem by iterating over each query, and then iterating over the subsegment defined by l and r to find out whether it is a ladder or not.

4.  **How do we check for a non-decreasing/non-increasing sequence?** We can keep track of the last increasing/decreasing element and compare each subsequent element with it. If the sequence doesn't increase or decrease, then it's either non-decreasing or non-increasing.

Here is the Python code to solve this problem:
