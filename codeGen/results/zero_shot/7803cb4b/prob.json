"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given an array $a$ of length $n$, the task is to find the minimum possible length of the array that can be obtained by repeatedly replacing a pair of neighboring equal elements with one element whose value is one more than the value of the replaced elements.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer $n$ which is the length of the array. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\\\dots, a_n$ which are the initial values of the array $a$. The input is provided through standard input.\\n\\nOutput: The output is a single integer which is the minimum possible length of the array that can be obtained by performing the given operation any number of times.\\n\\nConstraints: The input array $a$ has length $n$ such that $1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 500$ and each element $a_i$ of the array satisfies $1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 1000$.\\n\\nMathematical concepts: array, integer, operation, pair, neighboring, equal, value.\\n\\nComputer science concepts: input, output, constraints, standard input.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Dynamic programming', 'Greedy algorithms']\", \"difficulties\": \"HARD\", \"source\": \"codeforces\", \"url\": \"https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1312/E\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"5\\n4 3 2 2 3\\n\", \"output\": \"2\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"7\\n3 3 4 4 4 3 3\\n\", \"output\": \"2\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"3\\n1 3 5\\n\", \"output\": \"3\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"1\\n1000\\n\", \"output\": \"1\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"15\\n67 67 65 65 66 66 66 68 67 67 67 65 65 66 70\\n\", \"output\": \"2\\n\"}]}"
