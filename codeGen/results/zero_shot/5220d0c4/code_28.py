Let's start by breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems.

1. **Understanding the problem**: The problem states that we have an array of positive integers, and a set of bad prime numbers. We need to find the maximum beauty of the array. Beauty is determined by the minimum prime divisor of each number in the array, and whether it's a good or bad prime.

2. **Identifying key concepts**:
   - Array: A collection of positive integers.
   - Bad prime numbers: These are prime numbers that we consider "bad" when calculating the beauty of the array.
   - Beauty: The beauty of an array is calculated based on its elements and whether they're good or bad primes.

3. **Identifying key operations**:
   - Finding the minimum prime divisor of each number in the array.
   - Checking if a prime number is "good" or "bad".

4. **Step-by-step approach**: We'll follow these steps to solve the problem:

    - Read the input (array size, array elements, and bad prime numbers).
    - Initialize variables to store the maximum beauty found so far and the current maximum beauty.
    - Iterate through each number in the array:
       - Calculate the minimum prime divisor of the number using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
       - Check if the minimum prime divisor is a good or bad prime. If it's a bad prime, subtract its value from the current maximum beauty. Otherwise, add its value to the current maximum beauty.
    - Keep track of the maximum beauty found so far and update it if necessary.
    - Print the maximum beauty found as the final answer.

5. **Implementing the solution**:
