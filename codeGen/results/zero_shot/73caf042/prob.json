The number of diamonds present in a room is equal to the absolute difference between the sum of even digits and sum of odd digits in its room number. The task is to find the total number of diamonds present in the grid. The input is received from standard input. The output should contain the total number of diamonds present in the grid for each test case, printed on a separate line. The constraints are 1 \\u2264 T \\u2264 10^5 and 1 \\u2264 N \\u2264 10^6.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Dynamic programming']\", \"difficulties\": \"MEDIUM_HARD\", \"source\": \"codechef\", \"url\": \"https://www.codechef.com/problems/VK18\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"3\\n1\\n2\\n3\", \"output\": \"2\\n12\\n36\"}]}"
