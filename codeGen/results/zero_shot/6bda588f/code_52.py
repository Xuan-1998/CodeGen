Let's start by breaking down the problem:

1. Understand the problem:
The goal is to find the minimum possible value of the function F, which is a combination of the given sequence of integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) and two variables (x_i, y_i) that satisfy certain conditions.

2. Identify the constraints:
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- x_i and y_i are non-negative integers that satisfy the condition x_i + y_i = a_i.
- (x_i - s) * (y_i - s) >= 0.

3. Think about how to approach this problem:
We can start by sorting the sequence of integers in descending order, since the minimum possible value of F would be obtained when we choose the largest possible values for x_i and y_i.

4. Write a Python code to solve the problem:
