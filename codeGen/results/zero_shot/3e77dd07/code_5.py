Step 1: Understand the Problem
---------------------------

The problem is asking us to determine if s2 is a scrambled string of s1. A string can be represented as a binary tree by recursively partitioning it into two non-empty substrings. To scramble a string, we can swap the children of any non-leaf node.

Step 2: Identify the Key Steps
-----------------------------

To solve this problem, we need to:

* Convert both strings into their corresponding binary trees.
* Compare these binary trees to determine if s2 is a scrambled string of s1.

Step 3: Implement the Solution
-------------------------------

Here's my solution in Python:
