Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Understand the problem: The Infinite Zoo is represented as an infinite graph with directed edges between vertices that satisfy the condition u&v=v, where & denotes the bitwise AND operation.

2. Define a query: A query represents a pair of integers (u_i, v_i) to determine whether a path exists from vertex u_i to vertex v_i in the Infinite Zoo.

3. Determine if a path exists between two vertices:

   - If there is an edge from vertex u_i to vertex v_i that satisfies the condition u&v=v, then a path exists.
   - If no such edge exists, then no path exists.

4. Implement the solution: We can use Python's built-in bitwise AND operator (&) and a dictionary to store the vertices and their connections.

Here is the code:
