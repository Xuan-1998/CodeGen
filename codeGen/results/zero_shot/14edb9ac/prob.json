"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given an undirected tree with n vertices and n-1 edges, assign each edge to a private company numbered from 1 to 10^6 such that for each vertex, the number of different companies that repair edges that have this vertex at one end does not exceed 2. The goal is to minimize the maximum number of edges assigned to a single company.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 \\u2264 n \\u2264 3000) \\u2014 the number of vertices in the tree. Next, n-1 lines follow, each containing two integers u and v (1 \\u2264 u,v \\u2264 n), indicating that there is an edge between vertices u and v. Input is provided through standard input.\\n\\nOutput: For each test case, output the minimum possible number of edges assigned to the most used company r, followed by n-1 integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n-1} (1 \\u2264 c_i \\u2264 10^6), where c_i indicates the company to repair the i-th edge. If there are multiple optimal assignments, any of them can be printed.\\n\\nConstraints: $1\\\\leq T\\\\leq 1000$; $1\\\\leq n\\\\leq 3000$; the sum of all values n for all test cases in the input does not exceed 3000.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Tree algorithms', 'Sorting', 'Dynamic programming']\", \"difficulties\": \"VERY_HARD\", \"source\": \"codeforces\", \"url\": \"https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1211/H\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"3\\n3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n6\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n1 4\\n1 5\\n1 6\\n7\\n3 1\\n1 4\\n4 6\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n1 7\\n\", \"output\": \"\\n1\\n10 20\\n3\\n1 1 1 2 2 \\n2\\n11 11 12 13 12 13\\n\"}]}"
