"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given an integer N, count the numbers having an odd number of factors from 1 to N (inclusive).\\n\\nInput: The input is a single integer N, which arrives from standard input.\\n\\nOutput: The output is a single integer representing the total count of numbers from 1 to N having an odd number of factors.\\n\\nConstraints: The input integer N is constrained to be between 0 and 10^9. The expected time complexity is O(sqrt(N)) and the expected space complexity is O(1).\\n\\nMathematical Concepts: The problem involves finding the count of numbers having an odd number of factors, which is equivalent to finding the count of perfect squares between 1 and N (inclusive). This is because a number has an odd number of factors if and only if it is a perfect square. The problem can be solved using the mathematical concept of square roots and integer division.\\n\\nComputer Science Concepts: The input is received from standard input and the output is printed to standard output. The problem can be solved using a simple loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to N and a counter variable to keep track of the count of perfect squares. The time complexity of the solution is O(N) which can be optimized to O(sqrt(N)) by iterating only up to the square root of N. The space complexity is O(1) as only a single integer variable is required to store the count of perfect squares.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Mathematics']\", \"difficulties\": \"EASY\", \"source\": \"geeksforgeeks\", \"url\": \"https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-odd-factors0844/1\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"N = 5\", \"output\": \"2\"}, {\"input\": \"N = 1\", \"output\": \"1\"}]}"
