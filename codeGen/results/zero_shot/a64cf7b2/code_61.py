**Step 1: Understand the problem**
The task is to find the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex n within a time limit of T. Each edge has a non-negative integer weight representing the time required to traverse it.

**Step 2: Identify the key components**
- The directed acyclic graph (DAG) with n vertices and m edges
- The time limit T
- The starting point is vertex 1, and the ending point is vertex n

**Step 3: Think about the problem in terms of dynamic programming**
We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We will maintain an array dp[i] that represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited if we start at vertex i within a time limit of T.

**Step 4: Code implementation**
Here is my code:
