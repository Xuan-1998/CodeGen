Let's start by breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems:

1. **Graph Representation**: Since we have a directed acyclic graph (DAG), we can represent it as an adjacency list where each node has a list of its neighbors and their corresponding weights.

2. **Topological Sorting**: The problem statement mentions that there is a directed path from vertex 1 to vertex n that can be traversed within T time units. This implies that we need to find the order in which vertices can be visited without violating any edge constraints. We can achieve this by performing a topological sort on the graph.

3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: After obtaining the topological order, we need to find the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex n within a time limit of T. This is a classic shortest path problem, and Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to solve it.

Here's a Python code that implements these steps:
