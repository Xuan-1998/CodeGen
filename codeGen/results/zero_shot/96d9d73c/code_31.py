Let's break down the problem into smaller sub-problems:

1. **Check if K is possible**: First, we need to check if it's possible to partition the array into K partitions at all. We can do this by sorting the array and then checking if the sum of the smallest (K-1) elements is less than or equal to the difference between the largest element and the K-th smallest element.

2. **Check if absolute difference is within M**: If we can partition the array into K partitions, then we need to check if the absolute difference between any pair of elements in the same partition does not exceed M. We can do this by iterating through the array and checking if the absolute difference between adjacent elements exceeds M.

Here's a Python code that implements these steps:
