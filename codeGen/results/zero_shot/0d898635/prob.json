"{\"statement\": \"Task: Implement a memoization solution for the Fibonacci sequence algorithm. The memoized version should keep a cache data structure to store the Fibonacci numbers as they are calculated, avoiding the deficiencies of tree recursion. Refactor the function into a recursive Fibonacci function that uses the memoized data structure and keeps the cache private to the function.\\n\\nInput: The input for the problem is not relevant as it is not used in the implementation. The input arrives from standard input.\\n\\nOutput: There is no output required for this problem.\\n\\nConstraints: There are no input constraints for this problem.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Dynamic programming']\", \"difficulties\": \"EASY\", \"source\": \"codewars\", \"url\": \"https://www.codewars.com/kata/529adbf7533b761c560004e5\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": [70], \"output\": [190392490709135]}, {\"input\": [60], \"output\": [1548008755920]}, {\"input\": [50], \"output\": [12586269025]}]}"
