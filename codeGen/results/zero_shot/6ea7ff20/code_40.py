Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The given permutation p of length 2n is the concatenation of two arrays a and b, each of length n.

   * We will find out if there exist such arrays a and b with no elements in common, so that p=merge(a,b).

2. To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach by sorting the given permutation p. Then, we will iterate over the sorted array p to construct the two arrays a and b.

3. We need to check if there are any duplicate elements in the permutation p. If there are no duplicates, then it means that we have found such arrays a and b with no common elements, so that p=merge(a,b).

4. If there are some duplicate elements, we can't guarantee that there exist such arrays a and b. In this case, we need to output "NO".

Here is the Python code for the above approach:
