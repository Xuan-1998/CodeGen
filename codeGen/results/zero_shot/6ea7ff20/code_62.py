This code defines the merge function and a check function to verify if there exist arrays a and b that satisfy the given condition. The main part of the program reads the test cases, calls the check function for each case, and prints the result.

Note: This solution assumes that the input permutation p is valid, i.e., it can be divided into two non-empty arrays a and b of length n. If this assumption does not hold (i.e., if p contains duplicate elements or its length is not even), the solution may produce incorrect results.
