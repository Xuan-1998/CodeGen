"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given a list of juices, each with a price and a set of vitamins it contains, find the minimum total price of a subset of juices that contains all three types of vitamins.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of an integer $n$ representing the number of juices, followed by $n$ lines each containing an integer $c_i$ and a string $s_i$ representing the price and vitamin content of the $i$-th juice. The string $s_i$ contains from $1$ to $3$ characters, and the only possible characters are \\\"A\\\", \\\"B\\\" and \\\"C\\\". It is guaranteed that each letter appears no more than once in each string $s_i$. The input is provided through standard input.\\n\\nOutput: The output is either -1 if it is impossible to obtain all three vitamins, or the minimum total price of juices that contain all three types of vitamins.\\n\\nConstraints: $1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 1,000$, $1 \\\\leq c_i \\\\leq 100,000$. We can represent each juice as a tuple $(c_i, S_i)$, where $S_i$ is a set containing the vitamins in the $i$-th juice. We can represent the set of all juices as $J = \\\\{(c_i, S_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$. We want to find the minimum total price of a subset $J' \\\\subseteq J$ such that $A \\\\in \\\\bigcup_{(c,S) \\\\in J'} S$, $B \\\\in \\\\bigcup_{(c,S) \\\\in J'} S$, and $C \\\\in \\\\bigcup_{(c,S) \\\\in J'} S$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are the sets containing the vitamin \\\"A\\\", \\\"B\\\", and \\\"C\\\", respectively. We can represent the set of all vitamins as $V = \\\\{A, B, C\\\\}$. We want to find the minimum total price of a subset $J' \\\\subseteq J$ such that $\\\\bigcup_{(c,S) \\\\in J'} S \\\\supseteq V$.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Dynamic programming', 'Bit manipulation', 'Implementation', 'Complete search']\", \"difficulties\": \"EASY\", \"source\": \"codeforces\", \"url\": \"https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1042/B\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"4\\n5 C\\n6 B\\n16 BAC\\n4 A\\n\", \"output\": \"15\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"2\\n10 AB\\n15 BA\\n\", \"output\": \"-1\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"5\\n10 A\\n9 BC\\n11 CA\\n4 A\\n5 B\\n\", \"output\": \"13\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"6\\n100 A\\n355 BCA\\n150 BC\\n160 AC\\n180 B\\n190 CA\\n\", \"output\": \"250\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"2\\n5 BA\\n11 CB\\n\", \"output\": \"16\\n\"}]}"
