Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the problem statement
The problem asks us to find the lexicographically smallest string of length exactly k that can be obtained by either deleting the last character of the string or duplicating the string.

Step 2: Define variables and read input from stdin
We'll define two variables n and k to represent the length of the original string s and the desired string, respectively. We'll then read these values from stdin using Python's built-in functions.

Step 3: Read the original string s from stdin
We'll read the original string s consisting of lowercase English letters from stdin.

Step 4: Check if k is greater than or equal to n
If k is greater than or equal to n, it means we need to duplicate the string. In this case, we simply return the original string repeated k // n times.

Step 5: Check if k is less than n
If k is less than n, it means we can delete characters from the end of the string. We'll iterate over the last k characters of the string and find the lexicographically smallest substring of length k.

Step 6: Return the result
Finally, we'll return the result as our answer to stdout.

Here's the complete Python code:
