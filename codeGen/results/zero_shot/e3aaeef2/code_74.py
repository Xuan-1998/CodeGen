Let's break down the problem into smaller sub-problems:

1. **Understanding the problem**: The problem is asking us to apply m operations to an integer n, where each operation replaces every digit d of the number with the decimal representation of integer d + 1. We need to find the length of n after applying m operations and print it modulo 10^9+7.

2. **Identifying the pattern**: Let's analyze the operations applied to the digits. Each operation increases the digit by 1, which means that each digit will eventually become 9. When a digit becomes 9, it wraps around to 0. This is a circular shift of 1 unit to the right.

3. **Applying the operations**: To apply m operations, we can simulate the circular shift m times. We'll start with n and after each operation, we'll update n by shifting its digits to the right.

4. **Calculating the length**: After applying m operations, we need to calculate the length of the resulting number. Since the maximum value that a digit can hold is 9, the maximum possible length is the number of times we can fit 9 in n (considering the circular shift).

5. **Handling overflow**: As the result may be very large, we'll use modulo operation to keep it within bounds.

Here's the Python code to implement this:
