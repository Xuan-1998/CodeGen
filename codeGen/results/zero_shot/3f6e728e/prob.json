"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given N upper hemispheres and M lower hemispheres, each with a radius between 1 and C, find the number of different X-sequences that can be built. An X-sequence is a sequence of nested concentric spheres, and the number of different X-sequences is determined by the number of spheres of different radii available.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of T test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing three integers: N, M, and C. The second line contains N space-separated integers U_1, U_2, ..., U_N denoting the radii of the upper hemispheres, and the third line contains M space-separated integers L_1, L_2, ..., L_M denoting the radii of the lower hemispheres. The input is provided through standard input.\\n\\nOutput: For each test case, output a single line containing C space-separated integers, where the i-th integer represents the number of ways there are to build an i-sequence in modulo 10^9+7.\\n\\nConstraints: 1 \\u2264 N \\u2264 10^5, 1 \\u2264 M \\u2264 10^5, 1 \\u2264 C \\u2264 10^3, 1 \\u2264 U_i \\u2264 C, 1 \\u2264 L_i \\u2264 C, 1 \\u2264 T \\u2264 20.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Dynamic programming']\", \"difficulties\": \"MEDIUM_HARD\", \"source\": \"codechef\", \"url\": \"https://www.codechef.com/problems/KSPHERES\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"3 4 3\\n1 2 3\\n1 1 3 2\", \"output\": \"5 2 0\"}]}"
