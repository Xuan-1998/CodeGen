Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. First, we need to understand the structure of the directed tree. Since it's a tree, there are no cycles (i.e., a path that starts and ends at the same city). We can assume that all cities are connected to the capital in one direction.

2. Next, we need to define what we mean by "reversing" an edge. When we say "reverse" an edge (si, ti), it means we make a new edge from city ti to city si. In other words, we change the orientation of the edge from pointing from si to ti to pointing from ti to si.

3. Now, let's define what it means for a city to be reachable from another city. A city is reachable if there exists a path that starts at the capital and ends at this city. Since we're given a tree, all cities are reachable from the capital.

4. Finally, our goal is to minimize the number of edges that need to be reversed in order for every other city to be reachable from the chosen capital.

Here's a Python solution:
