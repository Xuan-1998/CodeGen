Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem is about performing exactly k moves on an array of positive integers, where each move can be either to the left or right. A maximum score can be achieved if we take a combination of these two types of moves.

Step 2: Determine the constraints
The constraint that no more than z moves can be taken to the left means that we should always try to take as many moves to the right as possible, and then adjust by taking at most z moves to the left. This will help us maximize our score.

Step 3: Analyze the array
The array is an increasing sequence of positive integers. Since we can't decrease our score by moving to a smaller value, it makes sense to always try to move to the right as much as possible.

Step 4: Develop a strategy
One approach could be to first calculate how many moves we can take to the right. Then, if necessary, adjust this number by taking at most z moves to the left.

Here's the Python code for the solution:
