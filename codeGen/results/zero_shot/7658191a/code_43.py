Let's break down the problem into smaller sub-problems:

1. Understand the rules of the game:
	* We can move exactly k times, with no more than z moves to the left and no two or more moves to the left in a row.
	* A move can either be to the right, adding the value at the next index to the score, or to the left, adding the value at the previous index to the score.

2. Define what is our goal:
	* Find the maximum score that can be achieved.

3. Think about the possible ways we can achieve this:
	* We can start by considering a simple approach: always move right.
	* But then we realize that we might need to adjust our strategy based on the values in the array and the number of moves available (k, z).

4. Let's think about some possible scenarios:
	* If k is very large, it seems like we should just keep moving right and adding up all the values.
	* But if k is small, we might need to adjust our strategy based on the values in the array.

5. Now let's start coding:
