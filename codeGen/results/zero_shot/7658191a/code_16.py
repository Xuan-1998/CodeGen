# Let's start with the basics:

# The problem is asking us to find the maximum score that can be achieved after k moves
# We need to consider two constraints: 
# 1. No more than z moves to the left in a row (so we can't have consecutive moves to the left)
# 2. No move to the left if there's no way to get a higher score by doing so

# Let's start by thinking about what kind of information we need to keep track of
# We'll need to know the maximum score that can be achieved after each possible number of moves
# We'll also need to know whether it's possible to achieve a higher score by moving left at each position

# This is a classic problem of dynamic programming!
