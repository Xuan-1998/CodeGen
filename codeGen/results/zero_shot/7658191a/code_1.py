# Step 1: Understand the Problem
The problem is asking you to find the maximum score that can be achieved by making exactly k moves, with no more than z moves to the left and no two or more moves to the left in a row. 

# Step 2: Break down the Moves into Two Cases - Right and Left
We can break down the moves into two cases:
- Right Move: Adding the value at the next index to the score.
- Left Move: Adding the value at the previous index to the score.

# Step 3: Calculate the Maximum Score for Each Case
For each case, we need to calculate the maximum score that can be achieved. 

# Step 4: Combine the Scores from Both Cases
We combine the scores from both cases and find the maximum of the two.

Here's a Python code implementing this solution:
