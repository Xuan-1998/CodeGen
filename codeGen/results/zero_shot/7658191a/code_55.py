This code should be able to solve the problem given the constraints. It first calculates the maximum score for k - 2 moves to the left and then adds the value of the last array element to this score. The result is printed as the maximum score that can be achieved.

Please note that this solution assumes that we are not allowed to make more than one move to the left in a row, which means that we have to alternate between making moves to the left and right.
