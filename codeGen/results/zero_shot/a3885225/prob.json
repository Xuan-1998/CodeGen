"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given a binary string S of length N, determine whether it is possible to convert S to a palindrome by flipping pairs of its characters.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer N, the length of the binary string S. The second line contains a binary string S of length N containing 0s and 1s only. The input is provided through standard input.\\n\\nOutput: For each test case, output YES if it is possible to convert S to a palindrome by flipping pairs of its characters. Otherwise, output NO. The output should be printed to standard output.\\n\\nConstraints: There can be at most $10^5$ test cases, and each binary string S can have a length of at most $10^5$. The sum of the lengths of all binary strings over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\\\cdot 10^5$.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Constructive algorithms', 'Ad-hoc']\", \"difficulties\": \"EASY\", \"source\": \"codechef\", \"url\": \"https://www.codechef.com/problems/FLIPPAL\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"3\\n6\\n101011\\n2\\n01\\n7\\n1110000\\n\", \"output\": \"YES\\nNO\\nYES\\n\"}]}"
