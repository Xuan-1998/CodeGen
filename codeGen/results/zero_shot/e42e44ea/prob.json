"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given an M x N grid, where each cell has an integer representing points, find the minimum initial points required to reach the bottom-right cell from the top-left cell, following certain rules. The rules are: \\n1. Movement is only allowed to the right or down.\\n2. Movement is only allowed through cells with positive points.\\n3. The final cell must be reached with minimum positive points.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of three integers: N, M, and a 2D array of size N x M representing the grid. The input is provided through standard input.\\n\\nOutput: The output is a single integer representing the minimum initial points required to reach the destination cell with minimum positive points.\\n\\nConstraints: N is between 1 and 1000, each cell in the grid can have a value between -10^9 and 10^9.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Dynamic programming']\", \"difficulties\": \"MEDIUM_HARD\", \"source\": \"geeksforgeeks\", \"url\": \"https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-points-to-reach-destination0540/1\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"M = 3, N = 3 \\n       arr[][] = {{-2,-3,3}, \\n                  {-5,-10,1}, \\n                  {10,30,-5}};\", \"output\": \"7\"}, {\"input\": \"M = 3, N = 2\\n       arr[][] = {{2,3}, \\n                  {5,10}, \\n                  {10,30}};\", \"output\": \"1\"}]}"
