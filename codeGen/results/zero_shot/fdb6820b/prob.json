"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given a set of m distinct positive integers and a value \\u2018N\\u2019, count the total number of ways we can form \\u2018N\\u2019 by adding the array elements. Repetitions and different arrangements are allowed. Output the answer modulo 10^{9}+7.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of three integers: m, N, and an array of m distinct positive integers. The input is read from standard input. The integers m and N are constrained by 1 <= m,N <= 10^3.\\n\\nOutput: The output should be a single integer representing the total number of ways to form N by adding the elements of the array. The output should be printed to standard output.\\n\\nConstraints: The integers m and N are constrained by 1 <= m,N <= 10^3.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Dynamic programming']\", \"difficulties\": \"MEDIUM\", \"source\": \"geeksforgeeks\", \"url\": \"https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/ways-to-sum-to-n5759/1\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"m = 3 , N = 7\\nArr[] = {1,5,6}\", \"output\": \"6\"}, {\"input\": \"m = 3 , N = 3\\nArr[] = {1,2,3}\", \"output\": \"4\"}]}"
