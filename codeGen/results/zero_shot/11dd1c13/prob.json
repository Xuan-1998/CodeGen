"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given a square grid of integers, find the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts. A falling path is a choice of one element from each row of the grid, such that no two elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of a square grid of integers, where each row has the same number of elements. The input is provided through standard input.\\n\\nOutput: The output is a single integer, which represents the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts.\\n\\nConstraints: The length of each row of the grid is between 1 and 200, and each element of the grid is an integer between -99 and 99.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Matrices', 'Dynamic programming', 'Data structures']\", \"difficulties\": \"MEDIUM\", \"source\": \"leetcode\", \"url\": \"https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-falling-path-sum-ii/\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": [[[1, 2, 3], [6, 6, 7], [7, 8, 9], [], []]], \"output\": 13}]}"
