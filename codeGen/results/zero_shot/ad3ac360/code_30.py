Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the problem**: We are given a string of length n, and we need to find the minimum number of cuts required to partition the string into palindromic substrings.

2. **Create a function for checking if a substring is palindrome or not**: We can create a helper function that takes a substring as input and checks if it's a palindrome or not.

3. **Main logic**: Iterate over each character in the given string, and for each character, check all possible substrings starting from that character (both to the left and right). If any of these substrings is palindrome, add 1 to our count.

4. **Print the result**: After iterating over all characters, print the minimum number of cuts required as our answer.

Here's a Python solution implementing this approach:
