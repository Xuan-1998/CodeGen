Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Define the problem statement clearly.

Given a string of length n, determine the minimum number of cuts required to partition the string into palindromic substrings.

Step 2: Identify the input and output format.

Input: A single string of length n provided through standard input.
Output: A single integer representing the minimum number of cuts needed for palindrome partitioning of the given string.

Step 3: Understand the constraints. In this case, the input string has a length between 1 and 500, inclusive.

Step 4: Think about how we can approach this problem. One way is to use dynamic programming. We can create a table where each cell represents whether the substring from the start of the string up to that point is a palindrome or not. If it's a palindrome, then there's no need for a cut at that position.

Step 5: Implement the solution in Python. Here's how we could do it:
