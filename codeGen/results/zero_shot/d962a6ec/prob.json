"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given a regular polygon with $n$ vertices labeled from $1$ to $n$ in counter-clockwise order, find the minimum weight among all possible triangulations of the polygon. The weight of a triangulation is the sum of weights of the triangles it consists of, where the weight of a triangle is the product of labels of its vertices.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of a single integer $n$ representing the number of vertices in the regular polygon. The input is provided through standard input.\\n\\nOutput: The output should be a single integer representing the minimum weight among all possible triangulations of the given polygon.\\n\\nConstraints: $3 \\\\le n \\\\le 500$.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Dynamic programming', 'Mathematics', 'Greedy algorithms']\", \"difficulties\": \"EASY\", \"source\": \"codeforces\", \"url\": \"https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1140/D\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"3\\n\", \"output\": \"6\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"4\\n\", \"output\": \"18\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"5\\n\", \"output\": \"38\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"6\\n\", \"output\": \"68\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"7\\n\", \"output\": \"110\\n\"}]}"
