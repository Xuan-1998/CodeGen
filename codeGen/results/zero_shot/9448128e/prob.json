"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given $N$ sets of integers, find the number of ways to choose a sequence of integers from each set such that no two adjacent elements in the sequence are equal. The output should be the count of such sequences modulo $998,244,353$.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of an integer $N$ followed by $N$ lines, where each line contains an integer $|A_i|$ followed by $|A_i|$ space-separated integers representing the elements of the set $A_i$. The input is provided through standard input.\\n\\nOutput: A single integer representing the number of valid sequences, modulo $998,244,353$.\\n\\nConstraints: $2 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 200,000$, $|A_i| \\\\geq 1$ for each $i$, $\\\\sum_{i=1}^N |A_i| \\\\leq 200,000$, and $1 \\\\leq c_{i,j} \\\\leq 200,000$ for each $i,j$.
