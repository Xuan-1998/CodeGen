1. Understand the problem:
The problem is about determining whether a given sequence b can be obtained from another sequence a by splitting a into segments and writing the length of each segment to the left or right of it.

2. Identify the constraints:
- The size of the sequence n does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- Each element in the sequence b_i is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).

3. Think about how to solve the problem:
One approach could be to iterate over each element in the sequence b, and for each element, check if it can be obtained from a segment of sequence a. This would involve checking if there exists a segment of length equal to the current element in the sequence b.

4. Implement the solution in Python:
Here's an example implementation:
