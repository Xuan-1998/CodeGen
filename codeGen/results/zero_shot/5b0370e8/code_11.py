# Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem is asking us to find the number of arrays that satisfy the condition: bitwise AND operation on all elements is greater than or equal to the result of the bitwise XOR operation on all elements.

# Step 2: Identify the key observations
- The bitwise AND operation will always produce a value less than or equal to $2^k - 1$.
- The bitwise XOR operation will always produce a value that can be at most $2^k - 1$ (because there are no more than $2^k - 1$ ones in the array).
- We only need to consider arrays where all elements are less than $2^k$.

# Step 3: Count the arrays
We can count the arrays that satisfy the condition by using a prefix sum approach. For each possible bitwise AND and XOR values, we can calculate how many arrays there are that produce this value.

# Step 4: Code the solution
Here is the Python code for the problem:
