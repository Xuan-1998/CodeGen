To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller sub-problems.

1.  First, we need to understand the bitwise AND (bitwise &amp; operator) and bitwise XOR (&#x25;^&#x25; operator). The bitwise &amp; operator compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0. The bitwise &#x25;^&#x25; operator compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1.

2.  Let's focus on finding the bitwise AND and bitwise XOR values for a given array of integers. To calculate the bitwise AND value, we need to find the maximum possible number that can be obtained by performing a bitwise &amp; operation on all elements in the array. Similarly, to calculate the bitwise XOR value, we need to find the maximum possible number that can be obtained by performing a bitwise &#x25;^&#x25; operation on all elements in the array.

3.  Now let's think about how many arrays satisfy the condition. For an array to satisfy the condition, it must have at least one element with its k-th bit set to 1 for the bitwise AND value to be greater than or equal to the bitwise XOR value. This is because if all elements in the array are less than $2^k$, then the bitwise AND value will always be less than the bitwise XOR value.

4.  Therefore, we just need to count the number of ways we can choose at least one element with its k-th bit set to 1 and subtract that from the total number of arrays. This is because if we don't have any elements with their k-th bits set to 1, then all bitwise AND values will be less than bitwise XOR values.

5.  The total number of arrays can be calculated using combinatorics (the number of ways to choose n items out of a total of $2^k$). The number of arrays without any elements with their k-th bits set to 1 is the same as the total number minus the number of ways to choose at least one element.

6.  Finally, we need to take the count modulo $10^9+7$. This is because the problem asks for the count modulo $10^9+7$.

Here's a Python code that implements this solution:
