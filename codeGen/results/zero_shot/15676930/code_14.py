Let's break down the problem into smaller sub-problems:

1. First, we need to understand how the joy value of each hare depends on its adjacent hares. We can see that:
   - If both adjacent hares are hungry (a_i), then the joy value is a_i.
   - If one of the adjacent hares is full and the other is hungry, then the joy value is b_i.
   - If both adjacent hares are full (c_i), then the joy value is c_i.

2. Now, we need to determine the maximum possible total joy of the hares. We can do this by feeding the hares in a way that maximizes their combined joy. This means we should feed those hares first that have the highest joy values when both adjacent hares are hungry (a_i).

3. After feeding all the hares with high a_i, we need to reorder the remaining hares so that they give us the maximum possible total joy. Since there might be some hares with b_i or c_i left, we should feed those next in such a way that maximizes their combined joy.

4. The final step is to sort the remaining hares based on their corresponding b_i and c_i values. We can do this by feeding those hares first that have the highest values for both b_i and c_i.

Here's a Python solution that implements these steps:
