Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Generate all numbers from 0 to 10^n - 1, where each number is padded with leading zeroes to have length n.

Step 2: Iterate over these numbers and check for blocks of equal digits. A block is a consecutive segment of equal digits that cannot be extended to the left or to the right.

Step 3: Count the number of blocks of each length.

Here's a Python solution:
