Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. Understand the problem:
   The task is to count the number of blocks of each length in a list of integers from 0 to 10^n - 1, where each integer is padded with leading zeroes to have length n. A block is a consecutive segment of equal digits that cannot be extended to the left or to the right.

2. Generate all numbers from 0 to 10^n - 1:
   This can be achieved by generating all possible combinations of n digits (0-9) and padding them with leading zeroes if necessary.

3. Count the blocks of each length:
   For each number, iterate over its digits and check for consecutive equal digits. If found, increment the count for that block length.

4. Calculate the total count modulo 998244353:
   After counting all blocks, calculate the total count for each block length and take the result modulo 998244353 to satisfy the constraint.

Here is a Python solution implementing these steps:
