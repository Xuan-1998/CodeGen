Determine the optimal substructure by defining a dynamic programming table where each cell represents whether a given substring is palindromic.

Define dp[i][j] as 1 if s[i..j] can be partitioned into two palindromes and one separator character, and 0 otherwise. This will help in identifying the minimum number of cuts required for palindrome partitioning.

Initialize the table by setting dp[i][i] to 1 for all i, since a single-character substring is always a palindrome.

Fill in the table using bottom-up tabulation:

For j = n-2 downto 0:
    For i = 0 to n-j-1:
        if s[i] == s[j+i+1] (i.e., the first and last characters of the current substring are the same):
            dp[i][j] = 1
        else:
            min_cuts = j-i
            for k = i to j:
                if dp[i][k-1] && dp[k+1][j]:
                    min_cuts = min(min_cuts, k - i + 1)
            dp[i][j] = min_cuts

Return the value of dp[0][n-1], which represents the minimum number of cuts required for palindrome partitioning.
