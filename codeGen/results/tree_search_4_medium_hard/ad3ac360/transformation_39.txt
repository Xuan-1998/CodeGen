===BEGIN PLAN===
Define a recursive function that checks if a substring is a palindrome. Since it has overlapping subproblems, consider using memoization to store the results of expensive function calls and avoid redundant computation.

Is there a clear base case for determining if a single character is a palindrome? Yes, since a single character is always a palindrome.

Create a state variable representing the minimum number of cuts required to reach each prefix of the string. The transition relationship could be: 
for each character, check if it's the same as the corresponding character from the end of the string (for palindrome check). If not, increment the cut count and update the DP table accordingly.

Implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by iterating over the string and updating a 2D table. Start with a subproblem where the prefix is empty and update the DP table row by row.
