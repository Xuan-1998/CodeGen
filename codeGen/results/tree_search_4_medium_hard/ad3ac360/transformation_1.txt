===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a recursive function that checks if a substring is a palindrome, then use memoization to store the results of expensive function calls.

State: dp[i] represents whether the last cut at position i resulted in a palindrome partition.

Consider the states dp[i][j] as a boolean indicating if the substring from index i to j is a palindrome.

Memoize the recursive function that checks if a substring is a palindrome and store the results in a dictionary.

When determining dp[i], consider all possible cuts at positions 0 to i-1, and for each cut, check if the remaining string (from i+1 to n) is a palindrome. If it is, then update dp[i] accordingly.

The base case for the recursion would be when the substring length is less than or equal to 2, in which case it's always a palindrome.

To further improve the plan:

* Use dynamic programming to store and reuse previously computed results, reducing the time complexity.
* Consider using a more efficient algorithm for checking if a string is a palindrome, such as Manacher's Algorithm.
* When determining dp[i], consider all possible cuts at positions 0 to i-1 and not just the first cut. This would ensure that we find the optimal number of cuts.

The plan should handle edge cases such as an empty input string or a single character input string.
