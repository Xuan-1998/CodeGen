===BEGIN PLAN===
Define a boolean array dp where dp[i] represents whether the substring from index 0 to i can be palindrome-partitioned into smaller palindromic substrings.

Create a dynamic programming table with rows representing indices and columns representing whether the substring can be palindrome-partitioned. The state expression captures all possible substrings of the input string because we are considering each character as the starting point for a potential palindrome, allowing us to cover all possible substrings.

For each index i, check if the current character is equal to itself (ignoring case). If it is, then update dp[i] to true. This is because a single character is always considered a palindrome. Then, iterate from left to right and check for palindromes with increasing lengths by considering the characters on both sides of the current character.

If at any point we find that the substring is not a palindrome, set dp[i] to false. If we can successfully partition the entire string into smaller palindromic substrings without cutting it, then return 0 as the minimum number of cuts. Otherwise, continue updating the dynamic programming table and eventually return the minimum number of cuts needed.
