===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a recursive function that checks if a substring is a palindrome, then use memoization to store the results of expensive function calls.

State: dp[i] represents whether the last cut at position i resulted in a palindrome partition.

Define the transition relationship as:
dp[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j]) and ((i - 1 >= 0) and dp[i-1][j-1]) or (j + 1 < n) and dp[i+1][j+1]),
where s is the input string.

Implement memoization by passing the result of the recursive function as an argument and storing it in a dictionary, ensuring that each substring is only checked once. Use a dictionary to store the results of expensive function calls.
Consider using a bottom-up approach instead of a top-down approach for better performance.
For edge cases, consider handling strings of length 1 and empty strings separately.
