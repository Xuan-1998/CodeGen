===BEGIN PLAN===
Define a 2D table dp where each entry dp[i][j] represents whether the substring from index i to j is a palindrome or not.

The state expression can be defined as (i, j) representing the left and right boundaries of the current substring being considered.

The transition relationships can be formulated based on checking if the characters at the center of the substring are equal to themselves (ignoring case) for even-length substrings, or checking if the characters at both ends are equal to themselves (ignoring case) for odd-length substrings.

Implement dynamic programming using a 1D table where each entry represents the minimum number of cuts required for palindrome partitioning up to that point in the string. Start by initializing dp[0][n-1] = 0, as there is no need for cuts if the entire string is a palindrome.

For each pair (i, j) such that i <= j and 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < n:

* If the substring from index i to j is a palindrome, then dp[i][j] = 0.
* Otherwise, consider cutting at every position k in the range [i, j]. The minimum number of cuts required for palindrome partitioning up to that point in the string would be the minimum of:
	+ 1 + dp[i][k-1] + dp[k+1][j], if the substring from index i to k is a palindrome and the substring from index k+1 to j is also a palindrome.
	+ 1 + min(dp[i][k-1]) for all k in [i, j], where we cut at position k.

Finally, return dp[0][n-1] as the minimum number of cuts required for palindrome partitioning of the given string.
