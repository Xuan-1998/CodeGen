===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the optimal substructure by defining a dynamic programming table where each cell represents whether a given substring is palindromic.
Then, use bottom-up tabulation to fill in the table and compute the minimum number of cuts.

Let dp[i][j] represent whether the substring s[i..j] can be partitioned into two palindromes with at most one separator character between them. Initialize dp as a 2D array filled with zeros, where dp[i][j] = 0 for all i and j.

For each cell dp[i][j], consider all possible cuts that can be made within the substring s[i..j]. If there's no cut, then check if the entire substring is palindromic. If it is, set dp[i][j] to 1. This represents the base case of our dynamic programming.

Now, for each cell, iterate over all possible cuts and check if the remaining two substrings can be partitioned into palindromes with at most one separator character between them. If they can, then this cut is valid, so set dp[i][j] to 1. This represents the recursive case of our dynamic programming.

Finally, compute the minimum number of cuts by iterating over the table in reverse order and finding the first cell where dp[i][j] = 0. The number of cuts before that cell represents the minimum number of cuts needed for palindrome partitioning of the given string.
