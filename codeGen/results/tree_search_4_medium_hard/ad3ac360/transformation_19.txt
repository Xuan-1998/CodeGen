===BEGIN PLAN===
Define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring from index i to j is palindromic.
Initialize dp with all False values except for dp[0][0] which is True, since an empty string is considered palindromic.
For each character in the input string:
    For each possible cut position:
        Check if the current substring is a palindrome by checking whether its first and last characters match and the characters in between are the same when reversed (ignoring the current character).
            If it's a palindrome, mark dp[i][j] as True.
        Recursively call the function on the remaining substring to check if the remaining part can be partitioned into palindromes.
    Update the minimum number of cuts needed by checking how many True values are in the current row of dp.
