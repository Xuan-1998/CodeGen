===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the optimal substructure by defining a dynamic programming table where each cell represents whether a given substring is palindromic. Then, use bottom-up tabulation to fill in the table and compute the minimum number of cuts.

Define dp[i][j] as 1 if s[i..j] can be cut into two palindromes with at most one separator character between them, and 0 otherwise.

Create a dynamic programming table where each cell represents whether a given substring is palindromic or not. Initialize the base cases: dp[i][i] = 1 for all i (a single character is always a palindrome).

For each substring s[i..j], check if it's a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends towards the center. If it's a palindrome, mark dp[i][j] as 1.

Now, consider the case where s[i..j] cannot be cut into two palindromes with at most one separator character between them. This means that either:

- The substring is not a palindrome, so dp[i][j] remains 0.
- The substring can be cut into two palindromes but with more than one separator character, which would require more cuts than the minimum.

To determine the minimum number of cuts, iterate through the dynamic programming table and count the number of cells marked as 1. This represents the minimum number of cuts required to partition the string into palindromic substrings.

Finally, return the total count of 1's in the dp table.
