===BEGIN PLAN===
Define a recursive function that checks if a substring is a palindrome. Since it has overlapping subproblems, consider using memoization to store the results of expensive function calls and avoid redundant computation.

Consider defining a dynamic programming state where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring from index i to j is palindromic.

Use a dictionary to store the memoized results of the recursive function. This will allow you to avoid recalculating the same palindrome checks multiple times.

To improve the plan, consider using bottom-up dynamic programming instead of top-down recursion. This can be done by initializing the dp array with all False values and then updating each cell based on its neighbors' values.

To ensure that the plan handles edge cases correctly, make sure to handle the base case where i is equal to j (i.e., checking if a single character is a palindrome).
