===BEGIN PLAN===
Define a dynamic programming table dp with n+1 rows and n+1 columns, where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring from i to j is palindromic.

Define a recursive function is_palindrome(i, j) that checks if the substring from i to j is a palindrome. If the current character at index k is not equal to the character at index n-k-1 (where n is the length of the string), then return False; otherwise, recursively check if the substring without the middle characters is palindromic.

For each character in the string, update the dp table accordingly based on whether the substring ending at that character is palindromic or not. If it's palindromic, mark all substrings with that as their end point as also being palindromic.

Initialize a variable min_cuts to n-1 (the maximum number of cuts), and then iterate over the dp table from top to bottom and left to right. For each cell, if the value is True, update min_cuts accordingly based on whether the current substring is palindromic or not.

At the end of the plan, return min_cuts as the minimum number of cuts required for palindrome partitioning.
