===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the optimal substructure by defining a dynamic programming table where each cell represents whether a given substring is palindromic.

Initialize a 2D table dp of size n x n, where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring s[i..j] is palindromic.
Fill in the table using a bottom-up approach:
    For i from 0 to n-1, and j from i to n-1,
        If s[i] == s[j] and j - i <= 2, then dp[i][j] = 1 (since single characters or substrings of length 2 are always palindromes)
        Else if i + 1 >= j, then dp[i][j] = 0 (since empty substring is not a palindrome)
        Else
            For k from i to j-1,
                If s[k] == s[j-k+1], then dp[i][j] = dp[i][k-1] && dp[k+1][j] (since the substring can be cut into two palindromes with at most one separator character)
                Else break
            End for
        End if

Compute the minimum number of cuts:
    Initialize a variable min_cuts to 0
    For i from 0 to n-1, and j from i to n-1,
        If dp[i][j] == 0 then increment min_cuts by 1 (since we need at least one cut for this substring)

Return the minimum number of cuts as the result.
