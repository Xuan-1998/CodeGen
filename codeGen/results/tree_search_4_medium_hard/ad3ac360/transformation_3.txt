===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a recursive function that checks if a substring is a palindrome, then use memoization to store the results of expensive function calls.

State: dp[i] represents whether the last cut at position i resulted in a palindrome partition.

Define the transition relationship as:

dp[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j]) and ((i - 1 >= 0) and dp[i-1][j-1]) or (j + 1 < n) and dp[i+1][j+1])

where s is the input string.

Use a dictionary to store the results of expensive function calls, mapping each substring to a boolean value indicating whether it's a palindrome.

For initialization: dp[0][n-1] = True, as an empty string is considered a palindrome. For all other positions, initialize dp[i][j] = False.

Transition rules:
If s[i] == s[j], then consider two subcases:
	* If the substring from i to j-1 (inclusive) is a palindrome, and so is the substring from i+1 to j (inclusive), then it's also a palindrome.
	* Else, if one of these substrings is not a palindrome, then this substring is not a palindrome either.

If s[i] != s[j], then consider two subcases:
	* If the substring from i-1 to j (inclusive) is a palindrome, and so is the substring from i+1 to n-1, then it's also a palindrome.
	* Else, if one of these substrings is not a palindrome, then this substring is not a palindrome either.

Calculate dp[i][j] based on these rules. Then, calculate the minimum number of cuts needed by iterating through the string and considering all possible cuts at each position.

The answer will be the smallest integer k such that s[:k+1] and s[k+1:] are both palindromes.
