===BEGIN PLAN===
Define a recursive function that checks if a substring is a palindrome. Since it has overlapping subproblems, consider using memoization to store the results of expensive function calls and avoid redundant computation.

Is there a clear base case for determining if a single character is a palindrome? Yes, the answer is True since a single character is always palindromic.

Define three states: 
1) Whether the current substring is palindromic (dp)
2) The dynamic programming table for the previous recursive call (prev_dp)
3) The minimum number of cuts needed to partition the string into palindrome substrings (min_cuts)

The transition relationship could be:
- If the current substring is palindromic, then update dp accordingly. 
- If not, backtrack to find the optimal partitioning by considering all possible cuts and updating min_cuts and prev_dp.
- The base case would be when the length of the string becomes 1, in which case the minimum number of cuts needed is 0.

Implement memoization using a decorator function that caches the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result if the function is called again with the same arguments.
