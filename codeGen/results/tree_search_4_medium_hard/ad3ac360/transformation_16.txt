===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming table dp[][] where each cell represents whether a given substring is palindromic
dp[i][j] = 1 if s[i..j] can be partitioned into two palindromes and one separator character (max 1 cut), 0 otherwise
Initialize dp[][] with all False values, except for base cases: dp[i][i] = True for single characters and dp[0][n-1] = True for the whole string if it's a palindrome
Fill in the table bottom-up:
For each cell [i][j]:
    Check if s[i..j] is palindromic (same characters when read forwards and backwards, ignoring separators)
        If true, set dp[i][j] to 1
        Else:
            For each possible separator position k from i+1 to j-1:
                Check if s[i..k] and s[k+1..j] are both palindromic
                    If true, set dp[i][j] = 1 (found a cut)
    Use memoization to store the results of expensive function calls and recompute only when necessary
