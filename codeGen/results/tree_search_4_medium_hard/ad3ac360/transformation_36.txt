Define a bottom-up dynamic programming approach:
Create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring s[i...j] is palindromic.

Base case: A single character is always a palindrome, so set dp[0][0] to True.

Fill the table from top to bottom and left to right:
For each position i in the string:
    For each previous position j less than or equal to i:
        If s[i] == s[j] (characters match) and the substring s[j+1...i-1] is also palindromic, then update dp[i][j] to True.
        Otherwise, backtrack to find the optimal partitioning.

To minimize cuts, initialize a variable min_cuts to n - 1. 
Iterate over the table from bottom to top:
    For each position i in the string:
        Find the previous position j such that dp[i][j] is True and the number of cuts is minimized.
        Update min_cuts accordingly.

Return min_cuts as the minimum number of cuts needed for palindrome partitioning of the given string.
