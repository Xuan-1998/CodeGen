===BEGIN PLAN===
Define a recursive function is_palindrome(s) that checks if a substring s is a palindrome. Since it has overlapping subproblems, consider using memoization to store the results of expensive function calls and avoid redundant computation.

Let dp be a boolean array where dp[i] represents whether the substring from index 0 to i can be palindrome-partitioned into smaller palindromic substrings.

1. Initialize dp[0] = True for empty string.
2. For each i from 1 to n-1:
    * If s[i-1] == s[i], then check if the substring s[0:i-1] is a palindrome and store it in memo.
    * Then, update dp[i] based on the following conditions:
        - If s[i-1] == s[i] and s[0:i-1] can be palindrome-partitioned, set dp[i] = True.
        - Otherwise, set dp[i] = False.

Store the state of palindromic substrings in a boolean array and use it for memoization.

3. Finally, return the minimum number of cuts required to partition the string into palindromic substrings by iterating over the dp array and finding the first index where dp[i] is False. This will be the last palindrome-partitioned substring that needs to be cut to form a new palindrome-partitioned substring.
