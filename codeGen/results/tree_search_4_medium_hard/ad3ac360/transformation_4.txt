===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a recursive function that checks if a substring is a palindrome, then use memoization to store the results of expensive function calls.

State: dp[i] represents whether the last cut at position i resulted in a palindrome partition.

Define the transition relationship as:
dp[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j]) and ((i - 1 >= 0) and dp[i-1][j-1]) or (j + 1 < n) and dp[i+1][j+1]),
where s is the input string.

Design a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table with all False values and then updating them based on the transition relationship:
dp[0][n-1] = True
for i from n - 2 down to 0 do
    for j from 0 to n - 2 do
        if (i == j) or (s[i] == s[j]) and ((i - 1 >= 0) and dp[i-1][j-1]) or (j + 1 < n) and dp[i+1][j+1]):
            dp[i][j] = True

Return the number of cuts needed by finding the maximum i such that dp[i][n-1] is False.
