===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring from index i to j is a palindrome.

Initialization:
    - Initialize all values in dp as False, except for dp[0][0] which is True since an empty string is a palindrome.
    
State Transition:
    - For each cell dp[i][j], check if the substring from i to j is a palindrome by comparing characters at positions i and j-1.
    - If the substring is a palindrome, then set dp[i][j] as True. Otherwise, set it as False.

Backtracking:
    - Start from the bottom-right corner of the array (dp[n-1][n-1]).
    - Find the last cell where dp[i][j] is True.
    - From that cell, move up and left until you reach a cell where dp[k][l] is False.
    - The number of cells visited in this process represents the minimum number of cuts needed to partition the string into palindromic substrings.
