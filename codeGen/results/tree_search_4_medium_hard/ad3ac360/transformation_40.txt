===BEGIN PLAN===
Define a recursive function that checks if a substring is a palindrome.

    @functools.lru_cache(None)
    def is_palindrome(s):
        return s == s[::-1]

Create a state variable representing the minimum number of cuts required to reach each prefix of the string.
Let dp be this state variable, initialized with all 0s. The transition relationship could be: 
for each character in the string:
    if it's not the same as the corresponding character from the end of the string (for palindrome check), 
        increment the cut count and update the DP table accordingly.

    n = len(s)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        is_palindrome_substr = False
        for j in range(i): 
            if s[j] == s[i - 1]:
                is_palindrome_substr = True
                break
        if not is_palindrome_substr:
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1
        else:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i - 1], 0)

Return the minimum number of cuts required to partition the string into palindromic substrings.

    return dp[-1]
