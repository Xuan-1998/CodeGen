===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} as a multiset. The number of different ways to create V can be calculated by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed.

Define dp[n][k] as the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in array M, and the k-th element of M is the (n+1)-th element of V. The base case is when n = 0, dp[0][i] = 1 for all i.

dp[i][j] can represent the number of different ways to create a collection V such that the j-th element of M is the (i+1)-th element of V.

For each element mi in M, consider it as the maximum value in V. For each possible position p of this maximum value in V, there are dp[i-1][p] ways to fill the rest of V. So, dp[i][j] = Î£(dp[i-1][p]) for all p such that 0 <= p <= i and mi is the (i+1)-th element of V.

The final answer is the sum of dp[n][i] for all i from 0 to n.
