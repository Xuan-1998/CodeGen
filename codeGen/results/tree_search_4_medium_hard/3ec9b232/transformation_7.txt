===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each partition is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

The state is dp[i][j] representing the number of ways to merge an array of size i with exactly j 1's.
let d0 be the number of ways to create V such that m0 is at index 0, and let d1 be the number of ways to create V such that m0 is not at index 0; dp[i][j] = sum(d0*d[1-1][j-x] + d1*d[i-1][x], x=0..i-1)

The plan can be improved by initializing the base cases correctly. For example, dp[0][0] should be 1 (since there is only one way to partition an empty set).

Additionally, edge cases need to be considered, such as when n = 1 or n = 2.
