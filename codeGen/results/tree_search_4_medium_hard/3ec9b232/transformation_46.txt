===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by considering all possible permutations of M. Each permutation corresponds to a unique way of creating V.

Define the state expression and base case as (i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1], with base case being dp(0, i) = 1 since there is only one way to consider all values. However, this will result in an incorrect solution because the same value can be considered multiple times.

State transition can be defined as dp(i, j) = sum(1 <= k <= i ? (M[j] == m_k ? dp(k-1, j-1) + dp(i-k, j-1) : 0) : 0) representing the number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1].

Utilize a recursive function with a cache dictionary and prune branches early by returning 0 if there are no more values left to consider.

To optimize the solution, we can sort M first to avoid considering duplicate permutations.

The plan also includes edge cases: n <= 12 and 1 <= m_i <= n.
