===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} as a multiset. The number of different ways to create V can be calculated by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed.

Define dp[n] as the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in array M. The base case is when n = 0, dp[0] = 1 (since there's only one way to create an empty array).

dp[i] can represent the number of different ways to create a collection V such that the i-th element of M is the minimum value in V.

For each i from 1 to n:
    If mi is equal to the previous element in M, then dp[i] is equal to the previous dp[i-1]. This is because there's no new way to place mi in the collection.
    Otherwise, calculate the number of different ways to create a collection V such that mi is the minimum value. This can be done by considering all possible collections with mi at the beginning and recursively calculating the number of different ways to create the rest of the collection.

Create an array dp of size n+1 and recursively calculate the value of dp[i] based on the previous values.

The final answer will be dp[n].
