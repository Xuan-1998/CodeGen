===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by considering all possible permutations of M.

Define the state expression and base case as:
dp(i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1] with value m_i at index i,
with base case being dp(n-1, n-1) = 0 since there are no more values to consider.

Employ memoization by using a dictionary to store and retrieve the values of dp(i, j) as needed. This is crucial because calculating dp(i, j) requires knowing the values of dp(k-1, j-1) for k from 0 to i, which would be computationally expensive without memoization.

The state transition should consider all possible ways to place m_i in the sorted array:
dp(i, j) = sum(dp(k-1, j-1) * (M[k-1] < m_i)) for k from 0 to i.
This takes into account all possible permutations of M where m_i is at index i.

Finally, initialize dp with base case values and fill up the dp table using memoization. The final answer would be dp(0, n-1) modulo 10^9+7.
