===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible permutations of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each permutation is represented as an array where the elements at each position determine the final output. The state is dp[i][p] where p is a permutation of n, and it represents the number of ways to match this specific permutation.
dp[i][p] should store the sum of the number of ways to match each element in the current permutation p, considering all possible permutations of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. The state transition would add or subtract 1 based on whether the current element is included in the permutation or not. However, this approach might lead to an exponential time complexity as there are n! possible permutations.
To improve this plan, we can consider using a dynamic programming approach with memoization. This way, we can reduce the time complexity and make the program more efficient.

Let's create a dynamic programming table dp where dp[i][p] stores the number of ways to match the permutation p for all possible permutations p and elements i. We start by initializing the base case where dp[0][p] is 1 as there is only one way to arrange an empty set.
Now, consider the recursive state transition:
dp[i][p] = (if p[i-1] is included in the permutation)
    sum(dp[j][q] for j from i-1 downto 1 and q is a permutation of {1, 2, ..., j})
+ (if p[i-1] is not included in the permutation)
    dp[i-1][p[1:i]]

This way, we can calculate the number of ways to match each permutation without recalculating the same sub-problems multiple times.
Finally, return dp[n][p] as the total number of different ways to create a collection V modulo 10^9+7.
