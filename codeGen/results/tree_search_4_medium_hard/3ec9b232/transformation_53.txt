===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} as a multiset. The number of different ways to create V can be calculated by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed.

Let dp[i][j] be the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in an array with elements from [1, i] containing exactly j occurrences of 1.
The state is (i, j) and the transition relationships can be formulated as follows: 
if m_i-1 < i and j > 0 then dp[i][j] += dp[m_i-1][j-1]
if m_i-1 >= i then dp[i][j] += dp[m_i-1][j]
Use a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to create a collection V with exactly j occurrences of 1 in an array from [1, i].

Handle edge cases: 
dp[0][j] = 0 for all j
dp[i][0] = 1 for all i
