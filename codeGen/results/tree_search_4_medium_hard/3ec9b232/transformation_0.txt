The plan is mostly correct, but there are some potential issues and areas for improvement:

1. **State Representation:** The state representation dp[i][j] seems correct, representing the number of ways to merge an array of size i with exactly j 1's.

2. **Initial Conditions:** It would be good to specify the base cases or initial conditions for the dynamic programming table. For example, what are the values of dp[0][0], dp[0][1], and so on? These values could potentially be calculated recursively or through some other means.

3. **Transition Function:** The plan lacks a clear transition function that describes how to calculate the value of dp[i][j] based on the previously computed values in the dynamic programming table. This is crucial for a dynamic programming approach, as it allows you to avoid recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.

4. **Edge Cases:** It would be good to specify edge cases and handle them explicitly. For example, what happens when i=0 or j=0? These special cases could potentially have different base cases than the rest of the dynamic programming table.

Here's an updated version of the plan that addresses these issues:
