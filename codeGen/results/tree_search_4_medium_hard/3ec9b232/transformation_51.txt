===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} as a multiset. The number of different ways to create V can be calculated by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed.

Let dp[i][j] be the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in an array with elements from [1, i] containing exactly j occurrences of 1. Let dp[i][k] be the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in an array with elements from [1, i] containing exactly k occurrences of 1.

The state is (i, k) and the transition relationships can be formulated as follows: if i > 0 and m_i-1 <= i, then dp[i][k] += dp[i-1][k]. If i > 0 and m_i-1 > i, then dp[i][k] += dp[i-1][k-m_i-1]. This is because when merging the array with elements from [1, i], we can either include or exclude the element m_i-1.

Memoization can be achieved by using a dictionary to store the intermediate results and avoid redundant computation. We can use a 2D array dp to store the state values.

The final answer will be the sum of dp[n][k] for all k such that 0 <= k <= n, modulo 10^9+7.
