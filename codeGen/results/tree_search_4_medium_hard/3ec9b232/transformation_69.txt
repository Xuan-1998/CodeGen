===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} as a multiset. The number of different ways to create V can be calculated by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed.

Let dp[i][j] be the number of different ways to partition the set {m0, m1, ..., mi} into j subsets such that each subset contains at most i elements. The base case is when j = 0, dp[i][0] = 1 (since there's only one way to create an empty array).

dp[i][j] should be equal to the sum of dp[k][l-1]*choose(i, k) for all k from 1 to i and l from 1 to j

We can use a dictionary to store intermediate results.

For edge cases, consider when n or m_i is very large. In this case, we might need to handle these cases separately.

To improve the plan, we could also consider using memoization techniques like dynamic programming to speed up the calculation.
