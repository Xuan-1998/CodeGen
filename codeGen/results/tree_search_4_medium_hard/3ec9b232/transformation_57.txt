===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} as a multiset. The number of different ways to create V can be calculated by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed.

Define dp[n] as the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in array M. The base case is when n = 0, dp[0] = 1 (since there's only one way to create an empty array).

dp[i] can represent the number of different ways to create a collection V such that the i-th element of M is the maximum value in V.

Another option is to use a memoized function that recursively calculates the number of ways for each subproblem. Let's define a function f(i, j) as the number of different ways to create a collection V such that the i-th element of M is the maximum value and the elements from 1 to j are in ascending order.

f(0, j) = 1 (since there's only one way to create an empty array), and for 1 <= i <= n:

f(i, j) = f(i-1, j) * (j - m_{i-1} + 1)

This function can be memoized and used to calculate the number of different ways to create a collection V.

For example, if M = [3, 2, 5], we can calculate dp[3] as follows:

dp[0] = 1
dp[1] = f(1, 2) * (2 - m_0 + 1)
= f(0, 2) * (2)
= 1 * 2
= 2

dp[2] = f(2, 3) * (3 - m_1 + 1)
= f(1, 3) * (3 - 2 + 1)
= f(1, 2) * (1) * 1
= 2 * 1
= 2

dp[3] = f(3, 5) * (5 - m_2 + 1)
= f(2, 5) * (5 - 5 + 1)
= f(2, 4) * (1) * 1
= 2 * 1
= 2

So, the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in [3, 2, 5] is dp[3] = 2 + 2 = 4.

This plan takes care of edge cases by considering all possible multisets with the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed. It also includes a base case to handle the empty array and recursive cases to calculate the number of different ways to create a collection V.
