===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each partition is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

Let's initialize the dynamic programming table with size (n+1) x (k+1), where n is the size of the input array and k is the maximum number of subsets. We'll consider all possible partitions and update the state dp[i][j] representing the number of ways to place exactly j 1's in an array of size i.

The base case is when there are no more elements to place, so dp[0][j] = 1 for any j.

For each element from 1 to n:

* For every subset with up to k elements that contains this element:
	+ Update the state dp[i][j] by adding the number of ways to place exactly j-1 1's in an array of size i-1, considering all possible partitions.
* Update the maximum number of subsets k if needed.

The final answer is the sum of all values in the last row (dp[n][0], ..., dp[n][k]) modulo 10^9+7.
