===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each partition is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

Let dp[i][j] represent the number of ways to merge an array of size i with exactly j 1's. We can use dynamic programming with nested loops:

dp[0][0] = 1
for i from 1 to n:
    for j from 0 to min(i, n):
        dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][x] * dp[n-k-1][y] for k in range(j+1) for x in range(min(j, k)) for y in range(min(n-j-1, n-k-1)))
return dp[n][0] % (10**9 + 7)
