===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by considering all possible permutations of M. Each permutation corresponds to a unique way of creating V.

Define the state expression and base case as dp(i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1], with base case being dp(0, i) = 1 since there is only one way to consider all elements (i.e., in order).

Create a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (n+1) to store the state values. Initialize the entire array as 0 except for dp(0, n) = 1.

For each i from 1 to n:
    For each j from i-1 to n:
        If M[i-1] <= M[j]:
            Update dp(i, j) as the sum of dp(i-1, k) for all k in range(j+1, i).
        Otherwise:
            Update dp(i, j) as 0.

The final answer is dp(n, n).
