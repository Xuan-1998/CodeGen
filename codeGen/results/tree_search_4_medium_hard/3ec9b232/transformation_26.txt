===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by considering all possible permutations of M.

Define the state expression and base case as dp(i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1], with base case being dp(0, 0) = 1 since there is only one way to create an empty collection.

Consider the state as (i, j) where i represents the current element in M and j is the length of the subarray to be sorted. For each state, iterate through all possible values of V that can merge into a sorted array with M[:j+1]. Use memoization to store the results for each state.

Utilize a set data structure to keep track of unique permutations and avoid duplicates. When adding an element to V, check if it already exists in the set and skip if it does. This ensures that duplicate permutations are not counted.

To improve the plan, consider using bit manipulation to efficiently iterate through all possible values of V.

Potential issues with the plan include:

* Handling edge cases: What happens when j is equal to i? In this case, dp(i, j) should return 1 since there is only one way to create an empty collection.
* Avoiding duplicates: The set data structure will help avoid duplicate permutations, but it's essential to ensure that the set is updated correctly.
