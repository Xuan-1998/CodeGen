===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by considering all possible permutations of M.

Each permutation corresponds to a unique way of creating V.

Define the state expression and base case as:
dp(i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1],
with base case being dp(0, 0) = 1 since there is only one way to create an empty collection.

Consider the state as (i, j, k) where:
i represents the current element in M,
j is the length of the subarray to be sorted,
k represents the number of elements already in V.

Use a dictionary to store the intermediate results for faster lookups.
dp(0, 0) = 1
for i from 1 to n-1:
    for j from 0 to n-i-1:
        for k from 0 to j:
            if M[i] <= M[k]:
                dp(i, j) += dp(k, j-k-1)
            else:
                dp(i, j) = (dp(i, j) + dp(k, j-k-1)) % (10^9+7)

return dp(n-1, n-1) % (10^9+7)
