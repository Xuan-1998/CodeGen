===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} as a multiset. The number of different ways to create V can be calculated by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed.

Define dp[n] as the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in array M. The base case is when n = 0, dp[0] = 1 (since there's only one way to create an empty array).

Let f(i) be the number of different multisets that can be formed with i elements from the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1}. Then dp[i] = f(i) * (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + ... + dp[0]).

Memoize function calls by using dictionary to store the results of subproblems and return the memoized result if the problem has been solved before.

The updated plan can be represented as a recursive function with memoization, which calculates the number of different multisets that can be formed with i elements from the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements but with some repetitions allowed. The base case is when n = 0, and the recursive function calls itself for smaller values of i until it reaches the base case.
