===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each partition is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

The state dp[i][j] representing the number of ways to merge an array of size i with exactly j 1's.
let d0 be the number of ways to create V such that m0 is at index 0, and let d1 be the number of ways to create V such that m0 is not at index 0;
dp[i][j] = sum(d0*dp[i-1][j-x] + d1*dp[i-1][x], x=0..i-1)

Let dp[i][k] be the number of ways to merge an array of size i with exactly k 1's.
Initial state: dp[0][0] = 1 (one way to create V with no elements)

Transition function:
dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][x], x=0..j) if j > 0
dp[i][j] = 1 if j == 0

Final state: dp[n][k] (where k is the number of ones in M)
The answer is dp[n][k]%10^9+7

This plan avoids potential issues by considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}, and handles edge cases by initializing the state correctly.
