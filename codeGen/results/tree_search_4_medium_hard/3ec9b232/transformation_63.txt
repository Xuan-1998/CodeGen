===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} as a multiset. The number of different ways to create V can be calculated by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed.

Define dp[n] as the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in array M. The base case is when n = 0, dp[0] = 1 (since there's only one way to create an empty array).

dp[i] can represent the number of different ways to create a collection V such that the i-th element of M is the median value in V.

Let's break it down further:

- For each i from 1 to n, calculate dp[i] as the sum of:
  * The number of ways to place m_i at the i-th position in the array (this can be calculated recursively by considering the positions before i)
  * The number of ways to create V such that merging V into a sorted array results in an array ending with m_i (this can be done by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed)

Use dynamic programming to build up a table dp where dp[i] represents the number of different ways to create V such that the i-th element of M is the median value in V
