Let dp[i][j] be the number of different ways to partition the set {m0, m1, ..., mi} into j subsets such that each subset contains at most i elements.

The base case is when j = 0, dp[i][0] = 1 (since there's only one way to create an empty array).

dp[i][j] should be calculated by considering all possible partitions of the set {m0, m1, ..., mi} into j subsets. 

For each element mi in the set, consider the following two options:

1. Include mi in a subset that already contains at most i-1 elements.
   This can be done dp[i-1][j-1] times.

2. Create a new subset with only mi and include it in the partition.
   This can also be done dp[i-1][j] times.

The total number of ways to partition the set into j subsets such that each subset contains at most i elements is then:

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]

This process continues until we reach the base case, where j = 0.

Implement a memoization function using a dictionary to store previously computed values of dp[i][j].

Finally, initialize the result as 0 and calculate it by considering all possible partitions of the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} into n subsets. The final answer will be the value of dp[n][n] modulo 10^9+7.

This plan should give us a correct dynamic programming solution to the problem.
