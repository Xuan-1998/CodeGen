===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by considering all possible permutations of M. Each permutation corresponds to a unique way of creating V.

Define the state expression and base case as:
dp(i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1] with value m_i at index i,
base case: dp(n-1, n-1) = 0 since there are no more values to consider.

To use memoization, define a recursive function and store intermediate results in a dictionary for later reuse.
State transition:
dp(i, j) = sum(dp(k, j-1) * (M[k-1] == m_i)) for k from 0 to i.

The plan can be improved by handling edge cases:
- When calculating dp(i, j), consider the base case when j < i, since there are no more values to consider.
- Initialize the memoization dictionary with default value of 0, to avoid potential null pointer exceptions.
