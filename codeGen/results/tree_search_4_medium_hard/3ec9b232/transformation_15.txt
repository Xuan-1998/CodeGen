===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each partition is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

Let dp[i][p] represent the number of ways to match the first i elements with the current partition p.
The state transition could be based on whether the current element is included in the partition or not.

For an empty set (i.e., all '0's), there's only one way to match it: by having no subsets. For a non-empty set (i.e., at least one '1'), we can consider including the current element in the subset, and recursively calculate the number of ways for the remaining elements.

The base case would be when i is equal to n, representing the complete array M. At this point, dp[i][p] should represent the total number of different ways to create collection V modulo 10^9+7.
