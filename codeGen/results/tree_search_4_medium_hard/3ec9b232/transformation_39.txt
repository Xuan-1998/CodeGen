===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by considering all possible permutations of M. Each permutation corresponds to a unique way of creating V.

Define the state expression and base case as (i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1], with base case being dp(0, i) = 0 since there are no more values to consider.

Choose the state as (i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1], with base case being dp[0][i] = 0 since there are no more values to consider.

Consider a bottom-up approach by creating a 2D table where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to create V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1].

The plan seems correct and covers all possible cases. To improve it, you could add edge cases like when n is 0 or all elements are equal.
