===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each partition is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

Let dp[i][j] represent the number of ways to merge an array of size i with exactly j 1's.
dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to create a collection V of arrays such that merging V into a sorted array results in an array of size i with exactly j 1's.

The base case is when i == j, representing the only way to have an array of size i with all elements equal to 1. So dp[i][i] = 1 for all i.

For the recursive case, we consider two cases:
- Case 1: The last element in the array is 0.
In this case, we can either include it in a subset or not. If we include it, we get dp[i - 1][j - 1] ways to create the remaining array. If we don't include it, we get dp[i - 1][j] ways to create the remaining array. So the total number of ways is dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j].

- Case 2: The last element in the array is 1.
In this case, there's only one way to include it in a subset (i.e., by including all elements equal to 1), so we get dp[i - 1][j] ways.

The total number of ways is then dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j].

To memoize the results, use a dictionary where each key is a tuple (i, j) and the value is the calculated result. This way, we can avoid redundant calculations and improve the efficiency.
