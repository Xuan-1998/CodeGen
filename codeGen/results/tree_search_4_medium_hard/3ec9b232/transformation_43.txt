===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by considering all possible permutations of M. Each permutation corresponds to a unique way of creating V.

Define the state expression and base case as dp(i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1], with base case being dp(0, i) = 1 since there is exactly one way to arrange the first i elements, which is the identity permutation.

Consider all possible permutations of M. Each permutation corresponds to a unique way of creating V. Let the state be (i, j) where i is the number of elements considered so far and j is the current element in M.

Use a dictionary dp_dict to implement memoization, where keys are tuples and values are the computed state values.

For each pair (i, j), calculate the state value by iterating over all possible indices k in range(i-1) to 0 and summing up the number of ways to arrange the first i-1 elements as M[:k+1] and the current element j. This is because any permutation that results in M[:j+1] must have resulted in M[:k+1] for some k.

Then, increment this value by the number of ways to arrange the current element j at the end (which is 1 if j == i-1 or j == 0, and otherwise it's the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements).

Finally, return dp(i, n-1) as the answer, which represents the total number of ways to create V.
