===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} as a multiset. The number of different ways to create V can be calculated by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed.

Let dp[i][j] be the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in an array with elements from [1, i] containing exactly j occurrences of 1. Let's initialize dp[0][0] = 1 as there is only one way to form an empty multiset.

The state is (i, k) and the transition relationships can be formulated as follows: if m_i-1 <= i, then dp[i][k] += dp[i-1][min(k, m_i-1)], or if m_i-1 > i, then dp[i][k] += dp[i-1][k]. The function min(k, m_i-1) ensures that we don't exceed the maximum occurrences of 1.

A bottom-up approach is also possible, where you iterate over the input array from left to right and maintain a running count of elements that have been seen before. For each i, you can calculate dp[i][k] = (dp[i-1][0] + dp[i-1][1] + ... + dp[i-1][k]) if m_i is equal to i+1, or dp[i][k] = dp[i-1][k] otherwise. This approach ensures that the order of elements in V doesn't matter.

Finally, return (dp[n-1][0] + dp[n-1][1] + ... + dp[n-1][k]) % (10^9+7) as the result, where k is the maximum number of occurrences of 1.
