===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible permutations of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each permutation represents a unique way to partition the array into subsets, and the number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

The state is dp[i][j] representing the number of ways to merge an array of size i with exactly j 1's. 

let d0 be the number of ways to create V such that m0 is at index 0, 
and let d1 be the number of ways to create V such that m0 is not at index 0; 

dp[i][j] = sum(d0*d[ i-1 ][ j-1 ] + d1*d[ i-1 ][ j ], x=0..i-1) for all i > 1 and 0 <= j <= i

Create a memoized function that uses a dictionary or cache to store the results of subproblems, so that when the same subproblem is encountered again, it can be looked up in the cache instead of recomputed.

Initialize dp[0][j] = 1 for all 0 <= j <= n. This represents the base case where there are no elements left to partition.

Fill up the dp table using the recurrence relation above and iterate over all possible partitions of {1, 2, ..., n}.

Finally, return dp[n][k] where k is the number of 1's in M.
