===BEGIN PLAN===
dp(i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1] with value m_i at index i.
Define the state expression and base case as dp(n-1, n-1) = 0 since there are no more values to consider.

For j = 0 to n-1:
    Initialize dp(i, j) = 0
    For k from 0 to i:
        If M[k] <= m_i:
            dp(i, j) += dp(k, j)
        Else:
            dp(i, j) += sum(dp(l, j) for l in range(k+1, i+1))
    Return dp(n-1, n-2)

Memoize the state transition function with a dictionary and update it recursively
