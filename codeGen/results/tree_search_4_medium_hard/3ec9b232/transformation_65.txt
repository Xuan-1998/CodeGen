===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} as a multiset. The number of different ways to create V can be calculated by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed.

Let dp[i][j] be the number of different ways to partition the set {m0, m1, ..., mi} into j subsets such that each subset contains at most i elements. The base case is when j = 0, dp[i][0] = 1 (since there's only one way to create an empty array).

dp[i][j] should represent the number of ways to partition the set {m0, m1, ..., mi} into j subsets such that each subset contains at most i elements.

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to partition the set {m0, m1, ..., mi} into j subsets such that each subset contains at most i elements. For any i and j, we can calculate dp[i][j] as follows:

* If j = 0, dp[i][j] = 1
* Otherwise, for each possible value k from 1 to min(i, m[i-1]), add up the number of ways to partition the first i-1 elements into j-1 subsets (dp[i-1][j-1]) and multiply it by the number of ways to place k in one of these j-1 subsets. This is because we are considering all possible ways to include m[i-1] in the partition.

This plan looks correct, but it can be improved by using a more efficient way to calculate dp[i][j]. One possible optimization is to use a 2D array cum instead of dp, where cum[i][j] represents the number of ways to partition the set {m0, m1, ..., mi} into j subsets such that each subset contains at most i elements and also includes all elements up to i. This allows us to avoid recalculating the same values multiple times.

There are no obvious edge cases that need special handling. The plan should work correctly for inputs of size up to 12,000.
