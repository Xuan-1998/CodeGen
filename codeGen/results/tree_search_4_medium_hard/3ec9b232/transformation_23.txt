===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each partition is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

Let dp[i][p] be the state that stores the number of ways to match the current partition p considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., i}. Then, dp[n][p] will represent the total number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array using a specific algorithm results in M.

The state transition can be calculated as follows:

- If p[i-1] is '0', it means the current element i is not included in the partition. So, dp[i][p] = dp[i-1][p]
- If p[i-1] is '1', it means the current element i is included in the partition. Then, dp[i][p] = dp[i-1][p^2] where ^2 denotes the bitwise XOR operation

The state transition will add or subtract 1 based on whether the current element is included in the partition or not.

Use a set memo instead of a dictionary since we only need to store unique partitions.
