===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by considering all possible permutations of M. Each permutation corresponds to a unique way of creating V.

Define the state expression and base case as dp(i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1], with base case being dp(0, i) = 1 since there is exactly one way to create an empty collection.

Choose the state as (i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1], with base case being dp(0, i) = 1 since there is exactly one way to create an empty collection.

Define a recursive function that calculates the state by considering all possible permutations of M[:i] and memoize it using a dictionary or a cache. For each permutation, calculate the number of ways to append the remaining elements in M[j+1:] such that merging the permutation into a sorted array results in M[:j+1]. Add this value to the total count.

Initialize the dynamic programming table with base case values and fill up the rest of the table using the recursive function. Finally, return dp(n-1, n-1) as the answer.
