===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each partition is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

We initialize dp[0][0] to 1 since there's only one way to place no elements in an array of size 0 (the empty set).

The state is dp[i][j] representing the number of ways to place exactly j 1's in an array of size i. 

dp[i][j] represents the number of subsets in each partition that has exactly j elements.

We use a two-dimensional dynamic programming table where dp[i][0] = 1 for all i since there's only one way to place no elements in an array of size i (the empty set). dp[i][j] is calculated as the sum of dp[i-1][k] where k varies from 0 to j. This represents the number of ways to place exactly j 1's by adding a new element to each of the previous partitions that have j-1 elements.

Finally, we calculate the answer as the sum of dp[n][j] for all j from 0 to n. This gives us the total number of different ways to create collection V modulo 10^9+7.
