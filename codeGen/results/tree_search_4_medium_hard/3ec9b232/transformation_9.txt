===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each partition is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

Let's define dp[i][j] representing the number of ways to place exactly j 1's in an array of size i.

The state transition is as follows:
- If there are no elements left (i.e., j = 0), then there is only one way to arrange them, which is to not include any of them.
- If we have k elements remaining and we want to place exactly j 1's in the array, then this can be done in dp[k - 1][j] ways. We can place the current element either in an empty subset (0) or a non-empty subset (1), which gives us two choices.
- The base case is when there are no elements left, i.e., j = 0.

To use dynamic programming to create a table where each cell dp[i][j] is computed from the previous cells, considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}.
- Initialize the base cases: dp[0][0] = 1 (since there's only one way to arrange no elements).
- For each i from 1 to n:
    - For each j from 0 to i:
        - Calculate dp[i][j] based on the state transition.
- The final answer is the value of dp[n][k], where k is the number of ones in the array M.
