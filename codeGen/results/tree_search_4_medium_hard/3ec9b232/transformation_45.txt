===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by considering all possible permutations of M.

Define the state expression and base case as (i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1], with base case being dp(0, i) = 1 since there is only one way to consider all values.

State transition can be defined as dp(i, j) = sum((i-1)!/(k!(i-k-1)!) * (M[j] == m_k ? dp(k, j-1) + dp(i-k-1, j-1) : 0)) representing the number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1].

Dynamically generate a 2D table using nested loops

for n from 1 to 12,000:
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        dp[i][n] = 1
    for j from n-1 downto 0:
        for i from 0 to j:
            dp[i][j] = sum((j)!/(k!(j-k)!) * (M[j] == m_k ? dp[k][j-1] + dp[i-k-1][j-1] : 0))

print(dp[0][n-1]%10^9+7)
