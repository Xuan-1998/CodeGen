===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible permutations of the array $M$. Each permutation is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each permutation determines the final output.

The state is dp[i][j] representing the number of ways to place exactly j 1's in an array of size i, considering all possible permutations.

Use a memoized function that recursively calculates the number of ways for each possible partition.

For each i from 0 to n:
    Initialize dp[0][0] = 1
    For each j from 0 to n:
        If j == 0 or j == 1:
            dp[i][j] = 1
        Else:
            For each k from 0 to j-1:
                dp[i][j] += dp[k][0] * (dp[i-k-1][j-k-1] - dp[i-k-1][j-k])
    Return dp[n][n]
