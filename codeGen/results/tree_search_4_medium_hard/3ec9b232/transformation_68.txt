Let dp[i][j] be the number of different ways to partition the set {m0, m1, ..., mi} into j subsets such that each subset contains at most i elements. The base case is when j = 0, dp[i][0] = 1 (since there's only one way to create an empty array).
To calculate dp[i][j], we can consider the following: for every possible partition of {m0, m1, ..., mi} into l subsets with at most i elements in each subset (which is calculated by dp[k][l-1]*binomial(i, k) for all k from 1 to i and l from 1 to j), we can add the number of ways to distribute the remaining elements (i - k) among these l subsets.
This can be done recursively: let dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][l-1]*binomial(i, k) for all k from 1 to i and l from 1 to j). The binomial coefficient is calculated using the formula (i!)/(k!(i-k)!).
Use a dynamic programming table with nested loops to calculate dp[i][j] values. Initialize the base case dp[0][j] = 1 for all j.
For each i from 1 to n and j from 0 to j, calculate dp[i][j] using the above recursive formula.
The final answer is dp[n][n].
