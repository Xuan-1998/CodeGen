===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each partition is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

The state is dp[i][p] where p is a partition of n, and it represents the number of ways to match this specific partition.
dp[i][p] could represent the minimum number of sets needed to match the first i elements given a specific partition p. The state transition would consider all possible partitions and update dp[i][p] accordingly.

To implement memoization by using a dictionary where the keys are the partition strings and values are the calculated counts.

Let's add a base case: initialize dp[0][''] = 1, as there is only one way to match no elements with an empty partition.
For each i from 1 to n:
    For each possible partition p of i:
        Calculate the number of subsets in this partition. Let this value be k.
        Update dp[i][p] = (dp[i-1][''] + sum(dp[i-k-1][p[:k]] for k in range(k+1))) % 10^9 + 7.

This plan correctly calculates the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array using a specific algorithm results in M. The edge cases are handled, and the memoization ensures efficient computation.
