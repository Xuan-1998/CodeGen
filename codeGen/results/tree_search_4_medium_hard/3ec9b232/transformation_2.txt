===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible permutations of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each permutation is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each permutation determines the final output.

The state is dp[i][j] representing the number of ways to merge an array of size i with exactly j 1's, and its corresponding permutation.

dp[0][0] = 1 (base case: one way to create an empty array)

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by iterating over all possible lengths i from 1 to n and for each length i, iterate over all possible numbers of '1's j from 0 to min(i, m_count) where m_count is the count of '1's in the input array M.

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][l] * comb(i-k-1, j-l-1)) for k=0 to i-1 and l=0 to min(j, k)

Here, comb(i-k-1, j-l-1) represents the number of ways to place '1's in the remaining positions after merging arrays of size k with exactly l 1's.

Return dp[n][m_count] as the final output.
