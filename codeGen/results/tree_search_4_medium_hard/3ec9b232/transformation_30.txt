===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by considering all possible permutations of M. Each permutation corresponds to a unique way of creating V.

Define the state expression and base case as dp(i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1] with value m_i at index i, with base case being dp(n-1, n-1) = 0 since there are no more values to consider.

dp(i, j) represents the number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1] with value m_i at index i, and state transition: dp(i, j) = sum(dp(k, j-1) * (M[k-1] == m_i)) for k from 0 to i.

To implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach using a 2D table dp[][] where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to create V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1] with value m_i at index i:

    Initialize the dp table as a 2D array of size (n, n) filled with zeros.

    Fill the dp table row by row from bottom up: for each state (i, j), calculate the number of ways to create V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1] with value m_i at index i.

    Calculate the total number of ways by summing up the values in the last row of the dp table: res = sum(dp[i][n-1]) for i from 0 to n-1.

    Return the total number of ways modulo 10^9+7.
