===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} as a multiset. The number of different ways to create V can be calculated by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed.

Let dp[i][j] be the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in an array with elements from [1, i] containing exactly j occurrences of 1. Let's assume that m0 <= ... <= mn-1 for simplicity.

The state is (i, k) and the transition relationships can be formulated as follows: if i > 0 and m_i-1 <= i, then dp[i][k] += dp[i-1][k], or if i > 0 and m_i-1 > i, then dp[i][k] += dp[i-1][max(0, k - (i - m_i-1))].

The base case is dp[0][j] = 1 for j in [0, n]. The initial state is (n, 0).

You can implement dynamic programming using a 2D array to store the results of subproblems.

For edge cases, consider what happens when i < m_i-1 or k > i - m_i-1. These are handled by the transition relationships.
