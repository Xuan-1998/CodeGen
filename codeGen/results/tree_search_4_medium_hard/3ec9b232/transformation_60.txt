===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} as a multiset. The number of different ways to create V can be calculated by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed.

Define dp[n] as the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in array M. The base case is when n = 0, dp[0] = 1 (since there's only one way to create an empty array).

dp[i] can represent the number of different ways to create a collection V such that the i-th element of M is the minimum value in V.

Use a hash map to store the memoized results and update the values accordingly. For each i, calculate dp[i] as the sum of all possible multisets that have m_i as their minimum value.

Update dp[i] by considering the previous elements in the array (from 0 to i-1) and the current element m_i. This can be done by calculating the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in an array with the first i elements as M[0], M[1], ..., M[i-1] and m_i.

For edge cases, consider when n = 0 or when all elements are equal (i.e., the same element is present in every position).
