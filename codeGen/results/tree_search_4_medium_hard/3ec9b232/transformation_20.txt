===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each partition is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

Let's define a dynamic programming table dp[i][p] where p is a partition of n, and it represents the minimum number of sets needed to match the first i elements given a specific partition p.

The state transition would consider all possible partitions and update dp[i][p] accordingly. This can be done by iterating over each element from 1 to i and considering all possible subsets that include this element.

To create a recursive function that calculates dp[i][p] using the state transition rules, then apply memoization using a dictionary.

The base case for the recursion would be when i is equal to n, in which case there is only one way to match the partition.

The updated version of the plan:
