===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each partition is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

The state dp[i][j] representing the number of ways to merge an array of size i with exactly j 1's can be calculated recursively as follows:

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][x] * dp[n-k-1][y] for k in range(j+1) for x in range(min(j, k)) for y in range(min(n-j-1, n-k-1)))

Memoization using a dictionary with recursive function calls is used to avoid redundant computations.

The base case is when i = 0 or j = 0, where dp[i][j] is either 0 (when i > 0 and j > 0) or 1 (when i == 0 or j == 0).

The final answer is the value of dp[n-1][m-1], where m is the number of ones in the array M.
