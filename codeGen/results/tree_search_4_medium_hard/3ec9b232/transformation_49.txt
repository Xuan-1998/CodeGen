===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} as a multiset. The number of different ways to create V can be calculated by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed.

Let dp[i][j] be the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in an array with elements from [1, i] containing exactly j occurrences of 1. 

The state is (i, j) and the transition relationships can be formulated as follows: 
if i > 0 and m_i-1 = i, then dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1], or if i > 0 and m_i-1 != i, then dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j]. 

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming table using a 2D array with O(n^2) space complexity and fill it up iteratively based on the given recurrence relation. We need to consider all possible values of j from 0 to i.

The base case is when i = 1, there is only one way to create V which is an empty collection.

We can start filling up the dp table from the top row (i=1) and then move down, for each cell fill it up based on the transition relationships. 

When we are done filling up the dp table, we can find the answer in the bottom right corner, that is, dp[n][?], where ? is the number of occurrences of 1 in the array.

The time complexity is O(n^2) and the space complexity is also O(n^2). The modulo operation will be performed at the end to get the result modulo 10^9+7.
