===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each partition is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

Let dp[i][p] be the state representing the minimum number of sets needed to match the first i elements given a specific partition p.

The state transition would consider all possible partitions and update dp[i][p] accordingly.

To use a 2D array with dimensions (n+1) x 2^n to store the dynamic programming states, filling in the cells from top-down or bottom-up.

For each cell dp[i][p], consider all subsets of the first i elements that correspond to partition p. For each subset s, update dp[i][p] based on whether s is a subset of any existing set or not. If it is, then decrement the size of the set by 1 and consider the remaining elements. Otherwise, create a new set with size equal to the number of elements in s.

To handle edge cases, make sure to initialize dp[0][p] correctly for all partitions p. For example, if the partition corresponds to a single element, then dp[0][p] should be 1 because there is only one way to match that element (i.e., by itself).

This plan seems correct and provides a clear direction for solving the problem.
