===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each partition is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

The state is dp[i][p] where p is a partition of n, and it represents the number of ways to match this specific partition.
dp[i][p] should store the sum of the number of ways to match each subset in the current partition p, considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. The state transition would add or subtract 1 based on whether the current element is included in the partition or not.

Maintain a dictionary memo where memo[p] stores the result of evaluating dp[0][p].

Let's iterate over each number from 1 to n. For each number i:
    Initialize an empty dictionary memo for the current partition.
    Iterate over all possible partitions p of n - i (where n is the size of array M).
        Calculate dp[i][p] based on the current partition and memo[p].
        Update memo with the new value.

The final result will be the sum of all values in dp[n][p] for all p, taken modulo 10^9 + 7.
