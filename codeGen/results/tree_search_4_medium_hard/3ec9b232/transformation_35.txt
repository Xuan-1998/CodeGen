===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization.

Define the state expression and base case as (i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1] with value m_i at index i, with base case being dp(n-1, n-1) = 1 since there is only one way to order the remaining elements.

dp(i, j) represents the number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1] with value m_i at index i, and state transition: dp(i, j) = (M[:i].count(m_i)) * dp(i-1, j).

Use memoization by storing the calculated values of dp(i, j) in a dictionary memo to avoid redundant calculations.
