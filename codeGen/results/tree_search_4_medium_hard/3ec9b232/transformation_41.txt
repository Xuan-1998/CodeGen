This is because when creating V, we can either include m_i at any position from 0 to i-1 and then recursively consider the remaining positions (i-1, j), or exclude m_i and recursively consider the same positions. This ensures that all possible permutations of M are considered.

Finally, return dp(n-1, n-1) modulo 10^9+7 as the answer.
