===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by considering all possible permutations of M. Each permutation corresponds to a unique way of creating V.

Define the state expression and base case as (i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1], with base case being dp(0, 0) = 1 since there is only one way to create an empty collection.

To fill up the table dp[i][j], for each i and j, calculate the number of ways to create V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1] by considering all possible elements that can be added to the current sorted subarray. This can be done recursively as follows:

For i = 0, set dp[i][j] to 1 for all j (since there is only one way to create an empty collection).

For i > 0, if M[j] < M[i-1], then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] since the current element can be added in any of the previously calculated ways.

If M[j] >= M[i-1], then consider all possible elements that can be added to the current sorted subarray. This can be done by iterating over all indices k such that M[k] < M[i-1]. For each such k, add dp[i-1][k] to dp[i][j].

Finally, return dp[n-1][n-2] as the number of ways to create V.
