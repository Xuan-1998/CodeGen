The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each partition is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

The state is dp[i][p] where p is a partition of n, and it represents the number of ways to match this specific partition.
dp[i][p] should represent the number of ways to match the first i elements with the current partition p, considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. The state transition could be based on whether the current element is included in the partition or not.

Dynamic programming using a dictionary to store subproblems:

for i from 0 to n-1:
    for p in all possible partitions of n:
        if i == 0: 
            dp[0][p] = 1 (base case)
        else:
            total_ways = 0
            for j from 0 to i-1:
                if p[j] == '1': 
                    ways_to_match_j = dp[j][partition_at_j(p, i)]
                    total_ways += ways_to_match_j
            dp[i][p] = total_ways

def partition_at_j(p, j):
    new_p = ''
    for k from 0 to j-1:
        new_p += '0'
    for k from j to n-1:
        if p[k] == '1': 
            new_p += '1' + '0' * (j-k-1)
        else: 
            new_p += '0' + '0' * (j-k-1)
    return new_p
