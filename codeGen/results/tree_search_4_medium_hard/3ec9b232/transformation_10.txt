===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each partition is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

The state dp[i][j] representing the number of ways to place exactly j 1's in an array of size i.

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][l] * binomial(i-k, j-l) for k in range(j+1) for l in range(j+1) if k + l == j)

To avoid double-counting, we only need to consider partitions where the number of subsets is equal to j.

dp[i][0] = 1 (base case: placing exactly 0 ones)

Initialize dp with base cases:

dp[0][j] = 0 for j in range(n+1) (no way to place ones in an empty array)

Fill dp table using the recurrence relation:

for i in range(1, n+1):
    for j in range(j+1):
        if j == 0:
            dp[i][j] = 1
        else:
            dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][l] * binomial(i-k, j-l) for k in range(j+1) for l in range(j+1) if k + l == j)

Return the value of dp[n][j], which represents the number of ways to place exactly j ones.
