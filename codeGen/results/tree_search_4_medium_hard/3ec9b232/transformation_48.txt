===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} as a multiset. The number of different ways to create V can be calculated by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed.

Let dp[i][j] be the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in an array with elements from [1, i] containing exactly j occurrences of 1. The base case is when i = 0, then dp[0][j] = 1 for all j.

Let's consider the state transition. If m_i-1 = i, it means that the last element added to the array is equal to its index. In this case, we can add i as a new element to the collection in exactly (j - 1) ways if j > 0. So, dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1].

On the other hand, if m_i-1 != i, it means that the last element added to the array is not equal to its index. In this case, we can add any number from [1, i] as a new element to the collection in j ways. So, dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j].

Use memoization by creating a dictionary where the keys are tuples (i, j) and the values are the calculated dp[i][j] values.

Initialize the dp array with base cases for all i and j such that 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j <= n. Then fill in the dp array based on the state transitions above. Finally, return dp[n-1][0] as the result.
