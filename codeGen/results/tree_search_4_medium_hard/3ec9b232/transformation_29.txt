===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by considering all possible permutations of M. Each permutation corresponds to a unique way of creating V.

Define the state expression and base case as (i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1], with base case being dp(0, 0) = 1 since there is only one way to create an empty collection.

To improve the plan, consider using a top-down approach with memoization instead of tabulation. This can reduce the time complexity by avoiding the need to fill up the entire table.

Potential issues include:
* The plan does not account for edge cases where n or M values are outside the given constraints.
* The plan assumes that all elements in M are distinct, but it doesn't explicitly check for this condition.
