===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} as a multiset. The number of different ways to create V can be calculated by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed.

Define dp[n] as the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in array M. The base case is when n = 0, dp[0] = 1 (since there's only one way to create an empty array).

dp[i] can represent the number of different ways to create a collection V such that the i-th element of M is the maximum value in V.

For each element mi in the input multiset, we can consider two cases: 
- If mi is the maximum value in the current collection V, then we can choose any number of repetitions of this value from 0 to n. This corresponds to a recursive case where we consider all possible ways to create a collection V with one fewer element.
- If mi is not the maximum value in the current collection V, then we need to consider all possible values that could be the maximum value and recursively calculate their number of occurrences.

The updated plan:
