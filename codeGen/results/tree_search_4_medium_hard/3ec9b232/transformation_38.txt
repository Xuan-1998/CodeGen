===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by considering all possible permutations of M.

Each permutation corresponds to a unique way of creating V.

Define the state expression and base case as:
dp(i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1] with value m_i at index i,
with base case being dp(n-1, n-1) = 0 since there are no more values to consider.

State transition:
dp(i, j) = sum(dp(k-1, j-1) * (M[k-1] < m_i)) for k from 0 to i.
This is because we can create a collection V by considering all smaller elements of M that are less than m_i and add them to the left side of m_i in V.

Define a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant computations:
dp(i, j) = 
    if (i == 0): return 1
    if (j == 0): return 0
    if (dp[i][j] is not None): return dp[i][j]
    result = 0
    for k in range(i+1):
        if (M[k-1] < m_i):
            result += dp(k-1, j-1)
    return (result + 1) % (10**9 + 7)

The function will return the number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1] with value m_i at index i.
