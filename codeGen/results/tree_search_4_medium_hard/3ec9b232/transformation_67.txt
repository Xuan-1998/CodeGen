===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} as a multiset. The number of different ways to create V can be calculated by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed.

Let dp[i][j] be the number of different ways to partition the set {m0, m1, ..., mi} into j subsets such that each subset contains at most i elements. The base case is when j = 0, dp[i][0] = 1 (since there's only one way to create an empty array).

dp[i][j] should represent the number of ways to partition the set {m0, m1, ..., mi} into j subsets such that each subset contains at most i elements.

Let's initialize the base case: dp[0][0] = 1

For the dynamic programming table, fill it up in bottom-up manner from base case (dp[0][0] = 1) to the final solution. We can do this by iterating over all possible values of j and i.

Finally, return dp[n-1][k] as the result, where k is the number of different ways to create V modulo 10^9+7.
