===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} as a multiset. The number of different ways to create V can be calculated by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed.

Let dp[i][j] be the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in an array with elements from [1, i] containing exactly j occurrences of 1. Initialize the base case dp[0][0] = 1.

The state is (i, j) and the transition relationships can be formulated as follows: 
- if m_i-1 < i, then dp[i][j] += dp[m_i-1][j], because the value m_i-1 needs to be shifted forward to reach the range [1, i].
- if m_i-1 >= i, then dp[i][j] += dp[m_i-1][j]., because the value m_i-1 is already in the correct position.

Use a 2D memoization dictionary where dp[(i, j)] represents the number of ways to create a collection V with exactly j occurrences of 1 in an array from [1, i].

Initialize dp[0][0] = 1 and for each m_i-1 < i, calculate dp[i][j] as dp[m_i-1][j]. If m_i-1 >= i, then calculate dp[i][j] as dp[m_i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j]. Finally, return dp[n][0].
