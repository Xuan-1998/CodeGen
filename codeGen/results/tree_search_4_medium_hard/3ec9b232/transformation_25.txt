===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by considering all possible permutations of M. Each permutation corresponds to a unique way of creating V.

Define the state expression and base case as (i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1], with base case being dp(0, 0) = 1 since there is only one way to create an empty collection. This approach ensures that we consider all possible orderings of the elements.

Consider the state as (i, j) where i represents the current element in M and j is the length of the subarray to be sorted.
Employ a one-dimensional array dp of size n+1 to store the dynamic programming table, with dp[i] representing the number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:i].

The transition function for the DP can be defined as follows:

- If i == 0, then there is only one way to create an empty collection (base case), so dp[0] = 1.
- For each i > 0:
    - Initialize count to 0.
    - Iterate over all j from 0 to i, considering the current element M[i] as part of V or not.
        - If M[i] is included in V, then we need to consider all possible orderings for the subarray M[:i-1], so we add dp[j-1] * (i-j) to count.
        - If M[i] is not included in V, then we only need to consider all possible orderings for the subarray M[:i-1], so we add dp[i-1] to count.
    - Update dp[i] = count % (10^9+7).

The final answer would be dp[n].
