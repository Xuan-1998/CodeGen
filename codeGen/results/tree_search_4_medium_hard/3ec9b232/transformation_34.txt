===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by considering all possible permutations of M. Each permutation corresponds to a unique way of creating V.

Define the state expression and base case as (i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1] with value m_i at index i, with base case being dp(n-1, n-1) = 1 since there is exactly one way to arrange the remaining elements.

dp(i, j) represents the number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1] with value m_i at index i, and state transition: dp(i, j) = dp(i-1, j-1) + sum(dp[k, j-1] * (M[k-1] <= m_i)) for k from 0 to i.

Dynamically create a table dp[][] of size (n+1) x (n+1) using nested loops, filling in values from base case to solution. Initialize all values to 0 and set dp(0, j) = 1 for all j, since there is exactly one way to arrange the first element.
