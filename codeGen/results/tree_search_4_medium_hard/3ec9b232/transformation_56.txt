===BEGIN PLAN===
Define dp[n] as the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in array M.

The base case is when n = 0, dp[0] = 1 (since there's only one way to create an empty array).

dp[i] can represent the number of different ways to create a collection V such that the i-th element of M is the maximum value in V.

We can use dynamic programming with bottom-up approach by initializing dp with zeros and updating it according to the recurrence relation: 

dp[i] = sum(dp[j]) * (n - j) for 0 <= j < i, where n is the size of array M. This recurrence relation calculates the number of ways to create V such that the maximum value in V is equal to m_i.

This plan seems correct and comprehensive. However, it's worth noting that there might be some cases where this dynamic programming approach might not be efficient enough or would take too much memory space.
