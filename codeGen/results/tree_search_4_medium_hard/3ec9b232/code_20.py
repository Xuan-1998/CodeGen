===BEGIN PLAN===
We can define a dynamic programming table dp[i][p] where p is a partition of i. The value dp[i][p] represents the minimum number of sets needed to match the first i elements given a specific partition p.

The state transition would consider all possible partitions and update dp[i][p] accordingly. This can be done by iterating over each element from 1 to i and considering all possible subsets that include this element.

To create a recursive function that calculates dp[i][p] using the state transition rules, then apply memoization using a dictionary.

The base case for the recursion would be when i is equal to n, in which case there is only one way to match the partition. We can calculate this by counting the number of subsets in the partition and adding 1 (for the empty subset).

Here's the Python code:
