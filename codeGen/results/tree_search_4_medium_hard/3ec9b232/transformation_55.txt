===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} as a multiset. The number of different ways to create V can be calculated by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed.

Let dp[i][j] be the number of different ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in an array with elements from [1, i] containing exactly j occurrences of 1. The state is (i, j) and the transition relationships can be formulated as follows:

if m_i-1 < i, then dp[i][j] += dp[m_i-1][j]
else if m_i-1 >= i and m_i-1 == j, then dp[i][j] = 1
else if m_i-1 >= i, then dp[i][j] = dp[m_i-1][j]

Use a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to create a collection V for an array from [1, i] containing exactly j occurrences of 1. Then adjust the DP state based on the transitions described in the problem statement.

Let's handle edge cases first: if n == 0 or m0 > n, then return 0

Then calculate dp[0][0] = 1 and fill up the rest of the table using the above transition relationships.

Finally, the answer is the sum of all dp[i][j] where j is the number of occurrences of 1 in M. This will give us the total number of ways to create V, modulo 10^9 + 7.
