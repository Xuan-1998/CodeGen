===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by considering all possible permutations of M. Each permutation corresponds to a unique way of creating V.

Define the state expression and base case as dp(i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1], with base case being dp(0, 0) = 1 since there is only one way to create an empty collection.

Create a dictionary memo where memo[(i, j)] = dp(i, j) and use it to store intermediate results.

To avoid the issue of considering duplicate permutations, for each i, sort M[:i+1] in ascending order and consider only unique permutations. This can be done by creating a set S of numbers from 1 to n and iterating over M to create the sorted array.

Create another dictionary perm where perm[i] = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:i+1], with base case being perm[0] = 1 since there is only one way to create an empty collection. Initialize perm[0] to 1.

Iterate over i from 1 to n-1 and for each i, iterate over j from i to n-1. For each j, calculate the number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1], which is dp(i-1, j) * (number of elements in S[j-i+1..n-1] that are less than or equal to m_j). Add this value to memo[(i, j)].

Finally, return memo[n-1][n-1].
