===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each partition is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

The state is dp[i][j] representing the number of ways to place exactly j 1's in an array of size i, considering all possible partitions.

dp[i][0] = 1 (base case: one way to have no ones)

for i from 1 to n:
    for j from 0 to min(i, j):
        dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][j-1] * (i choose k)) for k from 0 to j

return dp[n][count(M)] modulo 10^9+7
