1. Consider the set {m0, m1, ..., mn-1} as a multiset.
The number of different ways to create V can be calculated by considering all possible multisets that have the same elements as the input multiset but with some repetitions allowed.

2. Let dp[i][j] be the number of different ways to partition the set {m0, m1, ..., mi} into j subsets such that each subset contains at most i elements.
The base case is when j = 0, dp[i][0] = 1 (since there's only one way to create an empty array).

3. dp[i][j] should be equal to the sum of dp[k][l-1]*binomial(i, k) for all k from 1 to i and l from 1 to j.

4. Implement memoization using a cache data structure to store and reuse calculated dp[i][j] values.

5. Initialize the cache with base cases (dp[0][j] = 1 for all j and dp[i][0] = 1 for all i).

6. Fill up the dp table by iterating over i and j and calculating dp[i][j] using the recurrence relation in step 3.

7. The final answer is dp[n][j], where j is the number of subsets you want to create V into.
