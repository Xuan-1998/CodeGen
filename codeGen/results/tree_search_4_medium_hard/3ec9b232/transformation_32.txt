===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by considering all possible permutations of M.

Define the state expression and base case as dp(i, j) = number of ways to create a collection V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M[:j+1] with value m_i at index i, with base case being dp(n-1, n-1) = 0 since there are no more values to consider.

To correctly calculate the state transition, we need to consider all possible permutations of M[:i+1]. For each permutation, count the number of times m_i appears in that permutation. This is represented by dp(k, j-1) * (M[k-1] == m_i). Then sum up these counts for k from 0 to i.

To employ dynamic programming with memoization using a dictionary where the key is the state (i, j) and the value is the number of ways to create V. Initialize an empty dictionary dp.

The initial value should be set as dp(0, -1) = 1, because there's only one way to arrange nothing, which is to have nothing.

Then iterate over i from 0 to n-1, for each i:
    For j from i to n-1, calculate the state transition using the base case and the recursive formula.
    Store this value in dp dictionary.

Finally, return dp(n-1, -1) % (10^9+7), which is the number of ways to create V such that merging V into a sorted array results in M.
