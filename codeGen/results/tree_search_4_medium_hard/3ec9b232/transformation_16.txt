The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each partition is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

Let's define dp[i][p] as the number of ways to match the first i elements with the current partition p, considering all possible partitions of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. We can use dynamic programming to calculate this state.

The base case is when i equals n. In this case, there is only one way to match the entire array M with a single partition that includes all elements.

For other values of i, we need to consider whether the current element is included in the partition or not. If it's not included (i.e., '0' in the binary string), then we can recursively calculate dp[i-1][p] for each possible subset of p that does not include the current element.

If the current element is included (i.e., '1' in the binary string), then we need to consider all possible subsets of p that do include the current element. We can recursively calculate dp[i-1][p'] for each such subset, where p' is the resulting partition after removing the current element from p.

We store the results of these recursive calculations in a memoized function to avoid redundant computations and improve efficiency.

The final result is the sum of dp[n][p] over all possible partitions p, modulo 10^9+7.
