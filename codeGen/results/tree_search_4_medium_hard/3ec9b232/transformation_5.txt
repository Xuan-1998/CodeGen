===BEGIN PLAN===
The number of different ways can be calculated by considering all possible permutations of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Each permutation is represented as a binary string where '0' represents an empty subset and '1' represents a non-empty subset. The number of subsets in each partition determines the final output.

The state is dp[i][j] representing the number of ways to merge an array of size i with exactly j 1's.
dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][x] * dp[n-k-1][y] for k in range(j+1) for x in range(min(j, k)) for y in range(min(n-j-1, n-k-1))),
where the inner loop calculates the number of ways to merge an array of size i into two arrays of sizes k and n-k-1.

Tabulation with a bottom-up approach using a single loop.
Initialize dp[0][0] = 1, since there is only one way to create an empty array.
dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][x] * dp[n-k-1][y] for k in range(j+1) for x in range(min(j, k)) for y in range(min(n-j-1, n-k-1))), for i in range(1, n)

Memoization:
dp[i][j] = memo(dp[0][0], n), where memo is a function that calculates the number of ways to merge an array of size i with exactly j 1's.

Bit manipulation:
Represent each permutation as a binary string using bit manipulation.
Calculate the number of subsets in each partition by counting the number of '1' bits in the binary string.

Edge cases:
Handle edge cases where n = 0 or m_i is out of range.
