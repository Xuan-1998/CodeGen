===BEGIN PLAN===
Since there is a tree structure, one possible choice for identifying overlapping subproblems could be to use DFS (Depth-First Search) to traverse the graph, where each node represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path. This approach would allow us to identify and store intermediate results to avoid redundant computation.

State: dp[i][j][c] represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path from city 0 to city i with j units of gasoline and c units of gas consumed on this edge.

Consider a transition as: if the path from 0 to i has j units of gasoline left and consumes c units of gas on edge (i-1, i), then the next possible states are dp[i-1][j-c][w'] where w' is the minimum of w and w_i for all edges connecting city i-1.

Use a 3D array to store the dynamic programming states, with dimensions n, jmax, and cmax, where n is the number of cities, jmax is the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can carry, and cmax is the maximum gas consumption per edge. For each node, update the state as: dp[i][j][c] = max(dp[i-1][j-c][w']) for all edges connecting city i-1.

Since we are considering a tree structure, there will be no loops in our DFS traversal, and we only need to consider nodes that have been visited before. This ensures that the dynamic programming states do not overlap.

Finally, return dp[n-1][w_n-1][0] as the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path.
