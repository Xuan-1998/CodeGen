State: dp[i][j][c] represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path from city 0 to city i with j units of gasoline and c units of gas consumed on this edge.

Choose a state as (i, j, w) where i is the current city, j is the remaining amount of gasoline, and w is the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can buy at this city.

Implement tabulation. 
For each city, traverse all possible paths from city 0 to this city using DFS.
Calculate the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path by considering all possible choices for the remaining gas stations and road segments.
Use memoization to store the calculated results for faster lookup in future calculations.

Edge cases: 
- The input is guaranteed to be a tree, so no cycles are present. This simplifies the DFS traversal.
- Nut cannot choose a path where he runs out of gasoline, which prevents infinite loops.
