===BEGIN PLAN===
State: dp[i][j] represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path from city 0 to city i with j units of gasoline.

Consider a transition as: if the path from 0 to i has j units of gasoline left and consumes c units of gas on edge (i-1, i), then the next possible states are dp[i-1][min(j-c, w_i)] where w_i is the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can buy in city i.

Implement memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary as you traverse the graph using DFS or BFS. To ensure correctness, make sure to initialize dp[0][w_0] = w_0 and dp[i][j] will be calculated only if j >= 0 and i >= 1.
