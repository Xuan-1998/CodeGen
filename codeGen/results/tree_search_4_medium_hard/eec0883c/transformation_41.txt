===BEGIN PLAN===
The state is defined as (city, gas), where city is an integer representing the current city and gas is the amount of gasoline left.

Let's initialize the dp array with size n, where dp[i] will store the maximum amount of gasoline Nut can have at the end of a path that starts from city 0 and ends at city i.

For each city j (1 <= j <= n-1), we consider all possible previous cities k (0 <= k < j) such that there is an edge from k to j. For each such pair, if the amount of gasoline left in city k is enough to cover the length of the road, and Nut still has some gasoline left after using it for the journey, then we update dp[j] with the maximum value.

The transition happens when we move from one city to another, and the new state would be (new_city, min(total_gas + road_length, max_gas_available)) where total_gas is the total amount of gasoline used so far, road_length is the length of the current road, and max_gas_available is the maximum amount of gasoline available at the current city.

We should sort all roads by their lengths first to avoid using too much gas for a long road. This can be done in O(n log n) time.

Then we iterate over all cities j (1 <= j <= n-1), considering all possible previous cities k (0 <= k < j). For each such pair, if the amount of gasoline left in city k is enough to cover the length of the road, and Nut still has some gasoline left after using it for the journey, then we update dp[j] with the maximum value.

Finally, we return dp[n-1], which represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of a path that starts from city 0 and ends at city n-1.

The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the number of cities. The space complexity is O(n).
