===BEGIN PLAN===
Since there is a tree structure, we can use DFS (Depth-First Search) to traverse the graph, where each node represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path. This approach would allow us to identify and store intermediate results to avoid redundant computation.

State: dp[i] is the minimum remaining gas for node i, considering all possible paths to reach node i. The base case is when there's no road connecting two cities.

One possible approach is to maintain a stack of cities and as we traverse the graph, keep track of the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at each city by updating dp[i] based on the gas available at node i and the minimum remaining gas from its child nodes. We can use memoization by maintaining a dictionary that maps each node to its corresponding maximum gas amount, avoiding redundant computation.

To avoid running out of gas, we'll iterate through all possible paths from the starting city to the destination city and update dp[i] accordingly. This ensures that we don't choose a path where Nut runs out of gasoline.

The plan can be improved by considering edge cases such as:
- When the starting city has more gas than the destination city, it's better to start at the destination city instead.
- In case there are multiple paths with equal maximum amount of gas, choose the one that ends at the earliest possible node to minimize redundant computation.
