===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming and flow network modeling.

We start by creating a graph with n nodes representing cities. Each node has two edges: an edge to its parent city (if it's not the root) and an edge to itself for buying gas at that city.

The state of each node is the maximum amount of gas Nut can have after visiting all preceding cities, considering only roads with non-zero capacity. The base case is when we've visited all nodes, meaning we're back at the starting city.

We use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to build up the state from the root city to each intermediate city. For each node, we consider the maximum gas Nut can get by visiting its parent city and buying some gas there, subtracting the road length from the total capacity, then adding the remaining gas at that city.

The final answer is the maximum possible flow from the starting city to the ending city, considering only edges with non-zero capacity.
