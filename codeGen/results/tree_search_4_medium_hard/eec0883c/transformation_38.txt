===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach, we can start by defining the state and transitions:

* State: (city, gas) where city is an integer representing the current city and gas is the amount of gasoline left.
* Transition: When we move from one city to another, the new state would be (new_city, min(remaining_gas - road_length, max_gas_available))

We can design a function dp[i][j] that represents the maximum amount of gasoline Nut can have at the end of the path starting from city i with j units of gasoline. The base case is when we are at the leaf node, and the transition happens when we move from one city to another.

The dynamic programming table would be filled in as follows:

* For each city i, we iterate over all possible amounts of gasoline 0 <= gas <= max_gas_available
* For each amount of gasoline gas, we update dp[i][gas] with the maximum value between:
	+ The current value dp[i-1][min(gas - road_length, max_gas_available)], where i-1 is the previous city
	+ The current value dp[i-1][max_gas_available], if the remaining gasoline would be less than 0

The final answer would be dp[0][w_1], where w_1 is the maximum amount of gasoline available at the starting city.
