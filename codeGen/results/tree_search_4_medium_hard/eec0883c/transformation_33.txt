===BEGIN PLAN===
We can solve this problem using dynamic programming with a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at city i after visiting j cities. 
The base case is when we are at the start, and we visit no cities, in which case we can take all the gas available at the starting city. 

For each city i, we consider two possibilities: either we visit this city or not. If we do visit it, then we update dp[i][j] as the maximum of the current amount of gas minus the distance to the next city (if there is one), and 0. 
If we don't visit it, then we just copy the value from the previous city.

Finally, we return dp[n-1][n-1], where n is the total number of cities.
