===BEGIN PLAN===
Create a 2D table where the rows represent the cities and the columns represent the maximum amount of gasoline Nut can carry. Initialize the first row with the values from the input representing the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can buy in each city.

Iterate through the road system described by the input, considering each edge $(u,v,c)$ separately:

- For a given edge, check if traveling from $u$ to $v$ would cause Nut's current location and the remaining cities to visit to exceed the maximum amount of gasoline. If not, update the table for city $v$ as follows:
    - Calculate the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path by considering the minimum between the current maximum amount and the remaining capacity after traveling the edge $(u,v,c)$. This would be equivalent to updating the table using a dynamic programming approach.

Repeat this process for all edges in the graph, ensuring that the table is updated only when it makes sense (i.e., when traveling from $u$ to $v$ doesn't cause Nut's current location and the remaining cities to visit to exceed the maximum amount of gasoline).

The final entry in the last column represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path, which is the answer.
