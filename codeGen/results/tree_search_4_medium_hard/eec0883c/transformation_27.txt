===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by modeling it as a flow network with unit capacities, where each edge has a capacity equal to the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can buy in each city. The goal is to find the maximum flow from one city to another.

The state can be represented as the maximum possible flow from the starting city to the current city, considering only edges with non-zero capacity. The base case is when all cities have been visited.

Let dp[i][j] be the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path from city i to city j. Initialize a 2D array dp[0..n-1][0..n-1] with zeros, where n is the number of cities.

For each edge (u, v) in the graph, if there is no more gasoline left, set dp[u][v] = 0. Otherwise, it's equal to the minimum of the remaining gasoline at city u and the maximum amount of gasoline that can be used on this edge.

The final answer is dp[0][n-1].
