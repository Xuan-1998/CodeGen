===BEGIN PLAN===
Model this problem as a longest path problem on an acyclic graph, where each node represents a city and the edges represent the roads between cities, and the goal is to find the longest path that does not exceed the maximum amount of gasoline.

Consider all possible paths from the starting city to any other city. For each such path, calculate the maximum amount of gasoline Nut can have at the end of the path by considering the road lengths and the remaining gasoline at each step.

Use dynamic programming to store the maximum amounts of gasoline for each subpath in an array dp[i][j], where i is the index of the current city, and j is the maximum amount of gasoline that can be used up to this point. The base case will be when we are at the starting city or when there's no more gasoline.

To fill up the dp table, iterate over all possible paths from the starting city to each other city. For each path, calculate the maximum amount of gasoline that can be achieved by considering the road length and the remaining gasoline. The maximum of these values will be the answer for this subproblem.

Finally, return the value at the last cell of the dp table, which represents the maximum amount of gasoline Nut can have at the end of the path.
