===BEGIN PLAN===
The original plan is correct in recognizing that this problem can be solved using dynamic programming and DFS traversal.

However, there are some issues with the plan:

1. The state representation dp[i][j][c] is not well-defined, as it does not take into account the amount of gasoline available at each city.
2. The transition function is not clearly defined, and it seems that the minimum of w and w_i for all edges connecting city i-1 is taken without considering the amount of gasoline consumed on edge (i-1, i).

Here's an updated version of the plan:
