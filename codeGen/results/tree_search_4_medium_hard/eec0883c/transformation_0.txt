Since there is a tree structure, one possible choice for identifying overlapping subproblems could be to use DFS (Depth-First Search) to traverse the graph, where each node represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path. This approach would allow us to identify and store intermediate results to avoid redundant computation.

State: dp[i][j] represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path from city 0 to city i with j units of gasoline.

To use a bottom-up approach, consider defining dp[i][j] as the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path from city 0 to city i with j units of gasoline. The state transition relationship could be based on the idea that if Nut has enough gasoline to reach city i, he can choose any road segment connecting city i-1 and city i to further decrease his gas level. This would involve subtracting the length of each road segment from j to get the new gas level.

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path from city 0 to city i with j units of gasoline. Initialize dp[0][w_i] = w_i, where w_i is the maximum amount of gasoline available in each city.

For each road segment (u, v, c), calculate the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path from city 0 to city u with j units of gasoline. This would be dp[u][j]. Then, calculate the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path from city 0 to city v with (j - c) units of gasoline. This would be dp[v][j - c].

Finally, update dp[v][j] as the maximum between dp[v][j] and the minimum of dp[u][max_j] and (dp[u][max_j] - c), where max_j is the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path from city 0 to city u with j units of gasoline.

Return dp[n-1][j] as the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path.
