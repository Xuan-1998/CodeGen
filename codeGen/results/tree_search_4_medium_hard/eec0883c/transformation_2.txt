===BEGIN PLAN===
Since there is a tree structure, one possible choice for identifying overlapping subproblems could be to use DFS (Depth-First Search) to traverse the graph, where each node represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path. This approach would allow us to identify and store intermediate results to avoid redundant computation.

State: dp[i][j] represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path from city 0 to city i with j units of gasoline.

To use a bottom-up approach, consider defining dp[i][j] as the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path from city 0 to city i with j units of gasoline. The state transition relationship could be based on the idea that if Nut has enough gasoline to reach city i, he can choose any road segment connecting city i-1 and city i to further decrease his gas level. This would involve subtracting the length of each road segment from j to get the new gas level.

Implement memoization by defining a dictionary dp where dp[(i, j)] represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path from city 0 to city i with j units of gasoline.

Initialize dp[0][j] as w[j], which is the initial gas level in each city. 

For each road segment connecting city i-1 and city i, calculate the new gas level for reaching city i by subtracting the length c from j if Nut has enough gas to reach city i. If he doesn't have enough gas, set dp[i][j] as 0.

Update dp[i][j] based on the maximum of the previous state and the new state calculated above.

Return dp[n-1][j_max], where n-1 is the last city in the path and j_max is the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path.
