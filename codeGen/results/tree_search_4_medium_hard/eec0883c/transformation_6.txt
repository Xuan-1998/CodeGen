===BEGIN PLAN===
Using DFS with memoization can be an effective approach for this problem. Here's an updated and refined plan:

State: dp[i][j] represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path from city 0 to city i with j units of gasoline.

1. Initialize dp[0][w_0] = w_0, where w_0 is the initial gas level in city 0.
2. Perform DFS on the graph:
    * For each city i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), consider its children c.
    * Iterate over each road segment (c, d) connecting cities c and d:
        + If Nut has j units of gasoline, update dp[c][j] = max(dp[c][j], min(w_c, w_d - c)) to account for the gas level in city d being reduced by the length of the road.
        + Recursively compute dp[d][k] for k ranging from 0 to min(j, w_d - c) and update dp[d][k] = max(dp[d][k], dp[c][j-k]).
3. Return dp[n-1][dp[n-1].index(max(dp[n-1]))] as the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path.

This plan addresses the potential issue of overlapping subproblems by storing intermediate results and reusing them in the recursive computation.
