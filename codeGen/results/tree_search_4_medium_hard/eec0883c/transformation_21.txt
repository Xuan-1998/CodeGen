===BEGIN PLAN===
Since there is a tree structure, one possible choice for identifying overlapping subproblems could be to use DFS (Depth-First Search) to traverse the graph, where each node represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path. This approach would allow us to identify and store intermediate results to avoid redundant computation.

State: dp[i][j][c] represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path from city 0 to city i with j units of gasoline and c units of gas consumed on this edge.

Use a state as (i, j) where i is the current city, j is the remaining amount of gasoline, and define a transition as: if the path from 0 to i has j units of gasoline left and consumes c units of gas on edge (i-1, i), then the next possible states are dp[i-1][j-c] and dp[i-1][j].

Implement a memoization function using Python's built-in functools module to memoize the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path from city 0 to each city i.

For edge cases, consider the situation where there is only one city. In this case, the maximum amount of gasoline would be w_1 (the initial amount of gasoline).
