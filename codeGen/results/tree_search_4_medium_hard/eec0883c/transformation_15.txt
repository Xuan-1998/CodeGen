===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the graph and identify overlapping subproblems by storing intermediate results.

State: dp[i] is the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have when he is in city i.
The base case is when there's no road connecting two cities. In this case, the maximum amount of gasoline is simply the initial amount at the starting city.

Step 1:
- Start from the starting city and perform DFS to traverse the graph.
- At each node (city), calculate the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have by considering the current gas level and the remaining road length.
- Store this value in dp[i] as we go along.

Step 2:
- When traversing an edge between two cities, update dp[j] with the minimum of its current value and dp[i] - (gas station capacity at city i).
- This ensures that Nut can only travel if he has enough gas to cover the road length.
- If Nut runs out of gas before reaching the end of the road, set dp[j] to 0.

Step 3:
- Return the maximum value in dp[] as the answer.

This plan takes into account edge cases by considering the initial gas level and the remaining road length at each node. It also avoids redundant computation by storing intermediate results.
