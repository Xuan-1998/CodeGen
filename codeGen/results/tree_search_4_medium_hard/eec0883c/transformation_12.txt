===BEGIN PLAN===
Since there is a tree structure, one possible choice for identifying overlapping subproblems could be to use DFS (Depth-First Search) to traverse the graph, where each node represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end. This approach would allow us to identify and store intermediate results to avoid redundant computation.

State: dp[i] is the minimum remaining gas for node i, and base case is when there's no road connecting two cities.

One possible approach is to maintain a stack of cities and as we traverse the graph, keep track of the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at each city. 

Using dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach, where dp[i] represents the maximum amount of gasoline Nut can have after visiting node i. For each node i, calculate the minimum remaining gas by considering the gas available in city i and subtracting the length of roads from previous cities to i.

Then, update dp[i] as the maximum of dp[i] and the minimum remaining gas for all adjacent nodes j that are connected to i. This ensures we don't run out of gas when traveling between two cities. 

The plan also considers the constraint that Nut cannot choose a path where he runs out of gasoline by ensuring dp[i] is always greater than or equal to 0.
