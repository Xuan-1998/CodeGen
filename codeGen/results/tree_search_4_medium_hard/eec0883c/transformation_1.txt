===BEGIN PLAN===
Using DFS (Depth-First Search) to traverse the graph, where each node represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path.
State: dp[i][j] represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path from city 0 to city i with j units of gasoline.

The state transition relationship could be based on the idea that if Nut has enough gasoline to reach city i, he can choose any road segment connecting city i-1 and city i to further decrease his gas level. This would involve subtracting the length of each road segment from j to get the new gas level.

Use dynamic programming by iterating over all possible gas levels and cities, using previous computed values to avoid redundant computation.

For each city i:
  For each possible gas level j:
    If j >= w_i (the current city's gasoline limit), update dp[i][j] as max(dp[i-1][j-w_i], ...); // explore all roads connecting city i-1 and city i
    Else, update dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]; // no road available to decrease gas level

Return dp[n-1][w_n-1]
