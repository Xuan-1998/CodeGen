===BEGIN PLAN===
If we look at it from a purely graph-theoretic perspective, a third possible choice could be to model this problem as a longest path problem on an acyclic graph, where each node represents a city and the edges represent the roads between cities, and the goal is to find the longest path that does not exceed the maximum amount of gasoline.
The state is defined as a pair (city, gas), where city is an integer representing the city Nut is at, and gas is the amount of gasoline left.

State could be (city, remaining_gas) where city is an integer representing the current city and remaining_gas is the amount of gasoline left. 
Transition happens when we move from one city to another, and the new state would be (new_city, min(remaining_gas - road_length, max_gas_available))

Create a dictionary dp to store the memoized values, where the key is a tuple representing the city and the remaining gas amount, and the value is the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path.

For each edge from u to v with length c, update dp[u][remaining_gas] = max(dp[u][remaining_gas], dp[v][min(max_gas_available - c, remaining_gas)])

Finally, return dp[0][max_gas_available]
