===BEGIN PLAN===
We can solve this problem using DFS with memoization. The main idea is to maintain a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum amount of gasoline Nut can have at city i, assuming he has j units left. This state captures the information we need to decide which road to take next.

State: dp[i][j], where i is the city and j is the remaining gas.
Base case: When there's no road connecting two cities, then Nut cannot buy any more gas, so dp[i][0] = 0 for all i.

Function: dfs(i, j) returns the maximum amount of gasoline Nut can have at city i, assuming he has j units left. The function takes into account the roads that connect city i to its neighbors and updates the state accordingly.

Memoization is used to store the results of subproblems so we don't compute them multiple times.

The main loop iterates over all cities, and for each city, it calls dfs(i, w_i) where w_i is the maximum amount of gasoline available at city i. The function returns the maximum amount of gasoline Nut can have at that city.
