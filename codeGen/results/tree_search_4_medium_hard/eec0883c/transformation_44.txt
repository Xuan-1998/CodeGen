===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] = maximum gasoline available if we are at city i with j amount of gasoline left
The state is defined as a pair (city, gas), where city is an integer representing the city Nut is at, and gas is the amount of gasoline left.
State could be dp[i][j] where i is an integer representing the city Nut is at, and j is the amount of gasoline left.
Transition happens when we move from one city to another, and the new state would be dp[u][min(dp[v][k], w_v - c)] if we choose road (u, v) with length c
If you want to be fancy, use a priority queue to keep track of the cities that need to be processed based on the amount of gasoline available.
The final answer would be max(dp[n-1][j]) for all 0 <= j <= w_n
