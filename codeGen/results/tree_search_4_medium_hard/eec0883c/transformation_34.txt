===BEGIN PLAN===
If we look at it from a purely graph-theoretic perspective, a third possible choice could be to model this problem as a longest path problem on an acyclic graph, where each node represents a city and the edges represent the roads between cities, and the goal is to find the longest path that does not exceed the maximum amount of gasoline. This would allow us to apply standard techniques for solving longest path problems.

Let's break down the state space:
- The current location (city) Nut is at
- The remaining cities to visit

We can represent this using a single state variable.

Apply memoization using a recursive function that stores the results of subproblems in a dictionary. This will help avoid redundant computations and speed up the solution.

For each city, calculate the maximum amount of gasoline Nut can have by considering all possible paths from the previous cities to the current one. For each path, update the maximum gasoline accordingly.

We need to handle edge cases:
- If there's only one city left, return the remaining gasoline
- If we've reached a city with no roads connected, return the maximum amount of gasoline that can be purchased in that city

This plan should work correctly and efficiently. It takes into account all possible paths and considers the constraints on gasoline and road lengths.
