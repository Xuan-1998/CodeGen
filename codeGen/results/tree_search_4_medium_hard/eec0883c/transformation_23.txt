===BEGIN PLAN===
A flow network with unit capacities can be used to model this problem. The graph has n+2 vertices (n cities and 2 special nodes: source and sink). Each edge represents a road from one city to another, and its capacity is equal to the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can buy in each city. The goal is to find the maximum flow from the source to the sink.

The state can be represented as the maximum possible flow from the source to the current vertex, considering only edges with non-zero capacity. The base case is when all cities have been visited.

Applying memoization by storing and reusing previously computed values for the maximum flow from the source to each intermediate city.

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use Dinic's algorithm or Edmonds-Karp algorithm as it is a special case of a flow network with unit capacities. We need to ensure that there are no negative cycles in the residual graph.
