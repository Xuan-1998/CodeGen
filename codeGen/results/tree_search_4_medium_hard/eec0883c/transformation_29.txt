==BEGIN PLAN==
The state can be represented as the maximum possible flow from the starting city to the current city, considering only edges with non-zero capacity. The base case is when all cities have been visited.

Let dp[i] be the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at city i.
For each edge (u, v) with w_v - w_u > 0:
    If there's a path from u to v in the residual graph, then let f be the minimum capacity on this path. Add f to dp[v]. Subtract f from dp[u].
Return dp[n-1], where n is the total number of cities.

The state can also be represented as the amount of gasoline that Nut has at the current city, considering only edges with non-zero capacity.
Let dp[i] be the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at city i.
For each edge (u, v) with w_v - w_u > 0:
    If there's a path from u to v in the residual graph, then let f be the minimum capacity on this path. Add f to dp[v]. Subtract f from dp[u].
Return max(dp), where dp is an array of all the dp values.

Applying top-down memoization by defining a function that solves the problem and storing previously computed solutions in a dictionary.
