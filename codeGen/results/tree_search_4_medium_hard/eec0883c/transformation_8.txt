===BEGIN PLAN===
We will use a bottom-up approach with tabulation to solve this problem. Let's define dp[i] as the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path from city 0 to city i.

The state transition relationship is based on iteratively updating dp[i] using the maximum gas levels of its children and the length of the road segments connecting them.

We will start by initializing dp[0] with w_1, which represents the initial amount of gasoline Nut can buy in city 1. Then, we will iterate through each node i from 2 to n-1:

For each node i:
    For each child j of node i (i.e., a node that is connected to i by an edge):
        Calculate dp[i] as the maximum of two possibilities:
            1. Nut doesn't go through this road segment: dp[i] = max(dp[j], w_i - c)
            2. Nut goes through this road segment, but only if he has enough gas: dp[i] = min(dp[j] + c, w_i)

Finally, the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path is dp[n-1].
