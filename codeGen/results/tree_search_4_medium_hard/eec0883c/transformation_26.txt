===BEGIN PLAN===
The state can be represented as the maximum possible flow from the starting city to the current city, considering only edges with non-zero capacity.

The base case is when all cities have been visited.

The state can be a tuple of (city, remaining_gasoline), where the remaining_gasoline is updated based on the maximum gasoline that Nut can buy in each city and the length of the roads connecting to the current city.

Apply memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary and checking if a result is already computed before computing it again. When computing a result, iterate over all cities and for each city, calculate the maximum flow considering only edges with non-zero capacity. This can be done using dynamic programming where dp[i] represents the maximum gasoline that Nut can have at the end of a simple path from the starting city to city i.

The final answer will be the value of dp[n-1], where n is the number of cities.
