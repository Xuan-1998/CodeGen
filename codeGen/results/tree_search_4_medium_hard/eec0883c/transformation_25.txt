===BEGIN PLAN===
We can model this problem as a flow network with unit capacities, where each edge has a capacity equal to the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can buy in each city.

The state can be represented as the maximum possible flow from the starting city to the current city, considering only edges with non-zero capacity. The base case is when all cities have been visited.

The state can be a tuple of (city, remaining_gasoline), where the remaining_gasoline is updated based on the maximum gasoline that Nut can buy in each city and the length of the roads connecting to the current city.

Use a 2D table to store the state of the dynamic programming problem, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path from city i to city j.

For each edge (u, v) with capacity c, update the states as follows:

* If u is the starting city, set dp[u][v] = min(dp[u][u], c)
* For each neighbor w of v not visited yet:
	+ Update dp[w][v] = max(dp[w][w], dp[v][w] - c)
	+ Recursively update dp[w][i] for all cities i reachable from w
* Return the maximum value in the table, which represents the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can have at the end of the path.

This plan seems correct and should work efficiently to solve the problem.
