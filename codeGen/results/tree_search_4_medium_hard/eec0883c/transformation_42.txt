===BEGIN PLAN===
If we look at it from a purely graph-theoretic perspective, a third possible choice could be to model this problem as a longest path problem on an acyclic graph, where each node represents a city and the edges represent the roads between cities, and the goal is to find the longest path that does not exceed the maximum amount of gasoline.

The state is defined as a pair (city, gas), where city is an integer representing the city Nut is at, and gas is the amount of gasoline left. This can be improved by considering only the cities that are reachable from the current city within the available gasoline.

State could be (path_length, remaining_gas) where path_length is an integer representing the length of the current path and remaining_gas is the amount of gasoline left. The transition happens when we move from one city to another, and the new state would be (new_path_length, min(remaining_gas - road_length, max_gas_available))

The plan can be further improved by considering only the edges that do not exceed the available gasoline.

Use a 2D array dp[][] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum amount of gasoline Nut can have at city i with j units of gasoline left. The state transition would be:

dp[u][k] = max(dp[v][min(k - road_length, w_v)], k)

The plan includes edge cases by considering the initial and terminal cities.
