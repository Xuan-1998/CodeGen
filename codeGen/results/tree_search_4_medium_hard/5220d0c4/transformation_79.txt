===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the beauty value of a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime.

Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using the previously computed values.
Consider two possibilities: either the last element in the subarray is a good prime or not.

State Transition:
- If the last element in the subarray is a good prime, then consider the maximum beauty of the subarray without this element and add the beauty value corresponding to a good prime.
- If the last element in the subarray is not a good prime, then consider the maximum beauty of the subarray without this element and subtract the beauty value corresponding to a bad prime.

The initial state for each cell is 0. The final answer will be the value at the bottom-right corner of the table.

This plan takes into account all edge cases, such as an empty array or when there are no bad primes.
