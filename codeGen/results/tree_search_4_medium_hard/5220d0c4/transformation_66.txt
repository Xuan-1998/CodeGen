===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the beauty value of a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime.
Define the state expression as the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray, whether it's good or bad prime number, and the maximum beauty obtained so far for subarrays with same minimum prime divisor. The base case is the beauty value of an empty subarray, which is 0.

View the state as a tuple (p, g) where p is the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and g is whether it's good or bad prime. Initialize the table with all zeros.

Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using the previously computed values. For each cell, consider all possible states (p, g) that can be obtained by adding a new element to the end of the subarray and update the value if it's larger than the current value in the table.

The beauty value of a subarray ending at index i is the maximum beauty obtained so far for subarrays with same minimum prime divisor and whether it's good or bad prime.

Use a 2D table where the number of rows is equal to the size of the array and the number of columns is equal to the maximum possible good prime number. The cell at row i and column j represents the beauty value of the subarray ending at index i with the minimum prime divisor being j.
