===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem. This approach uses memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The state expression could be defined as a tuple (i, j) representing the range [0, i] in the array and the set of bad prime numbers up to j.

The state could be a 4-tuple (i, j, k, flag) where:
    i is the index in the array
    j is the current element being processed
    k is the number of good primes in the range [0, i]
    flag is an indicator for whether it's a good or bad prime

Create a 3D DP table to store beauty values based on the range [0, i] in the array, the set of bad prime numbers up to j, and whether it's a good or bad prime.

The base case could be when i = 0 or the range is empty. The maximum beauty would be 0 in this case.

The recurrence relation could be: 
    If the current element is a good prime:
        let new_k = k + 1
        return max(dp[i-1][j][k+1][True], dp[i-1][j][k][False] + (i-j)*flag)
    Else if the current element is a bad prime and flag is True:
        return dp[i-1][j][k][True]
    Else: 
        let new_k = k
        return max(dp[i-1][j][k][False], dp[i-1][j][k+1][True] + (i-j)*flag)

The answer would be the maximum value in the DP table.
