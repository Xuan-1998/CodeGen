===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is defined by combining the beauty values of non-overlapping subarrays. Consider the maximum beauty value for all possible combinations of good and bad primes. Use memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The state expression is a 4-tuple (i, j, f, g) representing the current window [0, i] with flags f indicating whether to consider bad primes or not and g indicating whether the last element is good or not.

Consider all possible combinations of good and bad primes for each subarray, where the beauty value is determined by whether it contains a bad prime. Initialize dp[0][j][f][g] as -1 for all j and f.

The dynamic programming algorithm uses a 4D array dp with dimensions (n+1) x (m+1) x 2 x 2, where dp[i][j][f][g] represents the maximum beauty value for the subarray [0, i] considering bad primes up to the jth bad prime and whether the last element is good or not. The final answer is stored in dp[n][m][0][1].
