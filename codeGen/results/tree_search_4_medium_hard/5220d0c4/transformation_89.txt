===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell dp[i][j] represents the beauty value of a subarray ending at index i with the last element being a good prime if j is odd and a bad prime if j is even. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime.

Create a 2D table where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum beauty value for the subarray ending at index i with the last element being a good prime if j is odd and a bad prime if j is even.
If the last element in the subarray is a good prime, increment it by 1 and set dp[i][j+1] to be the maximum between the current beauty value and the beauty value of the subarray ending at index i-1 with the last element being a bad prime. If the last element is a bad prime, set dp[i][j+1] to be the maximum between the current beauty value and the beauty value of the subarray ending at index i-1 with the last element being a good prime.

Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using the previously computed values.
