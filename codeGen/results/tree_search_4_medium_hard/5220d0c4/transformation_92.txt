===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D array where each cell represents the maximum beauty value of a subarray ending at that index and considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray. The state transition relationship is defined by considering whether the minimum prime divisor is a good or bad prime.

Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using previously computed values. Consider two possibilities for each cell: either the last element in the subarray is a good prime or not.

Initialize the first row with 0s since there are no elements in an empty subarray. Iterate through the array and update each cell based on the minimum prime divisor of the current element and whether it's a good or bad prime. Use memoization to avoid recomputing values by looking up previously computed values.

Update the maximum beauty value seen so far when updating each cell.
