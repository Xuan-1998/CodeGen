===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the beauty value of a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime. Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using the previously computed values.

Consider two possibilities: either the last element in the subarray is a good prime or not.

Transition Relationship:
    - If the last element is a good prime, its beauty value will be increased by 1.
    - If the last element is not a good prime and it has no bad primes as divisors, its beauty value remains the same.
    - If the last element is not a good prime and it has at least one bad prime as a divisor, its beauty value decreases by 1.

Implement memoization by storing and retrieving previously computed values in a dictionary.
