===BEGIN PLAN===
State: The minimum prime divisor of each element in the subset, and whether it is a bad prime or not.

Identifying overlapping subproblems:
For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem.
The base case could be the beauty value for an empty array or when all elements in the array are bad primes. In this case, the beauty value would be 0 because there are no good primes.

To calculate the maximum beauty of the array, we need to consider two cases:
- Case 1: The first element is a good prime.
In this case, we can combine it with all elements that have the same minimum prime divisor. This will increase the beauty value by 1.
- Case 2: The first element is a bad prime.
In this case, we need to consider the maximum beauty of the subarray excluding the first element.

Create a table dp[i][j] where:
dp[i][j] = Maximum beauty that can be obtained considering the first i elements and the last j elements are good primes.
The base cases would be:
- For an empty array (i=0), the beauty value is 0 for any number of bad primes.
- For all bad primes in the array, the beauty value is equal to the number of good primes.

Then, iterate over the array and fill up the table. The maximum beauty can be found by considering all possible cases at each step:
- If the current element is a good prime, we need to consider two cases: including it or not.
- If the current element is a bad prime, we can only ignore it.
