===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is defined by combining the beauty values of non-overlapping subarrays. Consider the maximum beauty value for all possible combinations of good and bad primes. Use memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The state expression is a 4-tuple (i, j, f, b) representing the current window [i, j] with flags f indicating whether to consider bad primes or not, and flag b indicating whether the last prime considered was good or bad.

Define states as pairs (i, j, f, b) representing windows [i, j], flags for considering bad primes, and flags for the last considered prime. Transition relationships are based on whether the current number is a good prime or a bad prime. For each state, calculate the beauty value by considering all possible combinations of good and bad primes.

Use memoization with a dictionary to store previously computed beauty values based on the window index, flag for considering bad primes, and flag for the last considered prime.

For edge cases, consider handling when i is 0 or j is n-1 separately. Also, consider adding checks to handle when the current number is not a prime number.
