===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the maximum beauty value of a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime.

Create a 2D table of size (n+1) x m, where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum beauty value for the subarray ending at index i with the last element being a good prime if j is even and a bad prime if j is odd.

Fill the first row of the table by iterating over each element in the array from left to right. For each element, consider two possibilities: either it's a good or bad prime.

For each possibility, calculate the minimum prime divisor of the current element and whether it's a good or bad prime. Update the corresponding cell in the table with the maximum beauty value based on this consideration.

Fill the rest of the table by iterating over each row from top to bottom. For each cell, consider two possibilities: either the last element in the subarray is a good or bad prime.

For each possibility, calculate the minimum prime divisor of the current element and whether it's a good or bad prime. Update the corresponding cell in the table with the maximum beauty value based on this consideration.

The maximum beauty value of the entire array is stored in the bottom-right cell of the table.
