===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem. This approach uses memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

Base case: The beauty value for an empty array or when all elements in the array are bad primes is 0.

Next state: Determine the next state by considering all possible subsets that can be obtained by adding one more number to the current subset. This involves iterating over each element, and for each element, consider all possible subsets that include this element.

Create a 2D table where each cell represents the maximum beauty of an array with a given length and set of bad prime numbers.

For each cell in the table, calculate the maximum beauty value by considering two options: 
- Add the current element to the subset and update the beauty value accordingly.
- Do not add the current element to the subset and stick with the previous beauty value.

The updated plan is as follows:
