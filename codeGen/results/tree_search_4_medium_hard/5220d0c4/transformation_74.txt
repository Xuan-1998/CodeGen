===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the beauty value of a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime.

Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using previously computed values.

Consider two possibilities: either the last element in the subarray is a good prime or not.

For each element in the array:

* If the current element is a good prime:
  + Add its minimum prime divisor to the current beauty value.
* If the current element is not a good prime:
  + Subtract its minimum prime divisor from the current beauty value.

Implement memoization using a dictionary where keys are tuples representing the current subarray and the previous element's status (good or bad), and values are the computed beauty value. This way, you can avoid redundant computations and optimize the solution.

Use dynamic programming to fill the table iteratively, considering previously computed values for each cell.

Fill the table until all possible subarrays have been processed.
