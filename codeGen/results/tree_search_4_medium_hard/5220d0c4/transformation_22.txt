===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem. This approach uses memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

A possible state expression could be the current element i and the maximum beauty achieved so far, considering all previous elements up to i-1.

View each element as having two possible states: either it's included in the combination with its previous minimum prime divisor or it's not. The transition relationships can be formulated based on whether the new element's minimum prime divisor is different from the current one, considering all previous elements up to i-1.

Formulate a recursive function that takes the current element, its minimum prime divisor, and the maximum beauty achieved so far as input parameters, and returns the maximum beauty achievable by including or excluding the current element.

Define the base case: When there's only one element in the array, the maximum beauty is simply the value of that element. This will serve as a starting point for the recursive function.

The recursive function can then be implemented using memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems. This ensures that each subproblem is only solved once, preventing redundant computation and improving efficiency.

To handle edge cases, consider what happens when the array contains no elements or has a single element. In both cases, the maximum beauty would simply be 0 or the value of the single element, respectively.

The plan seems to be correct, but it's essential to ensure that the recursive function is implemented correctly and efficiently, considering potential issues such as exceeding the recursion limit or causing stack overflow.
