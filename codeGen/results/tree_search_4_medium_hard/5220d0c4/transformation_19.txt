===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem.

A possible state expression could be the current element i and the maximum beauty achieved so far, considering all previous elements up to i-1. This approach uses memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

Consider two states: (i, m) representing the beauty value for elements from 0 to i and the maximum beauty achieved considering all previous elements up to i-1; and (j, k) for elements from j to i, where k is the minimum prime divisor of the elements in this range. Transition between these states occurs when the minimum prime divisor changes or if a bad prime number is encountered.

Implement memoization using a dictionary where the key is the state (i, m) or (j, k) and the value is the corresponding beauty value.

Use dynamic programming to fill up the memoization table in bottom-up manner. Start from the first element of the array and recursively compute the beauty values for all possible subarrays. When a state has been computed before, return the stored value instead of recomputing it.
