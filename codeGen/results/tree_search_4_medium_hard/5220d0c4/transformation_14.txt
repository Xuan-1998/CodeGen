===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem. This approach uses memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.
The base case could be the beauty value for an empty array or when all elements in the array are bad primes. In this case, the beauty value would be the number of good primes in the array.
To determine the next state, consider all possible subsets that can be obtained by adding one more number to the current subset. For each subset, calculate its beauty value and store it in the memoization table.
The maximum beauty value is then determined by taking the maximum beauty value for all possible subsets.
Implement memoization by using a recursive function that checks if the beauty value for a given subproblem has already been computed before calculating it.
