===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the beauty value of a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime.

Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using the previously computed values.

Consider two possibilities: either the last element in the subarray is a good prime or not:

* If the last element is a good prime:
	+ Calculate the beauty value of the subarray by considering the minimum prime divisor and whether it's a good or bad prime.
	+ Store this value in the table cell corresponding to the current subarray.

* If the last element is not a good prime:
	+ Calculate the beauty value of the subarray by considering the minimum prime divisor and whether it's a good or bad prime.
	+ Store this value in the table cell corresponding to the current subarray.

Calculate the maximum beauty value by scanning the bottom-right corner of the table and returning the maximum value found.
