===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is defined by combining the beauty values of non-overlapping subarrays. Consider the maximum beauty value for all possible combinations of good and bad primes.

Let dp[i][j] be the maximum beauty value for the window [0, i] when considering good or bad primes up to j.

Define states as tuples (i, f) representing windows [0, i] with a flag f indicating whether to consider bad primes or not. States are updated based on the last number in the window, which is either good or bad.

Transition relationships:

* If the current number is good and we don't care about bad primes, update dp[i][f+1] using the maximum beauty value for the previous window [0, i-1].
* If the current number is bad and we do care about bad primes, update dp[i][j] using the minimum of two possibilities:
	+ The maximum beauty value for the previous window [0, i-1] without considering this bad prime.
	+ The maximum beauty value for the previous window [0, i-1] with this bad prime added to the list.

Edge cases:

* Handle the base case where i = 0. Initialize dp[0][j] as 0 for all j.

Improved plan: 
Consider pre-computing all primes up to the maximum array element and storing them in a set or hash table. This can help speed up the transition relationships by reducing the time complexity of checking whether a number is prime.
