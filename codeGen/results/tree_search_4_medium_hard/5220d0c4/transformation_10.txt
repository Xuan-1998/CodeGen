Identifying overlapping subproblems: We can consider the minimum prime divisor of each element in the array as a key for memoization. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem. This approach uses dynamic programming to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The base case could be the beauty value for an empty array or when all elements in the array are bad primes. In this case, the beauty value would be 0, as there are no good primes in the array.

State: The minimum prime divisor of each element in the subset, and whether it is a good or bad prime.

Implement memoization using a dictionary to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems. This can help avoid redundant computations and improve the efficiency of the solution.

Dynamic programming table (DP): We need to create a DP table that stores the beauty value for each possible subset of the array. The DP table will have the following dimensions: n x m, where n is the size of the array and m is the number of bad prime numbers.

Initialization: Initialize the DP table with -1, as we don't know the beauty values yet.

Transition function: For each element in the array, calculate the minimum prime divisor and check if it's a good or bad prime. If the minimum prime divisor has been seen before, look up its corresponding beauty value from the DP table. Otherwise, compute the beauty value for this new subset and store it in the DP table.

Base case: For an empty array, the beauty value is 0. For all elements in the array being bad primes, the beauty value is also 0.

Answer: The maximum beauty value stored in the DP table corresponds to the maximum beauty of the original array.
