===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the beauty value of a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime.
Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using previously computed values.
Consider two possibilities: either the last element in the subarray is a good prime or not.
For each pair of consecutive elements, consider whether the second one is a good or bad prime. If it's a good prime, add its minimum prime divisor to the current beauty value; if it's not, subtract its minimum prime divisor.
Update the 2D table with the maximum beauty values for subarrays ending at each index.
Fill a 1D array where each cell represents the maximum beauty of a subarray ending at that index, and then return the last element in the array as the final answer.
