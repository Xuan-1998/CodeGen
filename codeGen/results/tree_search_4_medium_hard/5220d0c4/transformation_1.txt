===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem. This approach uses memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The state expression could be defined as a tuple (i, j) representing the range [0, i] in the array and the set of bad prime numbers up to j.

The state is a pair (i, k) where i represents the index in the array and k is the maximum bad prime number considered so far. This allows us to use dynamic programming by storing the beauty values for previously computed subproblems in a dictionary dp.

To calculate the beauty value for each state, we iterate over all elements in the range [0, i] and for each element, check if it is a good or bad prime number based on whether its minimum prime divisor is less than or equal to k. If it's a good prime number, add 1 to the beauty value; if it's a bad prime number, subtract 1 from the beauty value.

Use a list comprehension to create a dictionary where each key is the state and each value is the minimum prime divisor for that state.

The function to calculate the minimum prime divisor could be written recursively or iteratively. For example, you can use a helper function to find the next prime number starting from a given number, and then iterate until it's less than the current number.
