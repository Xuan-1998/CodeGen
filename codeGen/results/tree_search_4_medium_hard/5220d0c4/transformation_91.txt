===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the beauty value of a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime.

Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using previously computed values.
Consider two possibilities: either the last element in the subarray is a good prime or not. The maximum beauty value seen so far.

Memoize the computation by storing previously computed values in a dictionary for O(1) lookups.
