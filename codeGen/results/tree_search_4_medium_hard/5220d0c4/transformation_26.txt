===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem. This approach uses memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.
A possible state expression could be the current element i and the maximum beauty achieved so far, considering all previous elements up to i-1.

To determine the maximum beauty achievable by combining each element with its previous minimum prime divisor and its next possible combination:
	* Initialize a dictionary memo with default value 0. This will store the maximum beauty values for previously computed subproblems.
	* Define a recursive function max_beauty(i, prev_min_prime) that returns the maximum beauty achieved considering all elements up to i (inclusive). prev_min_prime is the minimum prime divisor of the previous element.
	* Base case: if i is out of bounds or an element in bad primes, return 0.
	* If the current element's min_prime is the same as prev_min_prime, combine them and update memo with max(memo[i-1], prev_min_prime + 1).
	* Else, consider the maximum beauty achievable by combining each possible combination:
		+ If the current element is a bad prime, return 0.
		+ If min_prime of current element is different from prev_min_prime, combine them and update memo with max(memo[i-1], min_prime + 1).
	* Update the maximum beauty achieved so far by considering all elements up to i (inclusive).

Edge cases:
	* When i is out of bounds or an element in bad primes.
