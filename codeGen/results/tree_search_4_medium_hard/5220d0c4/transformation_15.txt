===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem. This approach uses memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The base case could be the beauty value for an empty array or when all elements in the array are bad primes. In this case, the beauty value would be the number of good primes in the array.

State: The beauty value of the whole array, and whether the last added element was a good prime or a bad prime. The next state is determined by comparing this beauty value with the maximum beauty value if the last added element is removed from the array.

Memoize the dynamic programming states, where each state is represented as a tuple of (array, good_primes_count) and compute the maximum beauty by iterating over all possible subarrays.

State transitions:
- If the last added element was a good prime, then add it to the current state.
- If the last added element was a bad prime, then remove it from the current state.
- If the array is empty or contains only bad primes, then start with an empty state.

Memoize the states and their corresponding beauty values. Compute the maximum beauty by iterating over all possible subarrays.
