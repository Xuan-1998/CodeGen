===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem. This approach uses memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

A possible state expression could be the current element i and the maximum beauty achieved so far, considering all previous elements up to i-1.
Consider two states: (i, m) representing the beauty value for elements from 0 to i and the maximum beauty achieved considering all previous elements up to i-1; and (j, k) for elements from j to i, where k is the minimum prime divisor of the elements in this range. Transition between these states occurs when the minimum prime divisor changes or if a bad prime number is encountered.

Use dynamic programming by creating a 2D table to store the beauty values for each subproblem, where the first dimension represents the current element i and the second dimension represents the minimum prime divisor of that element. This will allow you to easily compute the maximum beauty achieved considering all previous elements up to i-1, when the minimum prime divisor changes or a bad prime number is encountered.

To improve this plan, consider sorting the array by its elements and then iterating through the array. This way, you can group together elements with the same minimum prime divisor, reducing the time complexity of your algorithm.

The potential issue with this plan is that it may not be efficient if there are many unique minimum prime divisors in the array, as it would require a large 2D table to store all the beauty values. However, you can mitigate this by using a map to store the beauty values for each minimum prime divisor and then look up these values in constant time.

The plan includes edge cases such as handling the case where the input array is empty or has only one element.
