===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem. This approach uses memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The state expression could be defined as a tuple (i, j) representing the range [0, i] in the array and the set of bad prime numbers up to j.

The state is redefined as (i, j, k) where i represents the number of good primes seen so far, j is the total number of primes seen, and k is the maximum beauty value achieved so far. This allows for a more accurate calculation of the maximum beauty.

Use memoization to store the minimum prime divisor of each element and its corresponding beauty value as a dictionary or a list as (element, bad_prime) => beauty_value

The base case would be when i = 0, where the maximum beauty is 0. This is because there are no good primes seen so far.

The recursive case would be when i > 0, where the maximum beauty is calculated by considering two possibilities: 
- If the current element is a bad prime, then the maximum beauty is the minimum of the maximum beauty achieved without including this element and the maximum beauty achieved if this element is included.
- If the current element is a good prime, then the maximum beauty is the maximum of the maximum beauty achieved without including this element and the maximum beauty achieved if this element is included.

The updated plan includes edge cases by considering when i = 0. It also redefines the state to better capture the problem's constraints.
