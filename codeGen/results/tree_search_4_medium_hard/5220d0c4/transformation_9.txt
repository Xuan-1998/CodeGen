===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem.

State: The minimum prime divisor of each element in the subset, and whether it is a bad prime or not.
The base case could be the beauty value for an empty array or when all elements in the array are bad primes. In this case, the beauty value would be the number of good primes in the array.

To improve the plan, we can consider using a more efficient data structure to store the minimum prime divisors and whether they are bad primes. This could include creating a map where the keys are the minimum prime divisors and the values are lists or sets of elements that have those divisors and their corresponding good/bad prime status.

We should also ensure that our plan includes edge cases, such as when all elements in the array are bad primes, or when there is only one element in the array. In these cases, we would return a beauty value of 0 or the number of good primes in the array respectively.

To avoid potential issues with the plan, we should ensure that our dynamic programming approach avoids recomputing previously computed subproblems. This can be achieved by using memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.
