===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the beauty value of a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime.

Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using previously computed values.

Define the state expression as the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray, whether it's a good or bad prime number. The base case is the beauty value of an empty subarray, which is 0.

View the state as the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray, whether it's good or bad prime, and the maximum beauty obtained so far for subarrays with same minimum prime divisor.

Use a list of lists where each inner list represents the state for all elements up to the current index.

For each cell in the table, compute its value as the maximum of:
- The beauty value of the subarray ending at the previous index if the last element is not bad prime and the minimum prime divisor is the same.
- 0 (base case) if the subarray is empty.

To improve this plan, consider using memoization to store previously computed values. This can be done by maintaining a dictionary where the key is the state (minimum prime divisor, good/bad prime) and the value is the beauty value of that state.

The potential issues with this plan are:
- It does not handle edge cases such as an empty array.
- It assumes that all elements in the array are positive integers. If this is not the case, additional handling is needed.

Here's the updated version of the entire detailed plan:
