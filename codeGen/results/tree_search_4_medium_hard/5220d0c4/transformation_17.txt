===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem. This approach uses memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The base case could be the beauty value for an empty array or when all elements in the array are bad primes. In this case, the beauty value would be the number of good primes in the array.

State: The beauty value of the whole array, and whether the last added element was a good prime or a bad prime. The next state is determined by comparing this beauty value with the maximum beauty value if the last added element is removed from the array.

Implement a tabulation approach where you precompute and store all possible subarray beauties in a 2D table (dp) indexed by the array size and whether the last added element is good or bad. However, consider using a more efficient data structure such as a trie to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

For edge cases, make sure to handle the case where the input array is empty, and another case where the input array contains only one element (which would be either a good prime or a bad prime).
