===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the beauty value of a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime. Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using the previously computed values.

Consider two possibilities: either the last element in the subarray is a good prime or not.
For each pair of consecutive elements, consider whether the second one is a good or bad prime. If it's a good prime, add its minimum prime divisor to the current beauty value; if it's not, subtract its minimum prime divisor.

Maintain a priority queue to keep track of prime numbers and their corresponding minimum prime divisors. For each pair of consecutive elements:

* Calculate the new beauty value by considering whether they are good or bad primes.
* Update the maximum beauty accordingly.

Fill in edge cases:
- An empty array has a beauty value of 0.
- A single-element array with a non-good prime number has a beauty value of -1 (since there's no way to improve it).
