===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem. This approach uses memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.
A possible state expression could be the current element i and the maximum beauty achieved so far, considering all previous elements up to i-1.
View each element as having two possible states: either it's included in the combination with its previous minimum prime divisor or it's not. The transition relationships can be formulated based on whether the new element's minimum prime divisor is different from the current one, considering all previous elements up to i-1.
Design an iterative approach where each iteration represents a single element in the array; the state of the algorithm at each iteration would be the maximum beauty achieved with the elements processed so far, considering all previous elements up to i-1.
Identify edge cases: What if the first element is a bad prime number? Should it be treated separately or as part of the overall sequence?
Consider optimizing memoization by storing only the necessary information for each subproblem (e.g., minimum prime divisor and whether it's good or bad).
