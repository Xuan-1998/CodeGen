===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem. This approach uses memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

A possible state expression could be the current element i and the maximum beauty achieved so far, considering all previous elements up to i-1.
Determine the maximum beauty achievable by combining each element with its previous minimum prime divisor and its next possible combination. A transition occurs when an element has a different minimum prime divisor than its predecessor or if it's a bad prime number.

Use dynamic programming to create a 2D table where each cell [i, j] represents the maximum beauty achievable by combining elements up to i with their previous minimum prime divisors and bad prime numbers up to j.
The transition function would consider all possible combinations of the current element with its previous minimum prime divisor and bad prime numbers. This could be done by iterating over the previously computed cells in the table, finding the maximum beauty that can be achieved, and updating the cell accordingly.

To improve this plan, it might be beneficial to add a base case for the first element in the array, as there is no previous minimum prime divisor or bad prime number to consider. This would help in avoiding edge cases where the dynamic programming table is not initialized correctly.
