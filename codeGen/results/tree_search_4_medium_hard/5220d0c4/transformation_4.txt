===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem. This approach uses memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The state expression could be defined as a tuple (i, j) representing the range [0, i] in the array and the set of bad prime numbers up to j.

The state could be a 4-tuple (i, j, k, flag) where:
    - i is the index in the array
    - j is the current element being processed
    - k is the beauty value for the subproblem [0, i] with bad primes up to j
    - flag is an indicator for whether it's a good or bad prime

Use memoization with a dictionary where keys are tuples representing the state (i, j, flag) and values are the computed beauty values.

To improve the plan:
- Consider using a more efficient data structure like a Trie to store the bad primes
- Implement a function to efficiently calculate the minimum prime divisor of an integer

Potential issues with the plan:
- The plan might not handle edge cases properly (e.g., what if the array contains duplicates, or if there are no good primes?)
- The plan assumes that the beauty value can be calculated for each subproblem in constant time. This might not always be the case, and further optimization might be needed.
