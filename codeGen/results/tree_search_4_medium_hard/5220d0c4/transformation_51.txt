===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is defined by combining the beauty values of non-overlapping subarrays. Consider the maximum beauty value for all possible combinations of good and bad primes. Use memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The state expression is a tuple (k, v) where k is the index of the last considered element in the array, and v is its beauty value. The base case is when k = n-1.

state: (k, v) where k is the index of the last considered element in the array; v is its beauty value.
transition relation:
    if the current number is a good prime, update the state as (k+1, v + 1); 
    if it's a bad prime, update the state as min((k+1, n-1), k-1, v - 1)
Use dynamic programming with memoization by creating a 2D table where dp[i][j] represents the maximum beauty value for the subarray from index i to j.
