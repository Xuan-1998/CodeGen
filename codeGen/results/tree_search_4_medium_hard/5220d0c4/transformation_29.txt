This plan addresses potential issues by:

* Handling edge cases: The base case for the recursive function handles empty subarrays.
* Implementing memoization to avoid redundant computations.
* Iterating from the end of the array to fill up the memoization table efficiently.

The plan can be improved further by:

* Using a more efficient data structure instead of 2D arrays (e.g., arrays of pairs) for Memo.
* Optimizing the calculation of beauty values by combining similar terms or using mathematical properties of prime numbers.
