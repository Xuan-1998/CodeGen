===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the beauty value of a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime.
Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using previously computed values.

Consider two possibilities: either the last element in the subarray is a good prime or not.

Transition Relationship:
1. For each cell (i, j), if the last element in the subarray ending at index j is a good prime, then its beauty value is 1 + the maximum beauty of the subarray ending at index j-1.
2. Otherwise, its beauty value is the maximum beauty of the subarray ending at index j-1.

Initialize the first row of the table with 0's, since there are no elements to consider for the first subarray.
Fill the rest of the table using the transition relationship and previously computed values.

Return the last cell in the bottom-right corner as the maximum beauty value of the entire array.
