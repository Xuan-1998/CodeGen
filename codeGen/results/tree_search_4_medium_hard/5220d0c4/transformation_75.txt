===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the maximum beauty value that can be achieved for a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering two possibilities: either the last element in the subarray is a bad prime or not.

Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using previously computed values. For each element in the array:

* Consider whether it's a good prime or not.
* If it's a good prime, consider adding its minimum prime divisor to the current beauty value.
* If it's not, subtract its minimum prime divisor.
* Update the table with the maximum beauty value that can be achieved for the subarray ending at that index.

Fill the table of size n+1 x m where each cell represents the maximum beauty that can be achieved for a subarray ending at that index. Initialize all cells to 0, except for the last row which is initialized with the array elements.
