===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is defined by combining the beauty values of non-overlapping subarrays. Consider the maximum beauty value for all possible combinations of good and bad primes. Use memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The state expression is a tuple (i, j) representing the range [i, j] in the array, where i <= j and Beauty[i][j] represents the maximum beauty value for this range.

Transition: 
Beauty(i+1, j) = max(Beauty(i, j-1), Beauty(i-1, j)) + 
            (isGood(primeFactors[A[i]]) ? 1 : -1)

Utilize a 2D array (Beauty) to store the beauty values for all possible combinations of good and bad primes, where Beauty[i][j] represents the maximum beauty value for the range [i, j].

For every subarray, calculate its beauty by considering the minimum prime divisor and whether it is good or bad. This will help in determining which action to perform on a subset of the array.

To improve this plan, you can consider using a priority queue to keep track of all possible combinations of good and bad primes, sorting them based on their beauty values.

The potential issues with the plan are that it may not be efficient enough or it might not consider edge cases like when i is 0. To address these issues, you can add additional checks for edge cases in the code.

In terms of edge cases, this plan does account for arrays where i = 0 and j = n-1, as well as arrays with only one element.
