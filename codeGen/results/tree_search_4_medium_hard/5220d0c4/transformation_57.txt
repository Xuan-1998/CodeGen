===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is defined by combining the beauty values of non-overlapping subarrays. Consider the maximum beauty value for all possible combinations of good and bad primes. Use memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The state expression is a 4-tuple (i, j, f, g) representing the current window [i, j] with flags f indicating whether to consider bad primes or not, and g indicating whether the maximum beauty value includes good primes or not.

The maximum beauty value is the sum of the beauty values from overlapping subarrays, where each subarray's beauty value depends on its minimum prime divisor. Consider two cases: 1) when the current element is a good prime, and 2) when it's a bad prime. For both cases, update the DP table accordingly.

Use a 3D DP table to store and reuse previously computed beauty values for all possible combinations of good and bad primes.
