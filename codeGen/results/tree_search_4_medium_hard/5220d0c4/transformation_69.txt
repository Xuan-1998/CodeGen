===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the beauty value of a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime.

Define a dictionary, memo, to store the memoized values, mapping the state (minimum prime divisor and good/bad prime) to its corresponding beauty value.

Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using the previously computed values. The base case is the beauty value of an empty subarray, which is 0.

State expression: minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's good or bad prime number.

For each cell in the table:

1. Calculate the state for the current subarray.
2. Check if this state has been memoized before. If so, return its beauty value from the memo dictionary.
3. Otherwise, recursively calculate the maximum beauty of the subarray ending at the previous position and add the beauty value of the last element in the subarray to it.
