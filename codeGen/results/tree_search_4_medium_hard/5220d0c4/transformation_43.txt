===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is defined by combining the beauty values of non-overlapping subarrays. Consider the maximum beauty value for all possible combinations of good and bad primes. Use memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The state expression is a tuple (i, j) representing the range [i, j] in the array, where i <= j and Beauty[i][j] represents the maximum beauty value for this range.

Transition: maxBeauty[i+1][j] = max(maxBeauty[i][j-1], maxBeauty[i-1][j]) + (isGood(primeFactors[A[i]]) ? 1 : -1)

Use a list of lists to represent the dynamic programming table Beauty, where Beauty[i][j] represents the maximum beauty value for the range [i, j].

Initialization: For each row i in the table, set Beauty[i][0] = 0 (base case).

Base Case: The maximum beauty value for an empty array is 0.
