===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is defined by combining the beauty values of non-overlapping subarrays. Consider the maximum beauty value for all possible combinations of good and bad primes. Use memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The state expression is a tuple (k, v) where k is the index of the last considered element in the array, and v is its beauty value. The base case is when k = n-1, indicating that all elements have been processed.

state: k where k is the index of the last considered element in the array;
transition relation:
    - if the current number is a good prime, update the state as (k+1, v)
    - if it's a bad prime, update the state as min((k+1, v), (n-1, 0)) to ensure that beauty does not decrease
Memoization is applied to store the beauty values of previously computed subproblems using a dictionary or cache data structure.

state transition: 
    - for each number in the array:
        + if it's a good prime:
            ++ update state as (k+1, v)
        + if it's a bad prime:
            ++ update state as min((k+1, v), (n-1, 0))

Memoization cache: store the beauty values of previously computed subproblems

Return the maximum beauty value stored in the memoization cache when k = n-1
