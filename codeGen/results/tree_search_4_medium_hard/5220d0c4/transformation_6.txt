===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem. This approach uses memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The state expression could be defined as a tuple (i, j) representing the range [0, i] in the array and the set of bad prime numbers up to j.

State is correct: (i, j) where i represents the number of good primes seen so far and j is the total number of primes seen.

Memoize the beauty value for each subproblem by storing it in a dictionary or a list as (i, j) => beauty_value

To improve the plan:

* Define the base case: the maximum beauty when the range is [0, 0] and there are no bad prime numbers. This can be used to initialize the memoization.

Potential issues with the plan:
- The problem does not specify whether the array elements and the bad prime numbers are unique or not. If they are not unique, we need to consider duplicates in the subproblems.
- The plan does not account for edge cases like when there are no good primes or all prime numbers are bad.
