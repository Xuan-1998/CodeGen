===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is defined by combining the beauty values of non-overlapping subarrays. Consider the maximum beauty value for all possible combinations of good and bad primes. Use memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The state expression is a tuple (i, j) representing the range [i, j] in the array, where i <= j and Beauty[i][j] represents the maximum beauty value for this range.

Transition: Beauty(i+1, j) = max(Beauty(i, j-1), Beauty(i-1, j)) + (isGood(primeFactors[A[i]]) ? 1 : -1)

Use a dictionary to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems and update them based on the maximum beauty value of non-overlapping subarrays.

Transition: If A[i] is a bad prime, remove it from the range [i, j]. Otherwise, add its beauty value to the total. This step ensures that we always consider the optimal combination of good and bad primes.

Edge cases:

* Initialize Beauty[0][j] for all j in the range [0, n-1] with a default value (e.g., 0).
* Initialize Beauty[i][n-1] for all i in the range [0, n-1] with a default value (e.g., 0).
