===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the beauty value of a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime.
Consider two possibilities: either the last element in the subarray is a good prime or not.

For each element in the array, consider whether it is a good prime or not. If it's a good prime, add its minimum prime divisor to the current beauty value; if it's not, subtract its minimum prime divisor.

Use a 2D table with dimensions (n+1) x m, where n is the array size and m is the number of bad prime numbers. Initialize the first row to have values from 0 to n-1, representing the minimum prime divisors of the elements in the array.
Then, fill the rest of the table based on the state transition relationship defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime.

Fill the first row with values from 0 to n-1, representing the minimum prime divisors of the elements in the array.
For each subsequent row (starting from the second), for each cell in that row:
    If the current element is a good prime:
        Add its minimum prime divisor to the current beauty value
    Else if the current element is not a good prime and not one of the bad primes:
        Subtract its minimum prime divisor from the current beauty value

The maximum beauty value will be the last cell in the table (bottom right).
