===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the beauty value of a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime.

Consider two possibilities: either the last element in the subarray is a good prime or not.

Transition Relationship:
 1. If the last element is a good prime, consider the beauty value of the subarray without this element.
2. If the last element is a bad prime, subtract the minimum prime divisor from the beauty value of the subarray without this element.

Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using the previously computed values.
