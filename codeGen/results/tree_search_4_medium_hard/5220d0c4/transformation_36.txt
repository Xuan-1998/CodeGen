===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is defined by combining the beauty values of non-overlapping subarrays. Consider the maximum beauty value for all possible combinations of good and bad primes. Use memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The state expression is a tuple (i, j) representing the range [i, j] in the array, where i <= j and Beauty[i][j] represents the maximum beauty value for this range.

Transition: 
- Initialize dp table with base case value (0 or 1)
- For each element A[i], find its minimum prime divisor using Sieve of Eratosthenes
- If the prime is good, set dp[i+1][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], Beauty[i][j])
- Else, set dp[i+1][j] = 0 for i <= j
Use a 2D dynamic programming table where Beauty[i][j] is the maximum beauty value for the range [i, j], with initialization of Beauty[0][n-1] to some base case value.
