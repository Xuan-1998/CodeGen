===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is defined by combining the beauty values of non-overlapping subarrays. To solve this problem efficiently, we can use dynamic programming with memoization.

The state expression is a tuple (i, j) representing the range [i, j] in the array, where i <= j and Beauty[i][j] represents the maximum beauty value for this range. We will maintain a 2D array maxBeauty to store the maximum beauty values for all subarrays.

State: maxBeauty[i][j] representing the maximum beauty value for the subarray from index i to j.

We can define the following base cases:
- For an empty subarray (i.e., i > j), the maximum beauty is 0.
- For a single-element subarray, the maximum beauty is either 1 if the element is a good prime or 0 if it's a bad prime.

To fill in the maxBeauty array, we iterate over all possible subarrays and update their maximum beauty values based on the following recurrence relation:
- If the current element is a good prime, consider including it in the subarray. The maximum beauty value for this subarray is the maximum of the beauty values for the subarrays ending at the previous elements.
- If the current element is a bad prime, consider excluding it from the subarray. The maximum beauty value for this subarray is the maximum of the beauty values for the subarrays ending at the previous elements.

Finally, we return maxBeauty[0][n-1] as the maximum beauty value for the entire array.

This plan should correctly solve the problem and handle edge cases.
