===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is defined by combining the beauty values of non-overlapping subarrays. Consider the maximum beauty value for all possible combinations of good and bad primes. Use memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The state expression is a tuple (k, v) where k is the index of the last considered element in the array, and v is its beauty value. The base case is when k = n-1.

state: (k, v) where k is the index of the last considered element in the array, and v is its beauty value;
transition relation:
    if the current number is a good prime, update the state as (k+1, v + min_prime);
    if it's a bad prime, update the state as (k+1, max(0, v - 1));

Memoize the function to store previously computed beauty values.

For each prefix of the array, consider all possible combinations of good and bad primes. The maximum beauty value is the maximum beauty value obtained from all these combinations.

The time complexity is O(n*m) where n is the size of the array and m is the number of bad prime numbers. The space complexity is O(n*m) for storing memoized values.

This plan does not consider edge cases but it's a good starting point.
