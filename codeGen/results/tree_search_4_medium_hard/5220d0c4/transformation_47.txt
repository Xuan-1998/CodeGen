===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is defined by combining the beauty values of non-overlapping subarrays. Consider the maximum beauty value for all possible combinations of good and bad primes. 

state: (k, v) where k is the index of the last considered element in the array, and v is its beauty value; 
transition relation: 
  - if the current number is a good prime, update the state as (k+1, v + min_prime); 
  - if it's a bad prime, update the state as (k+1, max(0, v - 1)); 

Create a dp table where dp[i] represents the maximum beauty value ending at index i. Initialize dp[n-1] to be the beauty of the last element.
Iterate backwards from n-2 to 0. For each index i:
  - Calculate min_prime as the minimum prime divisor of the number at index i;
  - If the current number is a good prime, update dp[i] as max(dp[i+1], v + min_prime);
  - If it's a bad prime, update dp[i] as max(dp[i+1], max(0, v - 1));
Return dp[0].
