===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem. This approach uses memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The state expression could be defined as a tuple (i, j) representing the range [0, i] in the array and the set of bad prime numbers up to j.

The state could be a 3-tuple (i, j, flag) where i is the index in the array, j is the current element being processed, and flag is an indicator for whether it's a good or bad prime.

Implement tabulation using a 2D DP table to store beauty values based on the range [0, i] in the array and the set of bad prime numbers up to j. Initialize the DP table with values from the initial state (0, 0) and iterate through the array while updating the DP table values.

Update flag for each element as good or bad prime based on whether it's included in the set of bad primes or not. Update the beauty value accordingly.

At the end of the iteration, return the maximum beauty value stored in the DP table.
