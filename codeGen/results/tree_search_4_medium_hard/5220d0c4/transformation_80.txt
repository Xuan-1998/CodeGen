===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the beauty value of a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime.

Consider two possibilities: either the last element in the subarray is a good prime or not.
  - If the last element is a good prime, then for each previous element, consider its minimum prime divisor. If this prime number is also a good prime, increment the beauty value by 1. Otherwise, decrement it by 1.
  - If the last element is not a good prime, consider only the minimum prime divisor of the last element. Increment or decrement the beauty value based on whether this prime number is a good or bad prime.

Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using the previously computed values.

The base case for the beauty value of an empty subarray should be 0.
The final answer would be the maximum beauty value in any row (or column) at the bottom-right corner.
