===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the beauty value of a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime. Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using the previously computed values.

Consider two possibilities: either the last element in the subarray is a good prime or not.
For each pair of consecutive elements, consider whether the second one is a good or bad prime. If it's a good prime, add its minimum prime divisor to the current beauty value; if it's not, subtract its minimum prime divisor.

Consider implementing memoization to store previously computed values and avoid redundant calculations.

Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.

Implement a function that calculates the beauty value of a subarray given its prefix and suffix. Use dynamic programming to fill the table and avoid redundant calculations.

Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using the previously computed values.
