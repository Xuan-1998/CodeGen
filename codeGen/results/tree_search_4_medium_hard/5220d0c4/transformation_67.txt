===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the beauty value of a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime.

Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using the previously computed values. Define the state expression as the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray, whether it's good or bad prime number. The base case is the beauty value of an empty subarray, which is 0.

View the state as the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray, whether it's good or bad prime, and the maximum beauty obtained so far for subarrays with same minimum prime divisor. You can store the state in a dictionary where the key is the minimum prime divisor and whether it's good or bad, and the value is the beauty of that subarray ending at that index.

To fill the table, iterate over each element in the array, and for each element, calculate the beauty value based on its minimum prime divisor and whether it's a good or bad prime. If the minimum prime divisor has been seen before, use the previously computed beauty value for that state.
