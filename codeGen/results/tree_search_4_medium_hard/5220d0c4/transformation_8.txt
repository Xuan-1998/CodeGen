===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem. This approach uses memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.
The state expression could be defined as a tuple (i, j) representing the range [0, i] in the array and the set of bad prime numbers up to j.

State: (i, j) where i represents the number of good primes seen so far and j is the total number of primes seen.
Implement a dynamic programming table where each cell represents the beauty value for the range [0, i] in the array and the set of bad prime numbers up to j

Updated state expression: (i, j) -> (num_good_primes, num_total_primes)
The plan is correct, but it can be improved by adding edge cases. For example, handle the case where i or j is 0.
