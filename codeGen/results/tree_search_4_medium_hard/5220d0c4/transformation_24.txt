===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem. This approach uses memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

A possible state expression could be the current element i and the maximum beauty achieved so far, considering all previous elements up to i-1.

Determine the maximum beauty achievable by combining each element with its previous minimum prime divisor and its next possible combination. A transition occurs when an element has a different minimum prime divisor than its predecessor or if it's a bad prime number.

Memoize the state expression using a dictionary where the key is the current element i and the value is the maximum beauty achieved so far.

Determine the initial state by considering the first element of the array. The initial state can be represented as (0, 0), indicating that no elements have been processed yet.

Iterate through the array from left to right. For each element i:

* If it's a bad prime number, update the maximum beauty achieved so far using the previous maximum beauty and the minimum prime divisor of the current element.
* If it has the same minimum prime divisor as its predecessor, combine them into a single subproblem and update the maximum beauty achieved so far accordingly.
* Otherwise, calculate the new maximum beauty considering all possible combinations and update the dictionary with the new state.

Return the maximum beauty achieved at the end of the array. This value represents the maximum beauty achievable by combining each element with its previous minimum prime divisor and its next possible combination.
