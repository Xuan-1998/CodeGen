===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: For each element in the array, consider the minimum prime divisor of that element. If two elements have the same minimum prime divisor, they can be combined into a single subproblem.

The base case could be the beauty value for an empty array or when all elements in the array are bad primes. In this case, the beauty value would be the number of good primes in the array.

State: The beauty value of the whole array, and whether the last added element was a good prime or a bad prime. The next state is determined by comparing this beauty value with the maximum beauty value if the last added element is removed from the array.

Use memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed states, and update the maximum beauty value recursively based on the goodness or badness of the last added element.

State transitions:

* If the last added element was a good prime, consider adding it to the current state. Calculate the new beauty value by adding the minimum prime divisor of this element.
* If the last added element was a bad prime, remove it from the current state. The new beauty value is the maximum beauty value without considering this element.

Memoization:

* Store the beauty values for each subproblem in a dictionary or hash table.
* When calculating the beauty value for a given state, check if the result is already stored in the memo. If so, use the cached result instead of recalculating it.
