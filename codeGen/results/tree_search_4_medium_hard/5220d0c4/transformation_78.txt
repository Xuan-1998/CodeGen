===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the beauty value of a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime.

Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using previously computed values. Consider two possibilities: either the last element in the subarray is a good prime or not.

Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum beauty value of the subarray ending at index i and having j elements.

For each cell, consider two cases:
- The last element is a good prime: Add its minimum prime divisor to the beauty value of the subarray without it.
- The last element is not a good prime (i.e., it's bad): Subtract the minimum prime divisor from the beauty value of the subarray without it.

Fill the table row by row, starting from the first row. For each cell in the current row, calculate its value using the previously computed values and update the maximum beauty value for the given number of elements.
