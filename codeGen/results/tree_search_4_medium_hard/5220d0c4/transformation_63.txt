===BEGIN PLAN===
Use tabulation to fill a 2D table where each cell represents the beauty value of a subarray ending at that index. The state transition relationship is defined by considering the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray and whether it's a good or bad prime.

Define the state expression as the minimum prime divisor of the last element in the subarray, whether it's a good or bad prime number, and the maximum beauty obtained so far for subarrays ending at previous elements. The base case is the beauty value of an empty subarray, which is 0.

Consider a state as the last element in the subarray, whether it's good or bad prime, and the maximum beauty obtained so far for subarrays ending at previous elements.

Use a dictionary to store previously computed values and look up the value of interest in constant time. Update the state expression based on whether the minimum prime divisor is a good or bad prime number. 

Store all previously computed values in the dictionary to avoid redundant computation.

Fill the table from left to right, top to bottom, using the previously computed values.

Return the maximum beauty value stored in the last cell of the table as the final answer.
