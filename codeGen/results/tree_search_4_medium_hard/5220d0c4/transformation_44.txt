===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is defined by combining the beauty values of non-overlapping subarrays. Consider the maximum beauty value for all possible combinations of good and bad primes. Use memoization to store the beauty values for previously computed subproblems.

The state expression is a tuple (i, j) representing the range [i, j] in the array, where i <= j and Beauty[i][j] represents the maximum beauty value for this range.

Transition: maxBeauty[i+1][j] = max(maxBeauty[i][j-1], maxBeauty[i-1][j]) + (isGood(primeFactors[A[i]]) ? 1 : -1)

Use a recursive function with memoization by storing the beauty values in a dictionary, where the key is the tuple (i, j) and the value is the maximum beauty value for this range.

However, there's a missing detail about how to calculate prime factors of each number. Also, it's not clear how to handle the cases when i=0 or j=n-1. To fix these issues:

1. Define a function to calculate the prime factors of a given number.
2. Modify the transition rule to handle edge cases for i=0 and j=n-1.

The plan can be improved by considering the time complexity of the recursive function. Instead of calculating prime factors for each number, it would be more efficient to precompute all prime numbers up to the maximum value in the array, then use this information to speed up the beauty calculation.

The potential issues with the plan are:

* It might not handle edge cases correctly.
* The transition rule is complex and may lead to incorrect results if not implemented correctly.

To include edge cases, the plan should be modified to handle the cases when i=0 or j=n-1. This can be done by adding a base case for these edge cases in the recursive function.

Here's an updated version of the detailed plan:
