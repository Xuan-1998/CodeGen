===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization for top-down approach: Implement a dictionary or cache to store and reuse previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems.

State could be (i, reachable), where i is the current index and reachable is a boolean indicating whether it's possible to reach i.

Transition relationship defined as:
- If i == len(arr) - 1, then reachable = True
- Else, reachable = arr[i] >= 1

Consider implementing a dynamic programming table where each cell represents the maximum jump length at that position.
The transition relationship could be:
- dp[i] = True if dp[i-1] and arr[i-1] >= i (i.e., it's possible to reach i)
- Else, dp[i] = False

Consider maintaining an additional array to track whether each cell is fully computed or not, so that we only re-compute when necessary.
