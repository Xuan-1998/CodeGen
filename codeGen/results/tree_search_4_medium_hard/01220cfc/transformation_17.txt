===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify potential subproblems: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.

Define dp[i] as True if for some j in [0, i-1], dp[j] is True and jumps[i-1] >= i - j. This means that there's a way to reach index i by jumping from some earlier position.

dp[i] = any j in range(i) where dp[j] is True and (j + jumps[j]) >= i

Use dictionary-based memoization to store the results of subproblems and look up their solutions when needed.

For each index i, we need to consider all previous indices j where it's possible to reach i from j. The condition for this is j + jumps[j] >= i.

dp[i] = any j in range(i) where dp[j] is True and (j + jumps[j]) >= i

If there exists such a j, then we can reach index i, so set dp[i] = True. Otherwise, set it to False.
