===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization for top-down approach: Implement a dictionary or cache to store and reuse previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems.

The state could be the current index, and the value at that index represents whether it's possible to reach from there. This can be represented as a boolean value (True/False).

Think of each element in the array as a 'visibility' - whether it's possible to reach from that point. The state could also represent the maximum reachable index from that point.

Use dynamic programming to fill up a table where each cell represents the state at that index. For each cell, calculate the value based on the values at previous cells and update the visibility accordingly.

To calculate the value for a cell, iterate through all previous cells within the jump length specified by the current cell's value. If any of these previous cells are visible (i.e., their corresponding cell in the table is True), then the current cell should also be marked as visible.

Finally, check if the last index of the array is marked as visible in the table to determine if it's possible to reach. If it's visible, return True; otherwise, return False.
