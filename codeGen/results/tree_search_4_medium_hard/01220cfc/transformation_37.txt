===BEGIN PLAN===
Incorporate optimal substructure: Create an array dp where dp[i] is True if and only if it's possible to reach the i-th index.

dp[i] depends on the maximum reachable index from previous position, where it's possible to reach dp[i] if there are elements that can be reached. If there are no elements that can be reached, then dp[i] = False;

For each element in the array, check if the jump length is greater than or equal to i - previous_index. If true, update previous_index and continue this process until reaching the last index.

Return dp[length - 1], which represents whether it's possible to reach the last index.
