===BEGIN PLAN===
Incorporate optimal substructure: Think about how the solution to one subproblem can be used to solve another related subproblem.

The state is dp[i], which represents whether it's possible to reach the i-th index. The base case is dp[0] = True, since we can always start at the beginning.
dp[i] represents whether it's possible to reach the i-th index from the 0th index, so dp[i] = (any j <= i-1 and arr[j] + 1 >= i) or any k < i and dp[k].

The issue with this plan is that it doesn't consider the constraint that each element in the array represents the maximum jump length at that position. This means we can only jump to an index if the value at that index is greater than or equal to the current index.

To improve this plan, we need to incorporate this constraint into our dynamic programming approach. We can do this by iterating through the array and updating dp[i] based on whether it's possible to reach i from any j < i with a jump of arr[j].
