===BEGIN PLAN===
Incorporate optimal substructure: Think about how the solution to one subproblem can be used to solve another related subproblem.
The state is dp[i], which represents whether the i-th element can be reached. The base case is dp[0] = True, since we start at the beginning and the maximum reachable index from there is always 0.

dp[i] = or for j in range(0, i): dp[j] if j + 1 <= i and j <= min(i, j + arr[j])

Create a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing an array of boolean values representing the reachable status at each index. Initialize dp[0] to True since we can always reach the start.

for i in range(1, n):
    dp[i] = False
    for j in range(0, i):
        if arr[j] >= i - j and (j + 1 <= i or dp[j]):
            dp[i] = True

Return dp[n-1]
