===BEGIN PLAN===
Incorporate optimal substructure: Think about how the solution to one subproblem can be used to solve another related subproblem.

The state is dp[i], which represents whether it's possible to reach the i-th index. The base case is dp[0] = True, since we can always start at the beginning.

dp[i] is the maximum jump length at index i minus one, considering only the indices reachable from the previous steps.

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with a 1D array to store the intermediate results.

For each index i, calculate dp[i] as the maximum of:

- True, if it's possible to reach index i - 1 and the jump length at i - 1 is greater than or equal to the distance from i - 1 to i
- False, otherwise

This ensures that we consider all reachable indices when calculating dp[i]

The final answer is dp[n - 1], where n is the size of the array.
