===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization for top-down approach: Implement a dictionary or cache to store and reuse previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems.

The state could be the current index, and the value at that index represents whether it's possible to reach the last index from there. This is because each element in the array represents the maximum jump length at that position. 

Store the result of the problem at a given index in the cache. Then, when calculating the result for an index that has been visited before, retrieve the result from the cache instead of recalculating it.

The transition relationship would involve updating the reachable index based on the maximum jump length at the current position. If the maximum jump length is greater than or equal to the difference between the current index and the last index, then the current index can be reached from the last index.

Store previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems in a dictionary as a cache and reuse them when needed.

If the last index of the array can be reached from itself (i.e., the maximum jump length at that position is greater than or equal to 0), then it's possible to reach the last index. Otherwise, it's not possible to reach the last index.
