===BEGIN PLAN===
Incorporate optimal substructure: Think about how the solution to one subproblem can be used to solve another related subproblem.

dp[i] depends on the maximum reachable index from the previous position. If there are no elements that can be reached, then dp[i] = False; otherwise, it's possible to reach dp[i].

dp[i] is True if i+1 <= len(arr) and arr[i] >= 1, else False.

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a table with all False values and then iteratively update the table based on the maximum reachable index from the previous position.

For each index i:
    Initialize dp[i] = False
    For each j in range(i-arr[i], i+1):
        If arr[j] >= 1 and dp[j]:
            dp[i] = True
            Break

Return dp[-1]
