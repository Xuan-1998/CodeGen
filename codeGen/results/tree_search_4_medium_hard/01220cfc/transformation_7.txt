===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify potential subproblems: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.

DP states: For each position i, define dp[i] as True if it's possible to reach index i from the start, and False otherwise.
dp[i] is True if and only if it's possible to reach i-1 from the start, and i-1 + arr[i-1] >= i.
Use the original array as the DP states, reusing existing values when possible.

To avoid unnecessary computations, consider initializing dp[0] = True (since we can always reach the first index).

Edge cases: Consider handling the case where arr is empty or contains only one element. In this case, it's not possible to reach any other indices besides the start.
