===BEGIN PLAN===
Incorporate optimal substructure: Think about how the solution to one subproblem can be used to solve another related subproblem.
The state is dp[i], which represents whether the i-th element can be reached. The base case is dp[0] = True, since we start at the beginning and the maximum reachable index from there is always 0.

dp[i] = any dp[j] where j + arr[j] >= i

Memoize the recursive function by storing its results in a dictionary and checking for existing solutions before re-computing them.
This plan takes into account that each element in the array represents the maximum jump length at that position. It also handles edge cases correctly, such as when it's possible to reach the last index.
