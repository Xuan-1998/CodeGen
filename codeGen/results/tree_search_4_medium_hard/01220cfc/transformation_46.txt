===BEGIN PLAN===
Incorporate optimal substructure: Think about how the solution to one subproblem can be used to solve another related subproblem.

The state is dp[i], which represents whether the i-th element can be reached. The base case is dp[0] = True, since we start at the beginning and the maximum reachable index from there is always 0.

dp[i] = any dp[j] where j + 1 <= i and j <= min(i, arr[j])

Implement tabulation using a bottom-up approach, starting from the base case (dp[0] = True) and iteratively building up the solution. We start by initializing dp as an array of all False values.

for i in range(1, len(arr)):
    for j in range(min(i, arr[i-1]), 0, -1):
        if dp[j]:
            dp[i] = True
            break

Return dp[-1], which represents whether the last element can be reached.
