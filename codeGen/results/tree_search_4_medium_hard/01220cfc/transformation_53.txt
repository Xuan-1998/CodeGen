===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization for top-down approach: Implement a dictionary or cache to store and reuse previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems.

The state could be a tuple containing the current index and whether it's possible to reach that index, with the initial value set to False. The transition relationship would involve checking if the maximum jump length at the current position is greater than the last reachable index, and if so, updating the last reachable index.

Initialize the dynamic programming table with all values initially set to False, representing that no index can be reached.

Iterate through each index in the array, and for each index:

    Check if the maximum jump length at this index is greater than the current last reachable index. If so, update the last reachable index.
    Check if it's possible to reach this index (i.e., the last reachable index is equal to or greater than the current index). If so, set the value in the dynamic programming table for this index to True.

Return the value at the last index of the array. If it's True, then it's possible to reach the last index; otherwise, it's not possible.
