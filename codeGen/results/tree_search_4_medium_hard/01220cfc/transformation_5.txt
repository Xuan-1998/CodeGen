===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify potential subproblems: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.

DP states: For each position i, define dp[i] as True if it's possible to reach index i from the start, and False otherwise.
dp[i] is True if it's possible to reach i-1 from the start, and i-1 + arr[i-1] >= i.
Use a separate array for DP states with dp[0] = True

Iterate through the array: For each position i, update dp[i] based on dp[i-1] and arr[i-1].

Return dp[n-1], where n is the length of the array.
