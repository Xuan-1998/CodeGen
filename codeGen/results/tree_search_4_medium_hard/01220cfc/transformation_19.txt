===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify potential subproblems: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.

Define dp[i] as True if for some j in [0, i-1], dp[j] is True and jumps[i-1] >= i - j. This means that there's a way to reach index i by jumping from some earlier position.

dp[i] = any dp[j] where j < i and j + jumps[j] >= i

Create a dynamic programming table with size equal to the length of the input array, where each cell dp[i] represents whether it's possible to reach index i.

Initialize all cells in the dp table as False.

Iterate through the array from right to left (from end to start). For each element at index i:

    If jumps[i-1] >= i: Set dp[i] = True
    Else:
        Iterate from j = 0 to i - 1. For each j:
            If dp[j] is True and jumps[j] >= i - j: Set dp[i] = True; break the loop

Return dp[length-1]
