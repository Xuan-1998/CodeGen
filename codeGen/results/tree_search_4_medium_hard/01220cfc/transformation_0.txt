===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify potential subproblems: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.

DP states: For each position i, define dp[i] as True if it's possible to reach index i from the start, and False otherwise.
dp[i] is True if and only if for some 0 <= j < i, we have dp[j] and arr[j] >= i - j.

Create a bottom-up dynamic programming table by initializing dp with a length of n+1 elements, where each element represents the maximum jump length at that position.

Iterate over the array from left to right. For each index i:
    If it's possible to reach this point (dp[i-1] is True), then update dp[i] as follows: dp[i] = any j < i such that arr[j] >= i - j.
    If it's not possible to reach this point, set dp[i] to False.

Finally, return the value of dp[n], which represents whether or not it's possible to reach the last index.
