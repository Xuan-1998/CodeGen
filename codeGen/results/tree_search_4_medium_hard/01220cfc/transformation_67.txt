===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization for top-down approach: Implement a dictionary or cache to store and reuse previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems.
The state could be the current index and whether it's possible to reach it.

Define the base case as the initial state (index 0). If it's not possible to reach the initial state, then return False.
For each subsequent index, check if it's within the jump range of the previous maximum reachable index. If yes, and the previous index can be reached, then mark this index as reachable.

Use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming by defining a table to store the results for each subproblem and fill it up in a bottom-up manner.
The state is the current index and whether it's possible to reach that index. The transition relationship could be based on whether the current index is within the jump range of the previous maximum reachable index.

Fill the table starting from the initial state (index 0). For each cell, check if the current index can be reached.
If yes, mark this index as reachable; otherwise, it's not possible to reach this index.
Finally, return whether the last index is reachable or not.
