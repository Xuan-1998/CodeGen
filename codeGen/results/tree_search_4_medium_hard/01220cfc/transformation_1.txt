===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify potential subproblems: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.

DP states: For each position i, define dp[i] as True if it's possible to reach index i from the start, and False otherwise.
dp[i] is True if and only if for some 0 <= j < i, we have dp[j] and arr[j] >= i - j.

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by defining an array dp where dp[i] represents whether it's possible to reach index i from the start. Initialize dp[0] to True since it's always possible to reach the start.
For each position i, calculate dp[i] based on dp[j] and arr[j] for 0 <= j < i. If there exists a j such that dp[j] is True and arr[j] >= i - j, then set dp[i] to True; otherwise, set it to False.

Use the final value of dp[dp.length-1] as the output, which indicates whether or not it's possible to reach the last index.
