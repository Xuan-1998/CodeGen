===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization for top-down approach: Implement a dictionary or cache to store and reuse previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems.

1. Define the state:
    - The state could be a tuple containing the current index and the last reachable index, and the value at that position represents the maximum reachable index from there.
2. Define the transition relationship:
    - For each step, update the last reachable index based on the maximum jump length at the current position.

3. Initialize the cache (dictionary) to store the maximum reachable index for each position in the array.

4. Traverse the array top-down:
    - Start from the first element and recursively explore each subproblem.
    - For each position, compute the maximum reachable index based on the transition relationship.
    - Store the result in the cache for future reference.

5. The final answer is whether the last reachable index reaches the end of the array or not.
