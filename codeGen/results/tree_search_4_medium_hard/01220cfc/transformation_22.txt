===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify potential subproblems: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.

Define dp[i] as True if for some j in [0, i-1], dp[j] is True and jumps[i-1] >= i - j. This means that there's a way to reach index i by jumping from some earlier position.
dp[i] = or [dp[j] and j + jumps[j] >= i for j in range(i-1)]

Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and filling up the dp table
dp[0] = True, since we can always reach the first index

Iterate from left to right:
for i in range(1, len(jumps)):
    if jumps[i-1] >= i: # if we can jump to this position
        dp[i] = or [dp[j] and j + jumps[j] >= i for j in range(i-1)] 
    else:
        dp[i] = False

Return dp[-1] as the result, which represents whether it's possible to reach the last index.
