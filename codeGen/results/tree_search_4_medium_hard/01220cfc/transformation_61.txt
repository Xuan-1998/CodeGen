===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization for top-down approach: Implement a dictionary or cache to store and reuse previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems.

The state could be a tuple of (current_index, max_reachable_index) to keep track of both indices. This will help in efficiently checking if a jump from the current position is possible.

Use a queue-based approach to simulate jumps from the start of the array to the end, keeping track of visited indices and the maximum reachable index at each step. This will help in efficiently exploring all possible jumps.

Combine the memoization and queue-based approaches by using memoization to store previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems and the queue-based approach to explore all possible jumps. This will help in avoiding redundant computations and ensure that we reach the correct answer.
