===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify potential subproblems: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.

DP states: For each position i, define dp[i] as True if it's possible to reach index i from the start, and False otherwise.
dp[i] is True if there's an index k such that k <= i and arr[k] >= i - k, and also dp[k] is True.

Define a 1D table dp with length n+1, where n is the length of the array. For each position i, dp[i] represents whether it's possible to reach index i from the start.

The base case is dp[0] = True, as we can always reach the start.

For each i from 1 to n:
    If arr[i-1] >= i - 1 and dp[i-1], then dp[i] = True.
    Otherwise, dp[i] = False.

Finally, return dp[n].
