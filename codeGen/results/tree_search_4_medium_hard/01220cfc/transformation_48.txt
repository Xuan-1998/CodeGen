===BEGIN PLAN===
Incorporate optimal substructure: Think about how the solution to one subproblem can be used to solve another related subproblem.
The state is dp[i], which represents whether the i-th element can be reached. The base case is dp[0] = True, since we start at the beginning and the maximum reachable index from there is always 0.

dp[i] = or for j in range(0, i): dp[j] if j + 1 <= i and arr[j] >= i - j
Use memoization with recursion to store the intermediate results in a dictionary and avoid repeated computations.
The function will take two parameters: the current index i and the jump array arr. It returns True if we can reach the last element, False otherwise.

For the base case, return True for the first element since it's always possible to reach it (i.e., dp[0] = True).
If i is the last element, return True as well because we've already reached the end.
For all other cases, iterate through the array from 0 to i-1 and check if we can jump from each position j to i. If we can, recursively call the function with the new index i-j and arr[j] (since that's the maximum jump length from j). Add these results together using logical OR.
Return False only when we've checked all positions in the array and still haven't reached the last element.
