===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify potential subproblems: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.
Define dp[i] as True if for some j in [0, i-1], dp[j] is True and jumps[i-1] >= i - j. This means that there's a way to reach index i by jumping from some earlier position.

dp[i] = (any j in range(i) such that dp[j] and jumps[j] >= i-j)

Implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach:
    1. Initialize dp[0] as True.
    2. For each index i, iterate through all previous indices j where j < i.
    3. If dp[j] is True and the jump from j to i is valid (i.e., jumps[j] >= i-j), then set dp[i] as True.
    4. Finally, return dp[-1], which represents whether it's possible to reach the last index.
