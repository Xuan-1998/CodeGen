===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization for top-down approach: Implement a dictionary or cache to store and reuse previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems.

The state could be a tuple of (current_index, max_reachable_index) to keep track of both indices.
    Initialize the memoization table with default values (False).

Implement a queue-based approach to simulate jumps from the start of the array to the end:
    Use a queue to store tuples of (current_index, max_reachable_index).
    Start at index 0 and update max_reachable_index as you iterate through the input array.
    For each element in the array, add its maximum reachable index to the queue if it's not visited yet.

Use a tabulation approach by initializing an array with zeros:
    Initialize an array of size n (where n is the length of the input array) filled with zeros.

Employ top-down memoization and update the table as you iterate through the input array:
    For each element, update max_reachable_index based on its value.
    If a previously computed solution is found in the memoization table for an overlapping subproblem, return False if it's not reachable or True if it is.
