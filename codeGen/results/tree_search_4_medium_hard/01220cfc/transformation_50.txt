===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization for top-down approach: Implement a dictionary or cache to store and reuse previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems.

The state could be the current index, i, and the value at that index represents the maximum reachable index from there, j. The goal is to reach the last element of the array, which can be represented as a special case where the state is the last index, len(arr) - 1, and the value at that index represents whether it's possible to reach from there.

The transition relationship could be whether the maximum reachable index from the previous position, j - arr[j], is greater than or equal to the current position i. This means if the maximum jump length from the current position is not enough to reach the next position, then we cannot reach that position.

Use a dynamic programming table to store and fill up the solution bottom-up, by iterating over the array and updating the last index that can be reached from each position. The base case should be when i = 0, where we start from the beginning of the array, so we always can reach it.

Fill up the table until we reach the last element, and check if the last index is reachable. If it's reachable, return True; otherwise, return False.
