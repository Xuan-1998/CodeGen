===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify potential subproblems:
Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.

DP states:
For each position i, define dp[i] as True if it's possible to reach index i from the start, and False otherwise.
dp[i] is True if and only if for some 0 <= j < i, we have dp[j] and arr[j] >= i - j.

Implement memoization using a dictionary where the keys are the indices and the values are booleans indicating whether or not it is possible to reach each index.

Optimize the plan:
To avoid redundant calculations, sort the array in descending order of its elements. This ensures that when checking if dp[i] is True for some i, we always consider the maximum jump length first, which can reduce the number of subproblems to be solved.

Edge cases:
Consider handling edge cases such as an empty array or a single-element array separately. The plan can be easily modified to handle these cases without affecting the overall logic.
