===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify potential subproblems: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.
The base case is dp[0] = True because we can always reach the first element (it has no previous elements to jump from).
State: dp[i] represents whether it's possible to reach index i without going back in time.
Transition relationship: dp[i] = (i > 0) || any j in range(0, min(i+1, arr.length)) such that the jump from j can reach i and we haven't gone back in time (i.e., dp[j-arr[j]] == True).
Dynamically construct the table by iterating through the array and using nested if-else statements to update the table based on the transition relationship.
