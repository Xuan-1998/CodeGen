===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization for top-down approach: Implement a dictionary or cache to store and reused previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems.

The state could be the current index and whether it's possible to reach it. This is correct, as we need to keep track of which indices are reachable from previous ones.

Third choice: Consider the current index i and its remaining length (i.e., arr[i]) as the state. The transition relationship could be defined as 'it is possible to reach the next index if the remaining length at the current index is greater than or equal to 1'.

Design a top-down memoization approach by defining a recursive function that takes the current index and returns True if it's possible to reach that index, False otherwise.

To improve the plan:

* The base case should be when the current index is the last index in the array. In this case, return True if it's possible to reach the last index.
* Define a helper function to check if it's possible to reach an index from the given state. This function will recursively call itself for each reachable index and update the memoization dictionary accordingly.

To avoid potential issues:

* Handle edge cases: If the input array is empty, return False as there are no indices to reach.
* Make sure to initialize the memoization dictionary with default values (e.g., False) before starting the recursive function.

Edge cases:

* Input array is empty
* Last index in the array is not reachable
