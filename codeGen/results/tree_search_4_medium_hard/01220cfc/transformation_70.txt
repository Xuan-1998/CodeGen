===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization for top-down approach: Implement a dictionary or cache to store and reuse previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems.

The state could be the current index i and whether it's possible to reach it (denoted as dp[i]).

Transition relationship:
- If arr[i] >= 1, then dp[i+arr[i]] is True if and only if dp[i] is True
- If arr[i] == 0, then dp[i] is the same as dp[i]

Initial condition: dp[0] = True

Memoization table: dp[i]

Update memoization table:

for i from 1 to n:
    dp[i] = (arr[i] >= 1 and dp[i-arr[i]]) or dp[i-1]

Return dp[n]
