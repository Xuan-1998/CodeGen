Identify potential subproblems: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.

The base case is dp[0] = True because we can always reach the first element (it has no previous elements to jump from).

State: dp[i] represents whether we can reach index i with a maximum reachable jump from previous positions.

Transition relationship: dp[i] = any previous position j <= i where the jump from j can reach i is possible (i.e., dp[j]) and the jump distance at that position is greater than or equal to i - j. This ensures we can always take a valid step to reach index i.

Implement memoization by creating a dictionary dp where the keys are indices and the values are boolean values indicating whether it's possible to reach that index.
