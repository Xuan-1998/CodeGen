===BEGIN PLAN===
Incorporate optimal substructure: Think about how the solution to one subproblem can be used to solve another related subproblem.

The state is dp[i], which represents whether the i-th element can be reached. The base case is dp[0] = True, since we start at the beginning and the maximum reachable index from there is always 0.

dp[i] = or for j in range(0, i+1): dp[j] if j + 1 <= i and arr[j] >= i-j
Design a top-down dynamic programming approach using a function that takes the current index as input, and returns True if it's possible to reach that index.

The recursive relation will be: canReach(i) = or for j in range(0, i+1): dp[j] if j + 1 <= i and arr[j] >= i-j

The base case is: canReach(0) = True
The memoization will be crucial to avoid redundant computation. The function canReach should take the current index as input, and returns True if it's possible to reach that index.
