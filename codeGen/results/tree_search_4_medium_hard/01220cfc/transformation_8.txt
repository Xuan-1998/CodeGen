===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify potential subproblems: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.

The base case is dp[0] = True because we can always reach the first element (it has no previous elements to jump from).

State: dp[i] represents whether it's possible to reach index i.

Transition relationship: dp[i] = True if there exists j in range(0, i) such that the jump from j can reach i, and dp[j] is True.

You can implement tabulation by initializing a dynamic programming table with zeros, where each entry dp[i] represents whether it's possible to reach the i-th index.

For edge cases:
- Handle array with one element: In this case, return True as we can always reach the single element.
- Handle empty array: Return False as there are no elements to jump from.
