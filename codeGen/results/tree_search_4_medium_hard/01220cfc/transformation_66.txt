===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization for top-down approach: Implement a dictionary or cache to store and reuse previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems.

The state could be a tuple of (index, reachable) where index is the current position and reachable is a boolean indicating whether it's possible to reach that index. This simplifies the transition relationship as we only need to consider if the next index is within the jump range of the current index.

One choice: Consider the current index i and its maximum reachable index j (i.e., max(j, arr[j])) as the state. The transition relationship could be defined as 'it is possible to reach the next index if the current index is within the jump range of the maximum reachable index'.

Define a cache function that takes the state as input and returns whether it's possible to reach the next index.

Function memoization: To avoid redundant computation, use dictionary to store previously computed results. The key for the dictionary would be the state (index, reachable) and value would be the result of the function evaluation at that state.

To improve the plan:
1. Consider a base case where if we are already at the last index, then it's possible to reach it.
2. Handle edge cases like empty array or array with only one element by returning False for all states.

The updated version of the entire detailed plan is as follows:
