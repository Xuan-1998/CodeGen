===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify potential subproblems: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.

The base case is dp[0] = True because we can always reach the first element (it has no previous elements to jump from).

State: dp[i] represents whether it's possible to reach index i.
Transition relationship: dp[i] = True if there exists j in range(0, i) such that the jump from j can reach i, and dp[j] is True.

You can use memoization by defining a function that takes an index as input and returns True if it's possible to reach that index, storing previously computed values in a dictionary. 

dp[i] = any(j < i and arr[j] >= i - j for j in range(0, i)) or dp[0]
If we can't reach the current position from the start, try to reach it from earlier positions.
