===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify potential subproblems: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.

The base case is dp[0] = True because we can always reach the first element (it has no previous elements to jump from).

State: dp[i] represents whether it's possible to reach index i without going back in time.
Transition relationship: dp[i] = True if and only if there exists j such that 0 <= j < i, arr[j] >= i - j, and dp[j] is True.

Create a dictionary-based memoization system where each key corresponds to an index in the array and its value is a boolean indicating whether it's possible to reach that index.

For each index i, check if it's possible to reach it by iterating over all previous indices j such that arr[j] >= i - j. If we find such a j and dp[j] is True, then dp[i] should be True. Otherwise, dp[i] should be False.

Edge cases: 
- If the array has only one element, return True because we can always reach the last index.
- If the array is empty, return False because there's no last index to reach.
- If the input array contains a value that exceeds the maximum jump length at any point (i.e., arr[i] > i), consider this as an invalid input and return False.
