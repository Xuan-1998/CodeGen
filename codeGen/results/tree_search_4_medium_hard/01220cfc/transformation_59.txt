===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization for top-down approach: Implement a dictionary or cache to store and reuse previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems.

The state could be a tuple of (current_index, max_reachable_index) to keep track of both indices. This will allow us to keep track of the maximum reachable index as we move through the array.

Represent the current index as the state, with transitions being updates based on the maximum reachable index at each step.
We can update the state by considering the jump length at the current index and the maximum reachable index so far.

Use recursion and memoization to store previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems, with the base case being reaching the last index.

To improve this plan, we could consider adding an early termination condition if it's clear that the goal is unreachable.
We should also ensure that our memoization approach handles edge cases correctly.

For example, what happens when the array is empty? Do we return True or False?
In a similar vein, what about arrays with only one element?
These are important questions to consider when implementing this plan.
