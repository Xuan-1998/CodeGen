===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify potential subproblems: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.

DP states: For each position i, define dp[i] as True if it's possible to reach index i from the start, and False otherwise.
dp[i] is True if there's an index k such that k <= i and arr[k] >= i - k, and also dp[k] is True.

Use a separate list memo to store intermediate results, then fill up the dp table based on these results.

Optimize: Since we only need to know if it's possible to reach the last index, we can terminate early once we encounter an index where it's not possible to reach. This reduces unnecessary computation.

Edge cases:
- Handle array with 0 or 1 elements. It's always possible to reach the end.
- Handle array with 2 elements. If the first element is 0 and the second element is greater than or equal to 1, then it's not possible to reach the end. Otherwise, it is.
