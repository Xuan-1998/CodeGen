===BEGIN PLAN===
Incorporate optimal substructure: Think about how the solution to one subproblem can be used to solve another related subproblem.

The state is dp[i], which represents whether it's possible to reach the i-th index. The base case is dp[0] = True, since we can always start at the beginning.

dp[i] represents whether it's possible to reach the i-th index from the 0th index, so dp[i] = (any j <= i-1 and arr[j] + 1 >= i) or any k < i and dp[k].

Utilize memoization by creating a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and checking if the result is already computed before recalculating it.

To improve the plan, consider sorting the array based on the jump lengths in descending order. This can reduce the number of recursive calls needed to solve the problem.

One potential issue with the plan is that it may not correctly handle edge cases where the input array has a single element or is empty. The base case should be updated to handle these scenarios accordingly.

The updated plan:
