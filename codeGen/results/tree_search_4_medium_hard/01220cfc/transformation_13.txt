===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify potential subproblems: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.
The base case is dp[0] = True because we can always reach the first element (it has no previous elements to jump from).
State: dp[i] represents whether it's possible to reach index i without going back in time.
Transition relationship: dp[i] = any j in range(0, i) such that the jump from j can reach i and we haven't gone back in time (i.e., dp[j] == True).
Use a list comprehension to create an initial table with all False values, then iterate through the array updating the table based on the transition relationship.
Create a variable to keep track of the maximum reachable index at each step. 
Update this variable whenever we find a jump that can reach further than what's currently possible.
The updated version of the plan is:
