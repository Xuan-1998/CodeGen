===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization for top-down approach: Implement a dictionary or cache to store and reuse previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems.

The state could be the current index, i, and the value at that index represents whether it's possible to reach the last index from there. The special case is when i is equal to the length of the array minus one (the last element), where the state is also the last index and the value at that index represents whether it's possible to reach the last index.

The transition relationship could be whether the maximum reachable index from the previous position, j, is greater than or equal to the current position i. If yes, then we can potentially reach the current index; otherwise, we cannot.

Store previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems in a dictionary or cache using memoization, and use it to avoid recomputing same subproblems.
