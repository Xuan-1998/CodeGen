===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify potential subproblems: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.

Define dp[i] as True if for some j in [0, i-1], dp[j] is True and jumps[i-1] >= i - j. This means that there's a way to reach index i by jumping from some earlier position.
dp[i] = or [dp[j] and j + jumps[j] >= i for j in range(i-1)]

Create a dynamic programming table where each cell represents whether it's possible to reach the current index based on previous indices

Initialize dp[0] to True since it's always possible to reach the first index
dp[0] = True
