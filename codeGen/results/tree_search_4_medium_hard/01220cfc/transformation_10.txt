===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify potential subproblems: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.

The base case is dp[0] = True because we can always reach the first element (it has no previous elements to jump from).

State: dp[i] represents whether we can reach index i with a maximum reachable jump from previous positions. Transition relationship: dp[i] = any previous position j <= i where the jump from j can reach i is possible (i.e., dp[j]).

Use dynamic programming to create a 1D array where each cell dp[i] represents whether it's possible to reach index i with the maximum reachable jump from previous positions. The transition relationship remains the same: dp[i] = any previous position j <= i where the jump from j can reach i is possible (i.e., dp[j]).

The final answer will be dp[n-1], where n is the length of the array, indicating whether it's possible to reach the last index.
