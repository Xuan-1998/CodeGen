===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization for top-down approach: Implement a dictionary or cache to store and reuse previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems.

The state could be a tuple of (current_index, max_reachable_index) to keep track of both indices. This allows us to efficiently calculate the maximum reachable index at each step, considering all possible jumps from previous indices.

Use a priority queue to prioritize jumps from the start of the array, keeping track of visited indices and maximum reachable index at each step. This ensures that we explore the most promising paths first, reducing the number of unnecessary calculations.

To further optimize our approach, we can maintain a set of visited indices, ensuring that we don't revisit previously explored states.

Finally, we check if it's possible to reach the last index by verifying that the maximum reachable index at the last index is equal to or greater than the length of the array minus one (since indexing starts from 0). If this condition holds true, then it's possible to reach the last index; otherwise, it's not.
