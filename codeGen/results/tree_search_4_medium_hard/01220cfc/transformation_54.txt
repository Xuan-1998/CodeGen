===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization for top-down approach: Implement a dictionary or cache to store and reuse previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems.

The state could be the current index, and the value at that index represents the maximum reachable index from there. This means we can use a dictionary where the keys are indices and the values are the maximum reachable indices from those positions.

Develop a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary to store intermediate results. 

1. Define the base case: If the current index is equal to the last index, return True because you have reached the end of the array.
2. Initialize a dictionary to store the maximum reachable indices for each position in the array.
3. Define the recursive function that takes an index as input and returns whether it's possible to reach the last index from that position:
   - If the current index is out of bounds or has been reached before, return the stored result from the dictionary.
   - Otherwise, calculate the maximum reachable index from this position by considering all reachable positions with a jump length less than or equal to the value at the current index. Update the dictionary with the calculated value.
   - If it's possible to reach the last index from this position, return True; otherwise, return False.

4. Call the recursive function with the first index of the array and check if the result is True. If not, you can't reach the last index, so return False.

This plan correctly captures the essence of the problem and takes into account edge cases where it's impossible to reach the end of the array.
