===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization for top-down approach: Implement a dictionary or cache to store and reused previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems.

The state could be a tuple of (current_index, max_reachable_index) to keep track of both indices. This is a good start, but we can improve it by using only the current index as the state. The maximum reachable index at each step will be updated accordingly.

Represent the current index as the state, with transitions being updates based on the maximum reachable index at each step.

Create a bottom-up dynamic programming table where dp[i] represents whether it's possible to reach index i.

Initialize dp[0] to True, since we can always start from the first element.

For each index i from 1 to n-1:

    If the current element is larger than or equal to i - j (where j is the maximum reachable index at previous step), update dp[i] to True. This means if we have reached i - j in the previous step and can jump to the current index, then it's possible to reach the current index.

    Otherwise, update dp[i] to False.

Finally, return dp[n-1], which represents whether it's possible to reach the last index.
