===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify potential subproblems: Consider breaking down the problem into smaller instances of the same problem, where each instance has a unique set of inputs.

Define dp[i] as True if for some j in [0, i-1], dp[j] is True and jumps[i-1] >= i - j. This means that there's a way to reach index i by jumping from some earlier position.
dp[i] = any dp[j] where j < i and j + jumps[j] >= i

Use memoization by defining a dictionary dp where keys are indices and values are boolean values indicating whether it's possible to reach that index.

For initialization, set dp[0] to True since we can always reach the first index.
dp[i] = False for all i > 0 initially, as we haven't checked if it's possible to reach those indices yet

Iterate from i = len(jumps) - 1 down to i = 0:
    If jumps[i] >= i: dp[i] should be True since we can always reach the current index
    For j in range(0, i):
        If dp[j] and i <= j + jumps[j]: set dp[i] to True

Return dp[-1]
