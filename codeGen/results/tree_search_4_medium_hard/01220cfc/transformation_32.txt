===BEGIN PLAN===
Incorporate optimal substructure: Think about how the solution to one subproblem can be used to solve another related subproblem.

The state is dp[i], which represents whether it's possible to reach the i-th index. The base case is dp[0] = True, since we can always start at the beginning.
dp[i] is the maximum jump length at index i minus one, considering only the indices reachable from the previous steps.

Create a top-down dynamic programming approach with a recursive function and a dictionary-based memoization.
Memoize the recursive calls by storing the results in a dictionary dp_dict.
When calculating dp[i], consider all possible jumps from the previous indices j such that j <= i - jump_length, where jump_length is the maximum jump length at index j. If any of these jumps lead to an index reachable from the previous steps and the corresponding dp[j] is True, then set dp[i] = True.
