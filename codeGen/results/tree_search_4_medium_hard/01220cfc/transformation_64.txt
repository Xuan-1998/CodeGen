===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization for top-down approach: Implement a dictionary or cache to store and reuse previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems.

The state could be the current index i and whether it's possible to reach it. 

One choice: Consider the current index i and its maximum reachable index j (i.e., max(j, arr[j])) as the state. The transition relationship could be defined as 'it is possible to reach the next index if the current index is within the jump range of the maximum reachable index'.

Use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and check if a state has been computed before.

For the base case, consider the first element in the array; it's always possible to reach the first index (base case).

To avoid redundant computation, update the memoization table with the result of each subproblem.

The final answer would be the value stored at the last index in the memoization table.

This plan is correct and should work well. It avoids redundant computation by storing previously computed results and uses a top-down approach to solve the problem.
