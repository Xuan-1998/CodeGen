===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization for top-down approach:
    * Implement a dictionary or cache to store and reuse previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems.
    * The state could be a tuple of (current_index, max_reachable_index) to keep track of both indices.
    * Represent the current index as the state, with transitions being updates based on the maximum reachable index at each step.
    * Implement a top-down approach using a dictionary or cache to store and reuse previously computed solutions for overlapping subproblems, 
      with the state being a tuple of (current_index, max_reachable_index).
    * Initialize the memoization table with base cases: if current_index is equal to the last index, return True; otherwise, return False.
    * Define the recursive function that takes the current index and updates the maximum reachable index based on the array values at each step.
      * If the current index plus jump_length is within the bounds of the array and less than or equal to max_reachable_index,
        update max_reachable_index with the minimum value between the new maximum reachable index and the length of the array.
    * Return True if max_reachable_index reaches the last index; otherwise, return False.
