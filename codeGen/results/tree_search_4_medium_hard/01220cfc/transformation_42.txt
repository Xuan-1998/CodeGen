===BEGIN PLAN===
Incorporate optimal substructure:
Think about how the solution to one subproblem can be used to solve another related subproblem.

The state is dp[i], which represents whether the i-th element can be reached. The base case is dp[0] = True, since we start at the beginning and the maximum reachable index from there is always 0.

dp[i] represents whether the i-th element can be reached if dp[j] is True for all j < i - arr[i], meaning that we have reached the (i-1)-th index.

Implement memoization using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and avoid recomputation. This will help in reducing the time complexity by avoiding repeated computation of the same subproblem.

Note: The plan does not consider the edge case where the array is empty or only contains one element, as it is not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement. To handle this, we can add an additional base case dp[0] = True and dp[1] = arr[0] > 0 to cover these cases.
