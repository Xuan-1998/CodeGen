===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up dynamic programming with tabulation. The state transition function will calculate the minimum points required to reach a cell from its top-left or left-top neighbor.

Consider a state expression like dp[i][j] = minimum positive points in cells reachable from cell (i, j) with positive points. The base case could be dp[M-1][N-1] = positive points in the destination cell.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

Using a 2D array to store the state transitions and calculate the minimum points required to reach each cell. The time complexity would be O(M*N) as we need to fill up the dp table for all cells.

To handle edge cases, we can add base cases for the top row and left column. For example, for the top row, dp[0][j] = grid[0][j], because we can only move right from the top row, and similarly for the left column, dp[i][0] = grid[i][0].

Finally, to find the minimum initial points required to reach the destination cell with minimum positive points, we just need to return dp[M-1][N-1].
