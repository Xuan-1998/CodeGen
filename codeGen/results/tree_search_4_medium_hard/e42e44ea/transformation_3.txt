===BEGIN PLAN===
DP states can be defined as (i, j) where i is the current row index and j is the current column index. Memoization can be used to store intermediate results.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) - 1 if grid[i][j] < 0, else âˆž
Use a dictionary to store intermediate results, where keys are (i, j) and values are the minimum points required to reach that cell.

Note: The plan correctly identifies dynamic programming as the approach for solving this problem. It also captures the essence of the dp state transition equation. However, it might be more accurate to consider the dp state as (i, j, p), where p is the current point value, instead of just i and j.

The dictionary-based memoization can help in storing and retrieving intermediate results efficiently. The plan does not explicitly handle edge cases but the DP approach should naturally capture all possible scenarios.
