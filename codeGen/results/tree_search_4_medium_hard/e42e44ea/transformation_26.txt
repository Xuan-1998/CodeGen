===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up dynamic programming with tabulation. The state transition function will calculate the minimum points required to reach a cell from its top-left or left-top neighbor.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = minimum points required to reach cell (i, j). The base case would be dp[0][0] = the initial points in the top-left cell.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

Implement a tabulation approach by initializing a 2D array with zeros and filling it up in a bottom-up manner, from top to bottom and left to right. The final result will be stored at dp[N-1][M-1].
