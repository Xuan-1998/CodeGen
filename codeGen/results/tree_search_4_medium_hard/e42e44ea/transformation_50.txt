===BEGIN PLAN===
DP states can be defined as (points, i, j) where points is the current sum of points and i, j are the current row and column indices respectively. 
Top-down memoization with DFS can be used to explore all possible paths.

dp[i][j] = { (i == 0) ? (grid[0][j]) : (min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])), 
             (j == 0) ? (grid[i][0]) : (dp[i][j-1]) }

Create a 2D array dp of size (N+1) x (M+1) to store the cumulative points required for each cell. Then, iterate through each cell and calculate the cumulative points required by adding the current cell's value to the minimum of the cumulative points required from the top or left cell.

Let's add some base cases:
- If we're at the first row, dp[i][j] = grid[0][j]
- If we're at the first column, dp[i][j] = grid[i][0]

Now let's define the recurrence relation:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

Finally, initialize the base cases and return dp[N-1][M-1]
