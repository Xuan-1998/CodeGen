===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up dynamic programming with tabulation. The state transition function will calculate the minimum points required to reach a cell from its top-left or left-top neighbor.

Consider a state expression like dp[i][j] = minimum positive points in cells reachable from cell (i, j) with positive points. The base case could be dp[M-1][N-1] = positive points in the destination cell.

dp[i][j] = max(0, min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]))) + grid[i][j]

Create a 2D array of size N x M initialized with -∞ values and update the base case as you iterate through the cells. The actual minimum points required to reach the destination cell is stored in dp[M-1][N-1].

The initial state for dp[i][j] should be updated according to the rules:
    1. If the current cell has positive points (grid[i][j] > 0), update dp[i][j] with grid[i][j].
    2. If the current cell does not have positive points, keep the initial value -∞.
