===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up dynamic programming with tabulation. The state transition function will calculate the minimum points required to reach a cell from its top-left or left-top neighbor.

Consider a state expression like dp[i][j] = minimum positive points in cells reachable from cell (i, j) with positive points. The base case could be dp[M-1][N-1] = positive points in the destination cell.

dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] if i == 0 or j == 0 else min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

Use a 2D array with the size of N x M to store the minimum points required to reach each cell. Initialize all cells in the first row and column to their corresponding values in the grid, since they can only be reached by moving right or down.

To handle edge cases, consider the scenario where M = 1 or N = 1 (i.e., a single-row or single-column grid). In this case, the minimum points required would simply be the positive point value at the top-left cell.

Finally, to avoid potential issues with negative points, ensure that the state transition function only considers cells with positive points when calculating the minimum points required to reach each cell.
