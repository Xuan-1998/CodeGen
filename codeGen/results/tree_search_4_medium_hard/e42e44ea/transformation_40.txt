===BEGIN PLAN===
DP states can be defined as (points, i, j) where points is the current sum of points and i, j are the current row and column indices respectively. Top-down memoization with DFS can be used to explore all possible paths.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

The minimum points required to reach the cell at row i, column j is the minimum of the points required to reach the cell above it (i-1, j) plus the points in that cell and the points required to reach the cell to its left (i, j-1) plus the points in that cell, or 0 if there are no cells above or to the left. This state can be denoted as dp[i][j].

Define a recursive DFS function that explores all possible paths and updates the dp state accordingly.

For each cell (i, j), explore all possible paths from the top-left cell to it.
If the current cell has positive points, recursively call the DFS function for the cells above and to the left.
Update the dp[i][j] state with the minimum of the points required to reach the cell above it and the cell to its left, plus the points in the current cell.

The final answer is dp[N-1][M-1].
