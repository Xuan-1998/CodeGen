===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up dynamic programming with tabulation. The state transition function will calculate the minimum points required to reach a cell from its top-left or left-top neighbor.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = minimum points required to reach cell (i, j). The base case would be dp[0][0] = 0, because we start with 0 initial points in the top-left cell.

For cells that are not at the top edge (i > 0), the transition function could be:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

The memoization dictionary can store the state values, where keys are (i, j) and values are the minimum points required to reach cell (i, j).

Edge cases include handling when i or j is 0.
