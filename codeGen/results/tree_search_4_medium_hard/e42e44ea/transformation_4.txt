DP states can be defined as (i, j) where i is the current row index and j is the current column index. Memoization can be used to store intermediate results.
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) if grid[i][j] > 0, else âˆž
else: 
    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) - 1
Create a 2D array of size N x M filled with infinity, then update each cell as you traverse the grid based on the rules provided.
