===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up dynamic programming with tabulation. The state transition function will calculate the minimum points required to reach a cell from its top-left or left-top neighbor.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = minimum points required to reach cell (i, j). The base case would be dp[0][0] = 0, since we start at the top-left cell with no initial points.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

Use a bottom-up approach with tabulation by initializing a 2D array of size N x M with all cells initialized to infinity, then update each cell based on its top-left or left-top neighbor.

The final answer would be dp[N-1][M-1], the minimum points required to reach the bottom-right cell.
