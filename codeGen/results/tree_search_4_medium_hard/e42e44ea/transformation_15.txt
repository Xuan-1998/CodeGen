===BEGIN PLAN===
DP states can be defined as dp[i][j] = the minimum initial points required to reach cell (i, j). Memoization can be used to store intermediate results.

dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]

for i in range(1, N):
    for j in range(1, M):
        if grid[i][j] > 0:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
        else:
            dp[i][j] = float('inf') # or any other value to represent unreachable cells

Memoization with Dynamic Programming: Store the minimum initial points required for each cell in a dictionary and use it to avoid redundant calculations.
