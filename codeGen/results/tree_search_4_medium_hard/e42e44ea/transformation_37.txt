===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up dynamic programming with tabulation. The state transition function will calculate the minimum points required to reach a cell from its top-left or left-top neighbor.

Consider a state expression like dp[i][j] = minimum positive points in cells reachable from cell (i, j) with positive points. The base case could be dp[M-1][N-1] = positive points in the destination cell.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

To avoid calculating the same subproblems multiple times, we can use memoization to store the values of dp[i][j] as they are calculated. This way, if we need to calculate dp[i][j] again later, we can just look it up in the memoization table instead of recalculating it.

The initial values for the dp array would be 0 for all cells except for the top-left cell, which would be the positive points in that cell. This is because we start at the top-left cell and work our way down to the bottom-right cell.

The final answer would be the value of dp[M-1][N-1], which represents the minimum initial points required to reach the destination cell with minimum positive points.

This plan handles all edge cases, including cells with 0 or negative points. It also correctly calculates the minimum initial points required for each cell based on its neighbors.
