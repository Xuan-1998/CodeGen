DP states can be defined as (points, i, j) where points is the current sum of points and i, j are the current row and column indices respectively. Top-down memoization with DFS can be used to explore all possible paths.

dp[(0, 0)] = grid[0][0]
for each cell in the grid:
    for each possible move (right or down):
        if moving right:
            dp[(i, j+1)] = min(dp[(i, j+1)], dp[(i, j)] + grid[i][j])
        else:
            dp[(i+1, j)] = min(dp[(i+1, j)], dp[(i, j)] + grid[i][j])

The state can be defined as (i, j) and the transition relation is based on whether we move down or right. If we move down, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + grid[i][j]. If we move right, dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + grid[i][j].

Create a memoization dictionary that maps states to values, where the state is represented as (i, j) and the value is the minimum points required to reach that cell. The base cases are when i or j is 0, and for each cell, find the minimum points required by exploring all possible paths from the top-left cell.

The plan is mostly correct but can be improved:

* Initialize dp[(0, 0)] = grid[0][0] as it's the starting point.
* Use a memoization dictionary that maps states to values instead of creating a 2D array for dp.
* Define the base cases correctly as when i or j is 0 and not just initializing all values in the dp array.

This plan includes edge cases by considering all possible movements from the top-left cell. However, it can be improved further:

* Handle cases where there are no valid paths to reach a cell (i.e., points become negative).
* Consider using BFS instead of DFS for this problem.
