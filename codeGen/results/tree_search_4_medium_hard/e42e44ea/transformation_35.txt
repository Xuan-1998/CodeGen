===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up dynamic programming with tabulation. The state transition function will calculate the minimum points required to reach a cell from its top-left or left-top neighbor.

Consider a state expression like dp[i][j] = minimum positive points in cells reachable from cell (i, j) with positive points. The base case could be dp[M-1][N-1] = positive points in the destination cell.

dp[0][j] = grid[0][j]
dp[i][0] = grid[i][0]

for i from 1 to M-1:
    for j from 1 to N-1:
        dp[i][j] = max(0, min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])) + grid[i][j]

return dp[M-1][N-1]
