===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up dynamic programming with tabulation. The state transition function will calculate the minimum points required to reach a cell from its top-left or left-top neighbor.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = minimum points required to reach cell (i, j). The base case would be dp[0][0] = the initial points in the top-left cell.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j] if i > 0 and j > 0

Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum points required to reach cell (i, j).

If a cell has zero or negative points, it should not be included in the state transition function. This can be achieved by adding an if condition to check if grid[i][j] > 0 before updating the dp value.

The base case would also need to consider the initial points in the top-left cell, which is typically represented as dp[0][0].

To handle edge cases, ensure that the dynamic programming table is initialized with infinite values for all cells except the top-left cell, which should be set to the initial points. This ensures that the algorithm will always choose the optimal path.

The time complexity of this plan would be O(N*M) where N and M are the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively. The space complexity is also O(N*M) for storing the dynamic programming table.
