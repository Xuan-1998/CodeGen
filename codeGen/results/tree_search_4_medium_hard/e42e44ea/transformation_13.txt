===BEGIN PLAN===
DP states can be defined as (i, j) where i is the current row index and j is the current column index. Memoization can be used to store intermediate results.

dp[i][j] = min({ max(0, dp[i-1][j]) if j > 0 else 0 } + { max(0, dp[i][j-1]) if i > 0 else 0 } + grid[i][j], { dp[i-1][j] + grid[i][j] } + { dp[i][j-1] + grid[i][j] })
Use a dictionary to store the minimum initial points required to reach each cell in the grid, with the key being the current position (i, j).
