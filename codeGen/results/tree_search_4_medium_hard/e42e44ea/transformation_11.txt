DP states can be defined as (i, j) where i is the current row index and j is the current column index. Memoization can be used to store intermediate results.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

memo = {(i, j): min(memo.get((i-1, j), float('inf')), memo.get((i, j-1), float('inf'))) + grid[i][j] for i in range(N) for j in range(M)}
