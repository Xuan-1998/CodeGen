===BEGIN PLAN===
DP states can be defined as (points, i, j) where points is the current sum of points and i, j are the current row and column indices respectively. Top-down memoization with DFS can be used to explore all possible paths.
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
Define a state s = (i, j) as the minimum points required to reach the cell at row i and column j. The transition relationship is that if we can reach the cell at row i-1 and column j with k points, then we can also reach the cell at row i and column j with k+grid[i][j] points. Similarly, if we can reach the cell at row i and column j-1 with l points, then we can also reach the cell at row i and column j with l+grid[i][j] points.
Initialize a 2D array dp with all values set to infinity except for dp[0][0] which is set to 0. The base case is that dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since we can always reach the first row with 0 points. Similarly, dp[i][0] = 0 for all i, since we can always reach the first column with 0 points.
Iterate through each cell in the grid, updating dp[i][j] as min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]. The output of this function will be dp[N-1][M-1], which is the minimum initial points required to reach the destination cell with minimum positive points.
