Potential issues with the plan:
1. It doesn't handle negative points correctly. For example, if there are -10^9 points in a cell, it will affect the result negatively. 
2. It assumes that all cells have non-negative points, which may not be the case.
3. The plan does not consider edge cases where N or M is 0.

What is the next step you would take?
1. Write code based on this plan
2. Improve the plan by handling negative points and edge cases
