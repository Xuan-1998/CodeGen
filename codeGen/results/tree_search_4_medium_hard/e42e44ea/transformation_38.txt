===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up dynamic programming with tabulation. The state transition function will calculate the minimum points required to reach a cell from its top-left or left-top neighbor.

Consider a state expression like dp[i][j] = minimum positive points in cells reachable from cell (i, j) with positive points. The base case could be dp[M-1][N-1] = positive points in the destination cell.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

Implement a tabulation solution by initializing the first row and column of the 2D array, then iterate through the rest of the cells in a bottom-up manner. For edge cases, initialize the first row and column with the corresponding values from the grid.
