===BEGIN PLAN===
DP states can be defined as (points, i, j) where points is the current sum of points and i, j are the current row and column indices respectively. Bottom-up Dynamic Programming with DFS can be used to explore all possible paths.

dp[i][j] = min({ dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1] }) + grid[i][j]

Consider a 2D array dp of size (M+1) x (N+1), where dp[i][j] represents the minimum initial points required to reach the cell at position (i, j). The base case is dp[M][N], which should be equal to the value in the cell.

The transition relationship can be implemented using DFS. Start from the top-left cell and explore all possible paths by moving either down or right. For each cell, calculate the minimum initial points required to reach it by taking the minimum of the points required to reach the cell above it and the cell to its left, then add the value in the current cell.
