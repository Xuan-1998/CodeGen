===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up dynamic programming with tabulation and memoization. The state transition function will calculate the minimum points required to reach a cell from its top-left or left-top neighbor.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = minimum points required to reach cell (i, j). The base case would be dp[0][0] = 0, since we start with no initial points in the top-left cell.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j] if i > 0 and j > 0

To improve the plan, we can add a check to handle edge cases where i or j is equal to 0. This would ensure that we don't try to access cells outside the grid.

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + grid[i][j] if i > 0 and j == 0
dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + grid[i][j] if i == 0 and j > 0

By adding these edge cases, we ensure that our plan handles all possible scenarios and doesn't result in any runtime errors.
