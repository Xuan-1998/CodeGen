DP states can be defined as (i, j) where i is the current row index and j is the current column index. Memoization can be used to store intermediate results.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
dp[0][0] = 0

Initialize dp[][] table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum points required to reach cell (i, j) from the top-left cell.

for i in range(1, N):
    for j in range(1, M):
        if grid[i][j] > 0:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
