===BEGIN PLAN===
DP states can be defined as (i, j) where i is the current row index and j is the current column index. Memoization can be used to store intermediate results.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
if grid[i][j] > 0:
    for k in range(i):
        if dp[k][j] > 0:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[k][j])
    for m in range(j):
        if dp[i][m] > 0:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][m])

Use a 2D array to store the minimum points required to reach each cell, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum points required to reach the cell at row i and column j.
