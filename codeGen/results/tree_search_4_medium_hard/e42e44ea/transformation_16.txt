===BEGIN PLAN===
DP states can be defined as (i, j) where i is the current row index and j is the current column index. Memoization can be used to store intermediate results.

dp[i][j] = min({ dp[k][j] for k in range(i) if k >= 0 and grid[k][j] > 0 } or { dp[i][m] for m in range(j) if m >= 0 and grid[i][m] > 0 }, grid[i][j])

This plan is correct. It correctly captures the minimum initial points required to reach each cell, considering only movements that are allowed (right or down) and ensuring that the final cell is reached with minimum positive points.

To improve this plan, we can add some edge cases: what happens if the starting cell has a negative point value? What about if there's no path to the destination cell?
