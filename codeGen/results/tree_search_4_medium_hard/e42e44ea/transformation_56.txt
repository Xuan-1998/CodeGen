DP states can be defined as (points, i, j) where points is the current sum of points and i, j are the current row and column indices respectively. Top-down memoization with DFS can be used to explore all possible paths.

dp[i][j] = { 
  if (i == 0) ? 
    (grid[0][j]) : 
    (dp[i-1][j]), 
  if (j == 0) ? 
    (grid[i][0]) : 
    (dp[i][j-1])
}

Define the state as (i, j, points) where points is the current sum of points. The transition relation can be defined as: 

if (i > 0 and j > 0), then 
  dp[i][j][points] = min(dp[i-1][j][points + grid[i][j]], dp[i][j-1][points + grid[i][j]]) + grid[i][j];

Determine the minimum initial points required by performing a depth-first search and storing the results of each node in a dictionary.

Let's say we want to find the minimum initial points for reaching cell (m, n) with positive points. We can start from cell (0, 0), traverse downwards or rightwards, and keep track of the minimum points required at each cell. The base case is when we reach the target cell (m, n).

This plan looks correct! It uses dynamic programming to solve the problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.

To improve this plan, you could consider using memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computation. This can significantly speed up the algorithm for larger inputs.

One potential issue with this plan is that it doesn't handle edge cases correctly. For example, what if we try to move out of the grid? We should add checks at each step to ensure that we're only moving within the grid boundaries.
