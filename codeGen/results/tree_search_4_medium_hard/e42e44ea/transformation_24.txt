===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up dynamic programming with tabulation. The state transition function will calculate the minimum points required to reach a cell from its top-left or left-top neighbor.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = minimum points required to reach cell (i, j). The base case would be dp[0][0] = 0, since we start with 0 initial points in the top-left cell.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) if i > 0 and j > 0
Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming state, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum points required to reach cell (i, j).

For edge cases:
- If N or M is 1, the minimum initial points would be 0, since we can only move down or right.
- If there are cells with negative points, we should skip them and only consider positive points.

This plan seems correct, but it could be improved by adding more detailed explanations of the state transition function and edge cases. The plan also assumes that the input grid is valid (i.e., N > 0, M > 0), which might not always be the case.
