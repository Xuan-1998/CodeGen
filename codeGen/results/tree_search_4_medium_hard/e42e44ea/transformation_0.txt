===BEGIN PLAN===
DP states can be defined as (i, j) where i is the current row index and j is the current column index. Memoization can be used to store intermediate results.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

for each cell at position (i, j):
    if grid[i][j] > 0:
        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1
    else:
        dp[i][j] = -âˆž

Use a 2D array to store the minimum points required to reach each cell, and update it using the minimum of the top cell and the left cell plus the current cell's value.
