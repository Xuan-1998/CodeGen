===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up dynamic programming with tabulation. The state transition function will calculate the minimum points required to reach a cell from its top-left or left-top neighbor.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = minimum points required to reach cell (i, j). The base case would be dp[0][0] = the initial points in the top-left cell.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

The plan includes edge cases. For example, for cells at the edges of the grid (top or left), we only need to consider one neighbor (either above or to the left).

This plan should work correctly, but it could be improved by adding a check to ensure that the minimum points required to reach a cell is not negative (since points cannot be negative). This can be done by initializing dp[i][0] = 0 and dp[0][j] = 0 for j in [1, M-1], as cells at the left edge of the grid will only have positive points.
