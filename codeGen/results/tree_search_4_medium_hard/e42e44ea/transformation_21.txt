===BEGIN PLAN===
DP states can be defined as (i, j) where i is the current row index and j is the current column index. Memoization can be used to store intermediate results.

dp[i][j] = min( { dp[k][j] for k in range(i-1, -1, -1) if dp[k][j] > 0 } or { dp[i][m] for m in range(j-1, -1, -1) if dp[i][m] > 0 }, grid[i][j])

Use a nested loop to fill in the dp array.

for i in range(N):
    for j in range(M):
        if i == 0 and j == 0:
            dp[i][j] = grid[i][j]
        elif i > 0 and j > 0:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[max(0, i-1)][j], dp[i][max(0, j-1)]) + grid[i][j]
        else:
            if i == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[0][min(j+1, M-1)] + grid[i][j]
            elif j == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[min(i+1, N-1)][0] + grid[i][j]
