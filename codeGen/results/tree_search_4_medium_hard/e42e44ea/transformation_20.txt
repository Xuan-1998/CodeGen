DP states can be defined as (i, j) where i is the current row index and j is the current column index. Memoization can be used to store intermediate results.

dp[i][j] = min({ dp[k][j] for k in range(i-1, -1, -1) if k >= 0 and dp[k][j] > 0 } or { dp[i][m] for m in range(j-1, -1, -1) if m >= 0 and dp[i][m] > 0 }, grid[i][j])

Use a dictionary to store the intermediate results.

memo = {(0, 0): grid[0][0]}
for i in range(1, N):
    for j in range(1, M):
        memo[(i, j)] = min({ dp[k][j] for k in range(i) if k >= 0 and dp[k][j] > 0 } or { dp[i][m] for m in range(j) if m >= 0 and dp[i][m] > 0 }, grid[i][j])

The minimum initial points required to reach the destination cell with minimum positive points is memo[(N-1, M-1)].
