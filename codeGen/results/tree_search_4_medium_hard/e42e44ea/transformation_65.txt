DP states can be defined as (points, i, j) where points is the current sum of points and i, j are the current row and column indices respectively. Bottom-up dynamic programming can be used to explore all possible paths.

dp[i][j] = min({ dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1] }) + grid[i][j]

Use a priority queue to keep track of cells with the maximum positive points. Start from the top-left cell and explore all possible paths in a bottom-up manner, updating the minimum initial points required.

Prioritize the cells with the highest positive points first, ensuring that we always choose the path with the most points whenever possible.

In the end, return dp[N-1][M-1], which represents the minimum initial points required to reach the bottom-right cell.
