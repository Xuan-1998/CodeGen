===BEGIN PLAN===
DP states can be defined as (points, i, j) where points is the current sum of points and i, j are the current row and column indices respectively. 

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
The current minimum points required to reach the bottom-right cell is the minimum of the points required to reach any cell in the previous row and the points required to reach any cell in the same column, plus the points in the current cell. 

Another approach is to use tabulation by initializing a 2D table dp of size N x M and filling it up row by row or column by column, starting from the top-left cell. Each cell in the dp table represents the minimum points required to reach that cell.
