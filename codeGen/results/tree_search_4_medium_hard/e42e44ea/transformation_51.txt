===BEGIN PLAN===
DP states can be defined as (points, i, j) where points is the current sum of points and i, j are the current row and column indices respectively. Top-down memoization with DFS can be used to explore all possible paths.

dp[i][j] = {
  (i == 0) ? grid[0][j] : 
  ((j == 0) ? grid[i][0] : 
    min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j])
}

The state can be defined as (i, j) and the transition relation is based on whether we move down or right. If we move down, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + grid[i][j]. If we move right, dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + grid[i][j].

Define a 2D array dp of size N x M initialized with all values equal to infinity (or any other impossible value), then update dp[i][j] based on the rules given in the problem statement. The base cases are when i or j is 0, and for each cell, find the minimum points required by exploring all possible paths from the top-left cell.
