===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up dynamic programming with tabulation. The state transition function will calculate the minimum points required to reach a cell from its top-left or left-top neighbor.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = minimum points required to reach cell (i, j). The base case would be dp[0][0] = 0, representing the initial points in the top-left cell. We need to make sure that the final result is the minimum initial points required to reach the bottom-right cell with positive points.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) if i > 0 and j > 0
Memoize the function that calculates the minimum points required to reach a cell from its top-left or left-top neighbor.

The final result would be dp[M-1][N-1], representing the minimum initial points required to reach the bottom-right cell with positive points.
