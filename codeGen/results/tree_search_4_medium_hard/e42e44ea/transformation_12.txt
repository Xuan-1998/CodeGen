===BEGIN PLAN===
DP states can be defined as (i, j) where i is the current row index and j is the current column index. Memoization can be used to store intermediate results.

dp[i][j] = min(0, dp[i-1][j]) + min(grid[i][j], 0)
Create a separate array for memoized values and use it to store intermediate results.
