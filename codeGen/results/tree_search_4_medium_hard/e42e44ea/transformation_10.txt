DP states can be defined as (i, j) where i is the current row index and j is the current column index. Memoization can be used to store intermediate results.

dp[i][j] = { 
    if j > 0: max(0, dp[i-1][j]) + grid[i][j], 
    else: 0 
} + { 
    if i > 0: max(0, dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j], 
    else: 0 
}
dp[0][0] = 0
