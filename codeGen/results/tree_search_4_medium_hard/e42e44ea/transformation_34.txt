===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up dynamic programming with tabulation. The state transition function will calculate the minimum points required to reach a cell from its top-left or left-top neighbor.

Consider a state expression like dp[i][j] = minimum positive points in cells reachable from cell (i, j) with positive points. The base case could be dp[M-1][N-1] = positive points in the destination cell.

dp[i][j] = max(0, min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])) + grid[i][j]

Use a dictionary to store the minimum points required to reach each cell and look up previously computed values when needed. This approach helps avoid redundant calculations by storing intermediate results.

Initialize the first row (i=0) and the first column (j=0) with their respective positive points, as there's no need for initial points in these cases.

Iterate over the grid from top-left to bottom-right, updating the state values accordingly. For each cell, calculate the minimum points required to reach it by considering its top-left or left-top neighbor and adding the points of the current cell.

Finally, return dp[M-1][N-1] as the minimum initial points required to reach the destination cell with minimum positive points.
