===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up dynamic programming with tabulation. The state transition function will calculate the minimum points required to reach a cell from its top-left or left-top neighbor.

Consider a state expression like dp[i][j] = minimum positive points in cells reachable from cell (i, j) with positive points. The base case could be dp[M-1][N-1] = positive points in the destination cell.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

To avoid redundant calculations, we can use a memoization dictionary to store previously calculated values.

The plan also needs to consider edge cases. For example, when i or j is 0, it means the cell is at the top-left border and only one direction (right or down) is possible. In this case, dp[0][j] = grid[0][j] and dp[i][0] = grid[i][0].

In addition, we should handle the case when a cell has 0 points. In this case, it's not possible to reach that cell with positive points.
