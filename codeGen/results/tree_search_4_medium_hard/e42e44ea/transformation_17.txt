===BEGIN PLAN===
DP states can be defined as (i, j) where i is the current row index and j is the current column index. Memoization can be used to store intermediate results.

dp[i][j] = min({ dp[k][j-1] for k in range(i) if k >= 0 and grid[k][j-1] > 0 } or { dp[i-1][m] for m in range(j) if m >= 0 and grid[i-1][m] > 0 }, grid[i][j])

The plan is almost correct, but it seems to be missing a crucial detail. The movement can only be done right or down, not diagonally.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the DP states are updated correctly based on the possible movements. 

Another potential improvement would be to add edge cases for when i == 0 or j == 0, as these cells do not have any previous cell to come from, but they still should be considered in the minimum path.

The updated plan:
