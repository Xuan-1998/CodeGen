===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming can solve this problem by defining a state that represents the maximum amount of money earned for each possible table configuration and total amount of money spent.

The base case would be when there are no more tables or no more money to spend, then return 0.

Then, use tabulation to fill in the states in bottom-up manner:

dp[0][i] = 0 for i in range(k+1)
for j in range(1, n+1):
    dp[j][i] = max(dp[j-1][i], sum(max(pi * min(k, ci) for pi, ci in zip(requests[:j], group_sizes[:j]), i))

Transition: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], pi * min(k, ci)) for each request

Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing the dp table and filling it in from left to right.
