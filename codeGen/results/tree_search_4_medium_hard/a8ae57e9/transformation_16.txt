===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming: The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by defining a state that keeps track of the maximum amount of money earned for each group size, and the minimum number of tables required to accommodate all groups with sizes up to the current group size. Then, use tabulation or memoization to fill in the states in bottom-up manner.

The state expression is a tuple (i, j) where i represents the maximum amount of money earned by accepting groups up to size k-i and j represents the number of tables required to accommodate all groups with sizes up to k-i. The transition relationship is that if we accept the current request, the new state will be (i + ci * pi, min(j, k - 1)). If we decline the current request, the new state will be (i, j).

Implement a function that uses memoization to find the maximum amount of money earned by accepting or declining each request in order, considering the state transition relationship mentioned earlier.

The updated plan includes handling edge cases. The initial state is set as (0, 0) representing no requests accepted and zero tables used. The final state represents the maximum amount of money earned by accepting or declining all requests. The function uses a dictionary to memoize the states.
