===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][0] = 0 for all i (base case: when there are no more money to spend), dp[0][j] = 0 for all j (base case: when there are no more tables)
dp[i][j] represents the maximum amount of money earned given i remaining tables and j total amount of money to spend.
The plan can be improved by considering the groups that have already been seated. 
For each group, calculate how much money they will earn if they are seated at each table, considering the available capacity of each table. 
If the group can be seated at a table with enough capacity and it would increase the total amount of money earned, then seat them at that table.
Memoization should be used to avoid calculating the same state values multiple times.
The plan seems correct but may require additional steps to handle edge cases such as when there are no more tables or no more money to spend.
