===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by defining a state that represents the maximum amount of money earned given the remaining tables and the total amount of money to spend.

dp[i][0] = 0 for all i (base case: when there are no more money to spend), dp[0][j] = 0 for all j (base case: when there are no more tables)

dp[i][j] represents the maximum amount of money earned given i remaining tables and j total amount of money to spend.

Design a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by iterating over the requests and updating the table values accordingly:

Let dp[i][j] be the maximum amount of money earned given i remaining tables and j total amount of money to spend.
For each request (size, spend):
    If the group can fit in any of the remaining tables:
        Update dp[i-1][j-spent] to max(dp[i-1][j-spent], dp[i-1][j-spent] + spent)
    Else:
        dp[i][j] = 0

Return dp[k][n]
