===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming: The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by defining a state that keeps track of the maximum amount of money earned for each group size, and the minimum number of tables required to accommodate all groups with sizes up to the current group size. Then, use tabulation or memoization to fill in the states in bottom-up manner.

The state expression is a tuple (accepted_requests, remaining_tables, max_earned) where accepted_requests is the number of accepted requests, remaining_tables is the number of tables left unused, and max_earned represents the maximum amount of money earned. The state can be initialized as (0, k, 0).

The transition relationship is that if we accept the current request, the new state will be (accepted_requests + 1, min(remaining_tables - ci, k), max_earned + pi) and if we decline the current request, the new state will be (accepted_requests, remaining_tables, max_earned). The choice of accepting or declining the request is based on whether the maximum amount of money earned increases.

Use a dictionary dp to store the maximum amount of money earned for each group size, where dp[i] represents the maximum amount of money earned with groups of size up to i. Initialize dp as {0: (0, k, 0)}.

The final answer will be the maximum value in the dp dictionary and the corresponding accepted requests and remaining tables can be obtained by tracing back from the maximum value.
