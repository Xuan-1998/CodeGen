===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by defining a state that represents the maximum amount of money earned given the remaining tables and the total amount of money to spend.

The base case would be when there are no more tables or no more money to spend, then return 0. Then, use memoization to fill in the states in top-down manner.

dp[i][j] represents the maximum amount of money earned with i tables remaining and j total amount to spend
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-ci*ri], dp[i][j-ci*ri]) for each request

Maintain a memo dictionary to store the results of subproblems, using a recursive function to calculate dp[i][j] and check if the result is already stored in memo.

The base case will be when i == 0 or j == 0, return 0.
For each table i from k-1 down to 0
    For each request ri and ci from requests
        If the group can fit at this table:
            Calculate dp[i][j] as the maximum of two options: 
                Accepting the request: dp[i-1][j-ci*ri]
                Declining the request: dp[i][j-ci*ri]
            Store the result in memo

Finally, return dp[0][n]
