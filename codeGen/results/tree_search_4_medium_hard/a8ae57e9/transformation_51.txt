===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming can solve this problem by defining a state that represents the maximum amount of money earned for each possible table configuration and total amount of money spent.

The base case would be when there are no more tables or no more money to spend, then return 0.

Then, use tabulation to fill in the states in bottom-up manner.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + pi * min(k, ci) for i in range(1, n+1), j in range(1, k+1)
where dp[i][j] represents the maximum amount of money earned with i requests and j tables available.

To optimize the computation, use a dictionary to store the state values and update them recursively using memoization.

The final answer would be the maximum value in the dp array, which corresponds to the maximum amount of money that can be earned.

This plan is correct. It correctly identifies the problem as a dynamic programming problem and proposes a bottom-up tabulation approach.

However, it does not specify how to determine which requests to accept and which to decline given the maximum amount of money earned. This information would need to be added to the plan.

Also, it does not consider edge cases such as when there are no tables available or no more money to spend.
