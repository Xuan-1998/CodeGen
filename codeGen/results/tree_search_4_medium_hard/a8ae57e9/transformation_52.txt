===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming can solve this problem by defining a state that represents the maximum amount of money earned for each possible table configuration and total amount of money spent. The base case would be when there are no more tables or no more money to spend, then return 0.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + pi * min(k, ci) for i in range(1, n+1), j in range(1, k+1)

Then, use tabulation to fill in the states in bottom-up manner.

Use a priority queue to efficiently select the requests that maximize the total amount of money earned.

After populating the dynamic programming table, iterate through the requests and for each request:

- If the size of the group is less than or equal to k, accept the request and update the maximum amount of money earned.
- Else, decline the request.

Finally, return the number of accepted requests and the total amount of money earned.

The plan includes edge cases as it considers all possible table configurations and total amounts of money spent. The priority queue ensures that the highest earning requests are selected first.
