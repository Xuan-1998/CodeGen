===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming: The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by defining a state that keeps track of the maximum amount of money earned for each group size, and the minimum number of tables required to accommodate all groups with sizes up to the current group size. Then, use tabulation or memoization to fill in the states in bottom-up manner.

The state expression is a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum amount of money earned by accepting the first i booking requests with group sizes less than or equal to j.

1. Initialize the dp table with zeros.
    - This will store the maximum amount of money earned for each group size and the minimum number of tables required.
2. Iterate over the booking requests:
    - For each request, iterate from k to 0 (k is the current group size):
        * If the current group size is less than or equal to j, update dp[i][j] based on whether to accept or decline the request.
3. Return the maximum amount of money earned and the minimum number of tables required.

This plan seems correct, but it can be improved by using memoization with a dictionary to store and reuse previously computed values.

One potential issue is that the current state does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, what if there are no booking requests? The dp table would remain zero, which may or may not be correct depending on the specific requirements of the problem.

Another potential issue is that the plan only considers accepting or declining each request individually without taking into account the constraints mentioned in the problem statement (ensuring that each group can be seated at a table with enough capacity).
