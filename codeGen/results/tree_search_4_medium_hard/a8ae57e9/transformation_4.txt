This solution should work correctly and efficiently within the given constraints. It iterates over each booking request, and for each request, it calculates the maximum amount of money that can be earned if we accept this request. The main challenge is handling a large number of requests without exceeding the constraints. This is achieved by using memoization to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computations.

The state expression used here represents the maximum amount of money earned by accepting the first i booking requests, which is more concise and easier to understand than the original 2D array representation.
