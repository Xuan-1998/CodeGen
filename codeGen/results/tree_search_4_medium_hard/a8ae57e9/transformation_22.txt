Dynamic programming: The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by defining two states: dp[i] representing the maximum amount of money earned for groups of size up to i, and t[k] representing the minimum number of tables required to accommodate all groups with sizes up to k.

A dictionary d = {(i, j): k} where (i, j) is the group size and k is the corresponding table number
let s[i] be the sum of money earned by groups of size i; then dp[i] = max(s[i]+dp[i-1], dp[i-1])
Use memoization by defining a dictionary dp = {0: 0} and fill it in bottom-up manner.
For each request, check if the group size is greater than any existing group size. If yes, update the maximum amount of money earned for groups of that size.

Initialize t[k] to k tables.
For each request, for each table from 1 to k, calculate the remaining capacity and the potential earnings. 
Choose the table with the highest potential earnings. Update the minimum number of tables required accordingly.

The plan can be improved by initializing dp[0] = 0 instead of assuming it will always be 0.
