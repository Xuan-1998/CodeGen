Dynamic programming can solve this problem by defining a state that represents the maximum amount of money earned for each possible table configuration and total amount of money spent. The base case would be when there are no more tables or no more money to spend, then return 0.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + pi * min(k, ci) for i in range(1, n+1), j in range(1, k+1)
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], (pi <= ri and ci <= k) ? pi : 0) for i in range(1, n+1), j in range(1, k+1)

Use a list of lists to store the states and use list comprehension to fill in the states in a single line.

state = [[0] * (k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]

for i in range(1, n+1):
    for j in range(1, k+1):
        state[i][j] = max(state[i-1][j], state[i][j-1]) + pi * min(k, ci)
        if pi <= ri and ci <= k:
            state[i][j] = max(state[i][j], pi)
