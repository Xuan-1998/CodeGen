===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by defining a state that represents the maximum amount of money earned given the remaining tables and the total amount of money to spend.

dp[i][j] is the maximum amount of money earned given the number of remaining tables and the total amount to spend, considering all possible requests.
State dp[i][j] represents the maximum money earned with i tables left and j total amount to spend. Transition relationship could be: 
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-ci*pi], 0) + pi, where pi is the size of the group and ci is the capacity of each table.
Use dictionary-based memoization with keys (i, j) and values representing the maximum amount of money earned.

To fill in the states in top-down manner, iterate through all possible requests and for each request, update dp[i][j] by considering whether to accept or decline the request. If the request is accepted, it will reduce the number of tables and the total amount of money to spend accordingly.
After filling up the dp table, the maximum amount of money earned can be obtained from the state dp[k][total_amount_to_spend], where k is the initial number of tables.

To output the accepted requests and the tables they occupy, iterate through all possible requests again and for each request, check if it's accepted. If accepted, update the state of the corresponding table and add the information to the output.
