===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming can solve this problem by defining a state that represents the maximum amount of money earned for each possible table configuration and total amount of money spent.

The base case would be when there are no more tables or no more money to spend, then return 0.

Then, use tabulation to fill in the states in bottom-up manner.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + pi * min(k, ci) for i in range(1, n+1), j in range(1, k+1)

Use a 2D array to store the state values and fill them in bottom-up manner using nested loops.

To improve this plan:

* Clarify what the base case should be. For example, when all tables are filled, or when there is no more money to spend.
* The dynamic programming equation seems correct, but it would be good to provide a detailed explanation of how the equation works and why it's correct.
* It would be helpful to specify how to use the 2D array to store and fill in the state values.

The plan does not include edge cases, such as what should happen if there are no more tables available or if all tables are filled before running out of money.
