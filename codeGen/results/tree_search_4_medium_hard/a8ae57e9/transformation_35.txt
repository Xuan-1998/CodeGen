===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by defining a state that represents the maximum amount of money earned given the remaining tables and the total amount of money to spend.

The base case would be when there are no more tables or no more money to spend, then return 0. Then, use memoization to fill in the states in top-down manner.

dp[i][j] is the maximum amount of money earned given the number of remaining tables and the total amount to spend, considering all possible requests

Define a state as dp[i][j] being the maximum money earned with i tables left and j total amount to spend. The transition relationship could be:
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-c*j], 0) + c*j
where c is the size of the group and j-c*j is the remaining amount to spend.

Fill in a 2D array dp with zeros and iterate over each state using two nested loops:
for i in range(k+1):
    for j in range(m+1):

For each state, check if the current request can be accepted (i.e., the group size is less than or equal to the number of remaining tables) and update the state accordingly.
