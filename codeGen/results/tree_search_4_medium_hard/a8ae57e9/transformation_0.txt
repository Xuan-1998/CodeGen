Dynamic programming: The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by defining a state that keeps track of the maximum amount of money earned for each group size and the minimum number of tables required to accommodate all groups with sizes up to the current group size. Then, use tabulation or memoization to fill in the states in bottom-up manner.

The state expression is a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum amount of money earned by accepting the first i booking requests with group sizes less than or equal to j.

Use top-down memoization to fill in the states, starting from the base cases and iteratively updating the states based on previously computed values. This can be achieved by defining a function that takes the current request as input and returns the maximum amount of money earned if the request is accepted, along with the minimum number of tables required.

The base case is when there are no more booking requests or no more available tables. The state update rule is to consider accepting the current request and not accepting it, and choose the option that results in a higher maximum amount of money earned.

To handle edge cases, ensure that the function handles the initial values correctly, i.e., dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, and dp[i][0] = 0 for all i. Also, consider whether there are any additional constraints or boundary conditions that need to be handled.

The plan includes edge cases: The base case when there are no more booking requests or no more available tables is included in the state update rule. Additionally, handling the initial values correctly (dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, and dp[i][0] = 0 for all i) ensures that the plan includes edge cases.
