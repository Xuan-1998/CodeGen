===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by defining a state that represents the maximum amount of money earned given the remaining tables and the total amount of money to spend.

dp[i][j] represents the maximum amount of money earned given i remaining tables and j total amount of money to spend.
- If there are no more tables or no more money to spend, return 0 (base case).
- For each request, consider two possibilities:
    - The current request can be seated at a table with enough capacity. In this case, consider dp[i-1][pi-c*s], where pi is the total amount of money to spend and ci is the size of the group.
    - The current request cannot be seated at a table with enough capacity. In this case, consider dp[i][j-ri].

Define a recursive function that takes the current state (i, j) as input, and returns the maximum amount of money earned given i remaining tables and j total amount of money to spend.
- Use memoization to store the results of subproblems.

dp[0][j] = 0 for all j (base case: when there are no more tables)
dp[i][0] = 0 for all i (base case: when there are no more money to spend)

The plan will iterate over each request and for each request, it will calculate the maximum amount of money that can be earned given the remaining tables and the total amount of money to spend. This value is then stored in dp[i][j]. Finally, return the maximum amount of money earned from all requests.
