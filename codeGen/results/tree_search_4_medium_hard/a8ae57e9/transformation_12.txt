===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming: The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by defining a state that keeps track of the maximum amount of money earned for each group size, and the minimum number of tables required to accommodate all groups with sizes up to the current group size. Then, use tabulation or memoization to fill in the states in bottom-up manner.

The state expression is a tuple (accepted_requests, remaining_tables), where accepted_requests is the number of accepted requests and remaining_tables is the number of tables left unused. The transition relationship is that if we accept the current request, the new state will be (accepted_requests + 1, max(0, remaining_tables - group_size)), and if we decline the current request, the new state will be (accepted_requests, remaining_tables).

Use a 3D table dp to store the maximum amount of money earned for each group size, where dp[i][j][k] represents the maximum amount of money earned with i accepted requests, j tables remaining, and k as the current group size. The base case is when there are no more requests or no more tables.

Fill in the table by considering all possible decisions: accept the current request or decline it. For each decision, update the state and calculate the maximum amount of money earned.

The final answer will be the maximum value in the dp table that corresponds to the last group size.
