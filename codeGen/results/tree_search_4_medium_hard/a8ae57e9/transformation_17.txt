===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming is indeed suitable for this problem.

The state expression can be represented as a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] is the maximum amount of money earned using at most j tables, considering only groups with size i or less.

The transition relationship can be defined as follows:

- If we accept the current request (size ci and money pi), the new state will be (i + ci * pi, min(j, k - 1)). This is because we are accepting a new group of size ci, so we need to update the total amount earned and possibly use an additional table.
- If we decline the current request, the new state will be (i, j). We are not changing the total amount earned or the number of tables used.

To fill in the dp table, we start by initializing dp[0][j] for 1 ≤ j ≤ k to be 0. This represents the maximum amount of money earned using at most j tables, considering only groups with size 0 (i.e., no groups).

Then, for each i from 1 to n and each j from 1 to k, we calculate dp[i][j] as the maximum of two possibilities:
    - Accepting the current request: dp[i-1][min(j, k - 1)] + pi
    - Declining the current request: dp[i-1][j]

We keep track of the maximum amount earned using at most j tables for groups with size i or less. This is stored in dp[n][k].

Finally, we find the optimal solution by iterating over the last row of the dp table and selecting the combination that maximizes the total amount earned while not exceeding k tables.

The plan includes edge cases: it correctly handles the case where n = 0 (no requests) and the case where k = 1 (only one table). For these edge cases, the optimal solution is to accept or decline all requests accordingly.
