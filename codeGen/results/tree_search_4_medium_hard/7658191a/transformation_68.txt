===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore an iterative dynamic programming solution by using a loop to fill in a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum score for i steps and j moves being made, with at most z moves being to the left. Initialize the base case when k = 0 as dp[0][j] = sum of all values in the array.
Consider the recursive relation: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-z][j+z]) + score[i] where j-1 and j+z are within valid bounds. This captures the idea that you can either make a move to the right (dp[i-1][j-1]) or to the left (dp[i-z][j+z]).
Implement memoization by creating a dictionary memo to store the computed values of subproblems, and use this dictionary to avoid recomputing the same value multiple times. Fill in the dp table using the recursive relation.
Return dp[k][0] as the maximum score that can be achieved after exactly k moves.
