===BEGIN PLAN===
Think of a bottom-up approach with tabulation by building up solutions to smaller subproblems and combining them to solve the original problem.

The base case would be when only one element is left, in which case the maximum score is just that single element.

Represent states as (i, score) pairs, where i is the current index and score is the maximum achievable score at that index, considering the allowed moves up to k steps. Initialize a 2D table with n rows and k+1 columns, where the value at row i and column j represents the maximum score that can be achieved after i moves and considering up to z moves to the left; use this table to store intermediate results and build up solutions to smaller subproblems.

For each cell (i, j), calculate the maximum score by considering two possibilities: 
  * Move to the right: update the score with the value at index i+1 and consider up to k-1 moves
  * Move to the left: update the score with the value at index i-1 and consider up to z moves
Choose the option that results in the maximum score.

Finally, return the value at cell (n-1, k) as the maximum achievable score.
