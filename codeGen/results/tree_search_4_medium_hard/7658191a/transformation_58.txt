===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore an iterative dynamic programming solution by using a loop to fill in a table or array, where each cell represents the maximum score for a corresponding subproblem.

Let dp[i][j] be the maximum score that can be achieved with i moves, considering j as the current index. 

Think about the maximum score that can be achieved by moving to the right or to the left from the current position, considering the constraints on the number of moves to the left.
The next state would depend on the direction of the move and the remaining moves allowed.

Create a 3D table where each cell dp[i][j][k] represents the maximum score that can be achieved with i moves, considering j as the current index, and k as the remaining moves allowed.

Initialize dp[0][j][k] to 0 for all j and k. This is because there are no moves left at this point.

Fill in the table row by row from bottom to top.
For each cell dp[i][j][k], consider the maximum score that can be achieved by moving to the right or to the left, considering the constraints on the number of moves to the left.

Calculate the maximum score for each possible move and update the corresponding cell in the table.

Return dp[n-1][0][z] as the maximum score that can be achieved.
