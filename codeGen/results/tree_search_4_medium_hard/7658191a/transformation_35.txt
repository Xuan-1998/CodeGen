===BEGIN PLAN===
Think of a bottom-up approach with tabulation by building up solutions to smaller subproblems and combining them to solve the original problem.

Formulate state and transition relationships by considering the maximum score that can be achieved with j moves, given the scores of the first i elements. Let dp[i][j] denote the maximum score that can be achieved using at most j moves after processing the first i elements.

Transition from dp[i-1][j-1] to dp[i][j] by considering two cases: 
1) Process the current element and move to the right.
2) Move to the left and process the previous element.

Update dp[i][j] based on these two cases, considering that we have at most z moves to the left.

Use memoization with a dictionary that maps (i, j) tuples to their corresponding maximum scores. This way, we can avoid recomputing the same subproblems multiple times and reduce the time complexity of our solution.

Implement the recursive function to compute dp[i][j] based on the transition rules and memoize it.
