===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore an iterative dynamic programming solution by using a loop to fill in a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum score that can be achieved after i moves and j is less than or equal to k.

The base case is when k = 0, where the maximum score is simply the sum of all values in the array. This is because we cannot perform any more moves once k reaches 0.

Create a 2D array dp with dimensions (n+1) x (k+1), where n is the length of the input array and k is the number of moves allowed. Initialize the first column of the array to be equal to the values in the input array, since we cannot perform any moves when k = 0.

The state also depends on whether the current move is to the right or to the left. If it's a move to the right, the score will increase by the value at index i+1. If it's a move to the left, the score will decrease by the value at index i-1. We can use this information to fill in the dp array.

For each cell dp[i][j], consider two options: moving to the right or moving to the left. The maximum score that can be achieved is the maximum of these two options.

To move to the right, we need to make sure that we do not exceed k moves and also do not perform more than z moves to the left in a row. If this is possible, then add the value at index i+1 to the score stored in dp[i-1][j-1] and update dp[i][j] accordingly.

To move to the left, we need to make sure that we do not exceed k moves and also do not perform more than z moves to the left in a row. If this is possible, then subtract the value at index i-1 from the score stored in dp[i+1][j-1] and update dp[i][j] accordingly.

Finally, return the maximum score that can be achieved after k moves, which is stored in dp[n][k].
