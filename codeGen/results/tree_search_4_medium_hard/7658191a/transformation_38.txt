Think of a bottom-up approach with tabulation by building up solutions to smaller subproblems and combining them to solve the original problem.

The base case would be when only one element is left, in which case the maximum score is just that single element.

Considering the current index i and move type (left/right), formulate states as (i, move_type) pairs, where move_type can be 0 for no move, 1 for a left move, and 2 for a right move. 

Memoize the maximum score for each state ((i, move_type)) to avoid redundant calculations and store them in a dictionary.

Let dp[(i, move_type)] represent the maximum score that can be achieved by making at most k moves from index i, with at most z consecutive left moves of type 1.

The recurrence relation would be:

- If (i, move_type) = (n, 0), then dp[(i, move_type)] = scores[i]
- If (i, move_type) = (n, 1) or (i, move_type) = (n, 2), then dp[(i, move_type)] = max(dp[(i - 1, 0)], dp[(i - 1, 1)])
- For other cases:

  * If move_type == 0:
    dp[(i, move_type)] = max(scores[i] + dp[(i + 1, 2)], scores[i] + dp[(i - 1, 1)])
  * If move_type == 1:
    if z > 0:
      dp[(i, move_type)] = dp[(i - 1, 1)]
    else:
      dp[(i, move_type)] = max(scores[i] + dp[(i + 1, 2)], scores[i] + dp[(i - 1, 1)])
  * If move_type == 2:
    if i < n and z > 0:
      dp[(i, move_type)] = dp[(i, 1)]
    else:
      dp[(i, move_type)] = max(scores[i] + dp[(i + 1, 2)], scores[i] + dp[(i - 1, 1)])

Initialize the dp dictionary with base cases and fill it up iteratively.

The final answer would be dp[(0, 0)], which represents the maximum score that can be achieved by making at most k moves from index 0.
