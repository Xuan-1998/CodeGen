===BEGIN PLAN===
Think of a bottom-up approach with tabulation by building up solutions to smaller subproblems and combining them to solve the original problem.

Let dp[i][j] be the maximum score that can be achieved after processing i elements and performing j moves. Initialize dp[0][0] as 0, since we start with no elements processed and no moves performed.

For each i from 1 to n and each j from 1 to k:
    If j is less than or equal to z, consider the possible cases where either the previous element or the next element is taken. Update dp[i][j] as the maximum score between these two possibilities.
    Otherwise, since we cannot make more than z moves to the left in a row, update dp[i][j] as the maximum score considering only the current element and the previous elements processed.

Implement memoization by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again. This can be achieved using a 2D array or a hashmap.

Finally, return dp[n][k] as the maximum score that can be achieved after processing all n elements and performing k moves.
