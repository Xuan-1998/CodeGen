===BEGIN PLAN===
Think of a bottom-up approach with tabulation by building up solutions to smaller subproblems and combining them to solve the original problem.

The base case would be when only one element is left, in which case the maximum score is just that single element

Define state transitions based on the allowed moves: if the current score is higher than the previous one, make a right move; otherwise, try to make a left move, but not more than z times in a row.

For memoization, use a dictionary where the key is a tuple of the current index and number of moves, and the value is the maximum score achieved so far. Use memoization to avoid recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.

Use dynamic programming by iterating over the array from left to right. Initialize the maximum score for each index as 0. Then iterate k times:

For each move, calculate the maximum score by considering two options:
    1. Move right: Calculate the maximum score including the current element and recursively call the function with the updated index and number of moves.
    2. Move left: If less than or equal to z moves were made in a row, try to move left. Calculate the maximum score excluding the current element and recursively call the function with the updated index and number of moves.

Store the calculated maximum score in the memoization dictionary for future reference.

Finally, return the maximum score at the end of the array.
