===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with tabulation by building up solutions to smaller subproblems and combining them to solve the original problem.

Think of a 2D DP table where each cell represents the maximum score that can be achieved after processing i elements, with j moves performed in total. Formulate a relation between adjacent cells in the table to capture the idea of moving either to the right or to the left. 

For example, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1] + arr[i]) where i is the number of elements processed, j is the total number of moves performed.

To improve this plan, it would be better to first sort the array in descending order because we want to choose the maximum score each time. 

Then apply the recurrence relation dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1] + arr[i]) in a bottom-up manner, starting from base cases where i=0 or j=0.

The base case would be when there is no element processed (i=0) or when there are no more moves left to perform (j=0).
