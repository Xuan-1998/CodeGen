===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming by defining a 2D table dp[i][j] as the maximum score that can be achieved by the end of the ith element if we have made j moves so far, with no more than z moves to the left in a row.
Define the base case: dp[0][0] = arr[0], since there are 0 moves and we start at index 1.
Fill up the table using the following transition relationship:
    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + arr[i], dp[i-1][j-1] - arr[i-1]) if j <= z
    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + arr[i] if j > z
Implement a recursive function to calculate the maximum score for each subproblem, and apply memoization using this 2D table.
Fill up the table row by row, starting from the base case.
Finally, return dp[n-1][k] as the maximum score that can be achieved in k moves.
