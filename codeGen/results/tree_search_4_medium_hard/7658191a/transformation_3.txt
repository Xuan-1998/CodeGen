===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming by defining a two-dimensional array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum score that can be achieved by the end of the ith element after j moves, considering that no more than z moves to the left are allowed in this process.

Define base cases: dp[1][0] = array[1], as there is only one move possible and it's either to the right or stay at the same position. Also, dp[i][k] for i > 1 can be calculated using information from previous moves (i.e., dp[i-1][j-1]).

For each subproblem, consider two possibilities: 
- Move to the left: Calculate the maximum score that can be achieved by moving one element to the left and then recursively calculate the maximum score for the remaining elements. This will involve considering the previously calculated scores (dp[i-1][j-1]).
- Move to the right: Calculate the maximum score that can be achieved by staying at the current position or moving one element to the right, and then recursively calculate the maximum score for the remaining elements.

Apply memoization to store and reuse the calculated values in a two-dimensional array dp.

Calculate the maximum score that can be achieved after k moves by iterating over the array from left to right and applying the above approach.
