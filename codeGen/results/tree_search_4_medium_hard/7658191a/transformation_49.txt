===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore an iterative dynamic programming solution by using a loop to fill in a table or array, where each cell represents the maximum score for a corresponding subproblem.

The maximum score for the first k moves is not necessarily the maximum score for the first k-1 moves plus the value at index k. Instead, we should consider all possible transitions (either moving right or left within z moves) and take the maximum score among them.

Defining a state as the cumulative sum of the array up to index i, and transitions as either adding the value at index i+1 to the state or subtracting the value at index i-z from the state if it's within z moves ago (to account for moving left).

Using a 2D table where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum score for the first j moves with a cumulative sum up to index i. The base case should be when j=0, in which case the maximum score is 0.

To improve the plan, we can add an extra layer of optimization by only considering transitions that are within z moves ago (i.e., i-z <= k).

Potential issues with the plan include handling edge cases such as when k=1 or z=0. We should also consider whether there's a need to handle non-integer values in the input array.

Does it include edge cases? Yes, the updated plan considers edge cases such as when k=1 and when z=0.
