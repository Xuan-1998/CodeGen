===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming by defining a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum score that can be achieved after i moves and j left moves.

The base case would be when i or j reaches zero. In this case, the maximum score is simply the sum of the elements in the array up to index i.

For the recursive case, consider two possibilities: either make a move to the right or make a move to the left.

If we choose to make a move to the right, we can add the value at index i+1 to the current maximum score and continue with dp[i+1][j] moves remaining. If we choose to make a move to the left, we can add the value at index i-1 to the current maximum score and continue with dp[i-1][z] moves remaining.

We can use memoization to store the maximum scores for each subproblem and calculate them in a bottom-up manner.

The final answer would be dp[n][k].

This plan takes into account all possible edge cases, including when i or j reaches zero.
