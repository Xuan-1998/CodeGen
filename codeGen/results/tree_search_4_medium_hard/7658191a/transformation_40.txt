===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with tabulation by building up solutions to smaller subproblems and combining them to solve the original problem.

The base case would be when only one element is left, in which case the maximum score is just that single element.

Define state transitions based on the allowed moves: if the current score is higher than the previous one, make a right move; otherwise, try to make a left move, but not more than z times in a row.

Use a 2D array with dimensions (n+1, k+1) to store the maximum score at each step and number of moves. The value at position (i, j) represents the maximum score that can be achieved after processing i elements and making j moves.

For each cell in the 2D array:
    Initialize it as the sum of the scores up to index i.
    For each move from 0 to k:
        If there are enough moves left (j < k), consider both right and left moves, 
            updating the maximum score if a better score can be achieved.
        Update the cell with the maximum score that can be achieved after processing i elements and making j moves.

Return the value at position (n, k) as the maximum score that can be achieved.
