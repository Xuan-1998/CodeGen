===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore an iterative dynamic programming solution by using a loop to fill in a table or array, where each cell represents the maximum score for a corresponding subproblem.

Let the maximum score for a subproblem ending at index i be the maximum score that can be achieved with i moves, and let the maximum score that can be achieved with i+1 or more moves be the maximum score for the same problem ending at index j.

Consider each cell of the table as a tuple (i, j), where i is the current position and j is the number of moves left. This can help in defining the state and transition relationships.

Use memoization by storing the intermediate results in a dictionary, where the key is the state of the problem (i, j) and the value is the corresponding maximum score.

Consider using a 2D table to store the dynamic programming states and transitions.
