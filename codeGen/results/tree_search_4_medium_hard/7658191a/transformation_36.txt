===BEGIN PLAN===
Think of a bottom-up approach with tabulation by building up solutions to smaller subproblems and combining them to solve the original problem.

Consider two variables: dp[i][j] represents the maximum score that can be achieved by processing the first i elements, given j moves performed so far. The variable dp[i][j] is only dependent on the values of dp[i-1][k] where k is in the range [0, min(j+1, z)].

Formulate state and transition relationships: 
- Initialize dp[0][0] to 0, since no elements have been processed yet.
- For each i from 1 to n:
    - Initialize dp[i][0] to a[i], since no moves are performed yet.
    - For each j from 1 to min(k+1, z):
        - Compute the maximum score for processing the first i-1 elements and performing j-1 moves. This is represented by dp[i-1][j-1].
        - If j is less than or equal to z, consider the possibility of making one move to the left from the current position.
        - Update dp[i][j] as the maximum between these two values.

Use a single array to tabulate the dynamic programming solution: 
- Initialize an array dp[n][min(k+1, z)] with all elements set to 0 initially.
- Fill in the state and transition relationships for each i and j.
