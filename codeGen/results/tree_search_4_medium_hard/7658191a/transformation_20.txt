===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the maximum score achieved after processing i elements, with j moves performed in total (0 <= j <= k), where j <= z if i < n - 1.

Let dp[i][j] be the maximum score achievable after processing i elements and performing j moves. We can formulate a relation between the current maximum score and the maximum scores of previous states as follows:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][min(j, z)] + arr[i])

This is because we have two options: either process the next element and perform j moves in total (if i < n - 1), or skip processing the next element and perform min(j, z) moves.

Use dynamic programming by iterating over the array from left to right and keeping track of the maximum scores for each subproblem. Initialize dp[0][0] to 0, as there is no score initially.

Iterate over the array from left to right, considering only the previous state when calculating the current maximum score:

for i in range(1, n):
    for j in range(min(k, i - 1) + 1):
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][min(j, z)] + arr[i])

Finally, return the maximum score achievable after processing all elements and performing k moves:

return dp[n-1][k]
