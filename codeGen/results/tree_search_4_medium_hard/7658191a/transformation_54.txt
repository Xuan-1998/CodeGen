===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore an iterative dynamic programming solution by using a loop to fill in a table or array, where each cell represents the maximum score for a corresponding subproblem.

Initialize the DP table with zeros and calculate the base case (k = 0).

The maximum score for the first k moves is the maximum score for the first k-1 moves plus the value at index k if it's not more than z moves away. Otherwise, consider transitions as adding the value of the previous element.

Tabulation using a loop to update the dynamic programming array:
    Initialize current_max and previous_max
    For each move (k from 0 to k):
        If k is less than or equal to z, update current_max with the maximum of current_max and previous_max + score[i+k]
        Update previous_max = current_max
    Return current_max
