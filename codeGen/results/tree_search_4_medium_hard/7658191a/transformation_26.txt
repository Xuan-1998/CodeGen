===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with tabulation by building up solutions to smaller subproblems and combining them to solve the original problem.

Consider the maximum score achieved after processing i elements, with j moves performed in total (0 <= j <= k), where j <= z if i < n - 1. Define a 2D table dp of size n x (k + 1) to store the maximum scores for each subproblem.

Formulate a relation between the current maximum score and the maximum scores of previous states based on whether to move left or right. For example, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + arr[i], dp[i-1][j] - arr[i]), where i is the number of elements processed, j is the total number of moves performed.

Use memoization by defining a function to calculate the maximum score for each subproblem and storing the results in a dictionary to avoid redundant computation. This can be achieved using dynamic programming with memoization.
