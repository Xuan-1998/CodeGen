===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore an iterative dynamic programming solution by using a loop to fill in a table or array, where each cell represents the maximum score for a corresponding subproblem.

Initialize a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum score for i moves and j is less than or equal to k.
The base case would be when i = 0, dp[i][j] should be initialized as 0 because there are no moves yet.
When i > 0, consider all possible transitions from state (i-1, max_score) where max_score represents the maximum score for i-1 moves.

For each transition, calculate the new maximum score by adding the value at index k and considering if it's less than z moves ago. 
Update dp[i][j] as the maximum of these new maximum scores.

The final answer would be the maximum score for k moves, which is stored in dp[k][0].
