===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore an iterative dynamic programming solution by using a loop to fill in a table or array, where each cell represents the maximum score for a corresponding subproblem.

Define a state as the cumulative sum of the array up to index i. Transitions can be either adding the value at index i+1 to the state or subtracting the value at index i-z if it's within z moves ago.

Define a function dp[i][j] that calculates the maximum score for the first j moves with a cumulative sum up to index i and implement memoization using a dictionary.

For each cell in the table, calculate the maximum score by considering all possible transitions. If j < k, consider adding the value at index i+1; if j >= k, do not consider this transition as we have reached the k-th move.

To handle edge cases, initialize dp[0][j] for 0 <= j <= k to be the cumulative sum of the array up to index i. For i > 0, set dp[i][k] to be the maximum score achieved in the first k moves with a cumulative sum up to index i.
