===BEGIN PLAN===
Think of a bottom-up approach with tabulation by building up solutions to smaller subproblems and combining them to solve the original problem.

Consider the maximum score that can be achieved by processing i elements (1 ≤ i ≤ n) with j moves performed (0 ≤ j ≤ k).

Let memo[i][j] represent the maximum score that can be achieved by processing i elements with j moves. 

Initialize a 2D array dp of size n × k to store the memoized values.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + arr[i-1], dp[i-1][j] + (i > 1 ? arr[i-2] : 0)) if j <= z, else dp[i-1][j]

The base case for the recurrence is when i = 0 or j = 0. In this case, the maximum score that can be achieved is 0.

Compute the maximum score by iterating over all elements and moves: max(dp[n][k], dp[n-1][k-1] + arr[n-1])
