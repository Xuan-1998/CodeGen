===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach with two nested loops, where the outer loop represents the indices of the array and the inner loop represents the number of moves made so far.

Define dp[i][j] as the maximum score that can be achieved by making j moves from the start to the i-th index. The base case would be when i or j reaches zero.

The recurrence relation could be:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + arr[i-1], dp[i-1][j] + arr[i]) if i > 0 and j <= k

This is because we have two options: either move to the left (i-1) and make j-1 moves, or stay at the current index and make j moves.

Apply memoization to avoid redundant calculations by storing previously computed values in a dp table.

The final answer would be dp[n][k].
