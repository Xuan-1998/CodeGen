===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore an iterative dynamic programming solution by using a loop to fill in a 2D array dp where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum score for the first j moves with a cumulative sum up to index i.
Initialize dp[0][0] as 0, and dp[i][0] as the value at index i for all i from 1 to n.
For each j from 1 to k:
    For each i from j to n:
        Calculate two possible scores: adding the value at index i+1 (if it's within z moves ago) or subtracting the value at index i-z if it exists.
        Update dp[i][j] as the maximum of these two scores plus the cumulative sum up to index i.
Return dp[n][k].
