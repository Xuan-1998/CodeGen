===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore an iterative dynamic programming solution by using a loop to fill in a table or array, where each cell represents the maximum score for a corresponding subproblem.

Let dp[i] be the maximum score that can be achieved with i moves. Initialize dp[0] as 0, since there's no way to achieve any score with 0 moves.

For each index i from 1 to n-1:
    Calculate the maximum score that can be achieved by moving to the right or to the left from the current position.
        If i <= k, calculate the maximum score that can be achieved by moving to the left and subtracting z from it. This is because we have at most k moves to the left, and we can't make more than z moves in a row.
        If i > k, just consider moving to the right without any constraints.

    Update dp[i] as the maximum score that can be achieved by either moving to the right or to the left from the current position.

Use memoization by storing the intermediate results of subproblems in a dictionary and look up the values instead of recalculating them.

Finally, return dp[n-1] as the maximum score that can be achieved with n-1 moves.
