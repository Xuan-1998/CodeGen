===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming by defining a 2D array dp as follows:
dp[i][j] represents the maximum score that can be achieved by the end of the ith element after j moves, considering that no more than z moves to the left are allowed in this process.

Initially set all values of dp to negative infinity. Then fill up the dp array using the following recurrence relation:

For each i from 1 to n and for each j from 0 to k:
    If j == 0, then dp[i][j] is equal to the value at index i.
    Otherwise, consider two cases: either make a move to the right (score += arr[i+1]) or make a move to the left (score += arr[i-1]).
        For each of these two cases:
            If this is not the first move and we have made no more than z moves to the left in a row, then consider making another move to the left.
                dp[i][j] is equal to the maximum score between these two cases.

Finally, return dp[n][k].
