===BEGIN PLAN===
Think of a bottom-up approach with tabulation by building up solutions to smaller subproblems and combining them to solve the original problem.
The base case would be when only one element is left, in which case the maximum score is just that single element
Represent states as (i, score) pairs, where i is the current index and score is the maximum achievable score at that index, considering the allowed moves up to k steps.

Create a list of tuples (i, score) representing the maximum achievable scores at each index, sorted by increasing index; use dynamic programming to fill in the list in bottom-up manner.
For each state (i, score), consider all possible moves: moving to the right (score + array[i+1]) and moving to the left (score + array[i-1])
For each move, check if it's within the allowed k steps and if there haven't been more than z consecutive moves to the left
If the move is valid, update the score at state (i, score) with the maximum achievable score considering this move

Let dp[i] be the maximum achievable score at index i. The final answer will be dp[n]
Initialize dp[0] = array[0], since there's no previous element to consider for the first index
Iterate over indices 1 to n-1, and for each i:
    - If there haven't been more than z consecutive moves to the left, update dp[i] with max(dp[i-1] + array[i-1], dp[i+1] + array[i+1])
    - If there have been more than z consecutive moves to the left, update dp[i] with dp[i-z]

Return dp[n]
