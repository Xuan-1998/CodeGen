===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with memoization by defining a recursive function that calculates the maximum score for each subproblem, then apply memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Define dp[i][j] as the maximum score that can be achieved by the end of the ith element after j moves, considering that no more than z moves to the left are allowed in this process.

Define a tuple state as (i, j) where i is the current index and j is the number of moves left. The last_move variable is not necessary since we only need to consider the current index and number of moves left for each subproblem.

Define a memoization dictionary where the keys are tuples representing the state (i, j) and the values are the calculated maximum scores for each subproblem.

Consider initializing dp[i][j] as -1 if it's impossible to achieve the score by the end of the ith element after j moves. This way we can handle edge cases correctly.
