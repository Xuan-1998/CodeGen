===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach with memoization by defining a recursive function that calculates the maximum score for each subproblem, then apply memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Define dp[i][j] as the maximum score that can be achieved by the end of the ith element if we have made j moves so far. The base case would be when i equals n or j equals 0.

 Define two variables, left and right, which store the maximum scores for the cases where the last move was to the left and the right respectively.

The transition relationship involves calculating the scores for these two cases: one where the last move was to the left (left = dp[i-1][j-1] + a[i-1]) and the other where it was to the right (right = dp[i+1][j-1] + a[i]). Then, choose the maximum between left and right.

 Define dp[i][j] as the maximum score that can be achieved by the end of the ith element if we have made j moves so far. Apply memoization to avoid redundant calculations in a top-down approach. Use a dictionary or a hashmap to store and retrieve the calculated values efficiently.

For each move, check if it's within the allowed limit (j <= z). If not, reset the move count to 0 and continue with the next iteration.

The final answer would be dp[n][k].
