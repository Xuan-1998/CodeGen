===BEGIN PLAN===
Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

Consider the state as a tuple containing the current ticket index and the total count of each possible number. dp[(i, k)] represents the probability of correct numbering up to i-th ticket with k instances of each possible number.
dp[(i, (count1, count2))] represents the total count of first and second numbers up to i-th ticket.

To implement dynamic programming using a 3D array to store the probabilities for each ticket and the counts of each number. The dp state should include the current ticket index, the count of each possible number, and the previous correct numbering probability.
dp[(i, (count1, count2), prev_prob)] represents the transition relationship: dp[i-1] * P_i * (1 / C(i)), where C(i) is the total number of ways to distribute i tickets.

The base case should be when there's only one ticket left. In this case, return the probability that the remaining ticket has distinct numbers.
dp[(n-1, (count1, count2), prev_prob)] = P(n-1) * (1 / 2).

To calculate the probability of correct numbering for the current ticket, consider all possible ways to distribute the i tickets. Then multiply this by the probability that the remaining tickets have distinct numbers and the total number of ways to distribute these tickets.
dp[(i, (count1, count2), prev_prob)] = sum(dp[j] * P(j) * (1 / C(i-j)) for j in range(i))

To avoid edge cases, consider initializing the dp array with a value that represents the probability of correct numbering when there's only one ticket left.
dp[0] = 1.

The time complexity should be O(n), where n is the number of tickets. This is because each ticket contributes to the total probability.
The space complexity should be O(1) because we're using a constant amount of space for memoization.
