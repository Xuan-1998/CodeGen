Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

Consider the state as a tuple containing the current ticket index and the total count of each possible number, dp[(i, k)] represents the probability of correct numbering up to i-th ticket with k instances of each possible number.

Initially, set dp[(0, 0, 0)] = 1, since there is only one way to correctly number a single ticket (all numbers are distinct).

Iterate over all possible states (i.e., ticket indices and counts of each number) as follows:
    - For the first ticket (i = 0):
        + If count1 = 1 and count2 = 0, dp[(i, count1, count2)] = P1 * (1 - P1/16)^(n-1), where P1 is the probability of the first number on this ticket. This represents the case where the first number appears only once.
        + If count1 = 0 and count2 = 1, dp[(i, count1, count2)] = (1 - P1/16) * P2 * (1 - P2/16)^(n-1), where P2 is the probability of the second number on this ticket. This represents the case where the second number appears only once.
    - For subsequent tickets (i > 0):
        + If count1 = i and count2 = 0, dp[(i, count1, count2)] = dp[(i-1, i-1, 0)] * P1 * (1 - P1/16)^(n-i), representing the case where the first number appears i times.
        + If count1 = 0 and count2 = i, dp[(i, count1, count2)] = dp[(i-1, 0, i-1)] * (1 - P1/16) * P2 * (1 - P2/16)^(n-i), representing the case where the second number appears i times.
    - For each state, update the probability accordingly:
        + If count1 = count2 and both counts are less than n, dp[(i, count1, count2)] should be 0, since all tickets have distinct numbers.

Return the value of dp[(n, _, _)], which represents the overall probability of correct numbering for the given set of tickets.
