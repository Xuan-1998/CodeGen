Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

The base case is when we have processed all tickets (i.e., i=n), in which case the probability of correct numbering is 1 if all numbers are distinct, and 0 otherwise. This is because we have already selected a unique number for each ticket, ensuring that all numbers are distinct.

The state is a binary vector representing whether each number has been used so far, with the transition relationship being the probability of correct numbering given the current ticket's numbers and the used numbers. 

Let dp[i][state] be the probability of correct numbering after processing i tickets, where state represents the used numbers. The dynamic programming equation can be written as:

dp[i][state] = (P1 * (1 - state[0]) + P2 * (1 - state[1])) * dp[i-1][next_state]

where next_state is the binary vector obtained by updating state according to whether the current ticket's numbers are used.

The transition relationship considers two cases: if neither number has been used, or if one of the numbers has been used. The probability of correct numbering in each case is calculated as the product of the probability that the current ticket is correctly numbered and the probability that all previous tickets were correctly numbered.

To avoid redundant calculations, we can use memoization to store the intermediate results in a 2D array dp[][].

The final answer will be the result of calculating dp[n][state] for the initial state where all numbers are initially unused.
