===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

**State:** The set of unique numbers seen so far (distinct numbers).
**Transition:** Add a new number to the set if it's not already there. If it is, just add the probabilities together.

**Base Case:** When all tickets have been processed (i.e., len(state) == n), in which case the probability is the product of the probabilities of the distinct numbers.

**Dynamic Programming:** Use a dictionary to store the probabilities and look them up as needed. Initialize the dictionary with base cases for the empty set and sets of sizes 1 to n-1.

**Edge Cases:**

* When n = 0, return 1 (there are no tickets, so the probability is 1).
* When P_i = 0 or A_i = B_i, return 0 (if there's a zero probability or the numbers are the same, there's no chance of correct numbering).
