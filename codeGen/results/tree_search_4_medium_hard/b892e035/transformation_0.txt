===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The state could be (n, p1, p2) where n is the current ticket number and p1, p2 are the probabilities of the first and second numbers respectively. This state captures all relevant information about the current ticket and the previously drawn tickets.

Transitions: For each new ticket, we calculate the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets by considering all possible combinations of numbers for the current ticket. The transition function would take the current state (n, p1, p2) and return a list of probabilities corresponding to each possible combination of numbers for the current ticket.

Base Case: The base case is when we have drawn all n tickets. In this case, the probability of correct numbering is simply the product of the probabilities of distinct numbers for each ticket.

Dynamic Programming Algorithm:
1. Create an array dp of size 2^(n+1) × (n+1) to store the dynamic programming table.
2. Initialize the base case: dp[0][i] = 1 for all i, since drawing no tickets always results in a probability of 1.
3. Fill up the dynamic programming table:
   - For each ticket i from 1 to n:
     - For each possible combination mask of numbers drawn so far (0 ≤ mask < 2^(n+1)):
       - Calculate the probabilities p1, p2 for the current ticket given the previous tickets and the mask.
       - Update dp[mask][i] with the product of the probability of distinct numbers for the current ticket and the previously computed probability dp[mask][i-1].
4. Return dp[2^(n+1)-1][n] as the final answer.
