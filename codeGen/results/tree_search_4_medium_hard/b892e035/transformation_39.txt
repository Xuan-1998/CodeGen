===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probabilities of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

The base case would be when all tickets have been processed (i.e., len(state) == n), in which case the probability is the product of the probabilities of the distinct numbers.

State: The probability of correct numbering given the previous tickets.
Transition: Update the probability based on the new ticket's numbers and probabilities.

Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming values, with dimensions (n+1) x (2^16 + 1), where each cell dp[i][j] represents the probability of correct numbering given i tickets and j unique numbers.

Transition function: For each new ticket, calculate the new number of unique numbers by updating j based on the probabilities P0 and P1. Then update the state with the product of the probabilities (P0 * (1 - P0) + P1 * (1 - P1)).

The final answer is the sum of all the probabilities in the last row of the dp array, divided by 2^n to normalize it.
