===BEGIN PLAN===
Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

The base case is when we have processed all tickets (i.e., i=n), in which case the probability of correct numbering is 1 if all numbers are distinct, and 0 otherwise.

Let the state be a tuple (i, seen) where i is the current ticket index and seen is a set of unique numbers seen so far. The probability at this state is then calculated based on the probabilities of the two possible numbers for the current ticket. If both numbers are unseen, add them to seen and recursively calculate the probability for the next ticket. If one or both numbers are seen before, directly return 1 or 0 depending on whether they are distinct.

Apply bottom-up approach by initializing a memoization table dp with size n+1 where dp[i] is the probability of correct numbering after processing i tickets. Initialize dp[0] to 1. Then, for each ticket from 1 to n, calculate the state probability based on the seen numbers and probabilities, and update dp[i] accordingly.

Apply both top-down and bottom-up approaches by initializing a memoization table dp with size n+1 where dp[i] is the probability of correct numbering after processing i tickets. Initialize dp[0] to 1. Then, for each ticket from 1 to n, calculate the state probability based on the seen numbers and probabilities, and update dp[i] accordingly.

The final answer is dp[n].
