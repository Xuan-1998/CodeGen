===BEGIN PLAN===
Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

Let the state be the current ticket index and the previous number assigned to a ticket. dp[i][j] represents the probability of correct numbering up to i-th ticket with j as the last assigned number.
Let's consider two possible cases:
- The (i-1)-th ticket has the same number as the j-th ticket: In this case, we can't assign the j-th number to the i-th ticket. So, the probability remains unchanged from the previous state dp[i-1][j].
- The (i-1)-th ticket has a different number than the j-th ticket: In this case, there are two possible ways to correctly number the i-th ticket:
  - Assign the first number of the i-th ticket. This happens with probability P_i \* (1 - p) where p is the probability that the i-th ticket was numbered with the second number and not the first.
  - Assign the second number of the i-th ticket. This happens with probability P_i \* p.

So, dp[i][j] = (1-p) \* dp[i-1][0] + p \* dp[i-1][1]

The base case is when i = 1 and j = 0 or 1. In this case, we simply assign the first number with probability P_1 and the second number with probability 1 - P_1.

The plan can be improved by using bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation instead of memoization for top-down approach. This is because in a bottom-up approach, we fill up the table from the base case to the final state whereas in a top-down approach, we start filling from the top and then move down.

There are no potential issues with the plan as it correctly takes into account all possible cases of correct numbering for each ticket.
The edge cases include n = 1 (where there is only one ticket) and P_i = 0 or 1 (where a particular number has zero or one probability).
