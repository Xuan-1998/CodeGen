===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probabilities of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

The base case would be when all tickets have been processed (i.e., len(state) == n), in which case the probability is the product of the probabilities of the distinct numbers.

State: The set of unique numbers seen so far, Transition: Add a new number to the set

Create a 2D table where each cell (i, j) represents the probability of getting j distinct numbers given i tickets. For each cell (i, j), calculate the maximum probability by considering all possible cases:

- If the current ticket has a unique number that hasn't been seen before, add it to the set and move on to the next ticket.
- If the current ticket has a repeated number, there's no change in the set of distinct numbers.

The recurrence relation would be: dp[i][j] = (P * dp[i-1][k]) + ((1-P) * sum(dp[i-1][m] for m in range(k+1)))

Initialize the table with base cases:

- For i=0, dp[0][0] = 1 (base case for empty set)
- For j>0, dp[0][j] = 0 (base case for no tickets)
