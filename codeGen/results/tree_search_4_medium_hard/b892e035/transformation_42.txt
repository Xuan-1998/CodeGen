===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

Let's define a state as the set of possible correct numberings that have been seen so far. The base case would be when all tickets have been processed (i.e., len(state) == n), in which case the probability is the product of the probabilities of the distinct numbers.

The transition function would update the state when a new ticket is processed. This can be done by considering the two possible numbers on the current ticket and updating the state accordingly.

To fill up the 2D table, we need to iterate over each possible number for the first and second tickets. For each combination of numbers, calculate the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets (state). Update the transition function with this probability. The base case would be when all tickets have been processed, in which case the probability is the product of the probabilities of the distinct numbers.

The 2D table will contain the probability of correct numbering for each possible combination of numbers on the first and second tickets given the previous tickets (state).

To fill up the table, iterate over each cell from top to bottom and left to right. For each cell, calculate the probability by considering all possible combinations of numbers that could lead to this state.

The updated version of the plan is as follows:
