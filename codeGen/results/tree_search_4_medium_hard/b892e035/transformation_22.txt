===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probabilities of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

The base case would be when there's only one possible combination left (i.e., 1), in which case the probability is that single combination's value.

Let dp[i] be the probability of having i unique numbers so far. 

Transition: For each new ticket, calculate the probability of this ticket being numbered correctly given the current unique numbers. This probability is calculated as the product of the probabilities of each number not being repeated and the number not being previously seen. 

dp[i+1] = sum(dp[j]*probability(ticket is correct given j unique numbers) for all 0 <= j < i)

The total probability is dp[n]

This plan does not consider edge cases, it assumes that n is always less than or equal to 50 and the probabilities are always less than or equal to 100. This needs to be checked before running the code.
