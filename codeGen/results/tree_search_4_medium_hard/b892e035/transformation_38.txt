===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The set of unique numbers seen so far
Transition: Add a new number to the set

Design a recursive function that keeps track of the subproblems solved using memoization. For each ticket, calculate the probability of correct numbering based on the state and transition.

Base case: When all tickets have been processed (i.e., len(state) == n), in which case the probability is the product of the probabilities of the distinct numbers.

Memoize the recursive function to avoid recalculating subproblems. This will significantly improve the time complexity.

Edge cases:
- If there are no tickets, return 1 (100% chance of correct numbering)
- If all tickets have the same number, return 0 (0% chance of correct numbering)

The plan is correct in its approach but might need slight adjustments to handle edge cases and optimize memoization.
