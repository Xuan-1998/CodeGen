The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.
Let's define dp[i] as the probability of correct numbering for tickets 1...i.
The base case would be when there's only one possible combination left (i.e., i==n), in which case the probability is that single combination's value, P[n].
For other cases, we need to consider all combinations of numbers for the current ticket and calculate their probabilities. Let's call this set S.
Then, for each number in S, calculate the probability of correct numbering if this number is chosen, which can be done by multiplying the current probability with the probability of the previous tickets (dp[i-1]) and the probability of choosing this specific number (P_i).
Add up all these probabilities to get the total probability for the current ticket.
The transition function would be: dp[i] = sum((p * dp[i-1] for p in S))
Tabulate the solution by creating a table where each entry represents the probability of correct numbering for tickets 1...i.
