Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

Consider the state as a tuple containing the current ticket index and the total count of each possible number. dp[(i, k)] represents the probability of correct numbering up to i-th ticket with k instances of each possible number.

dp[(i, (count1, count2))] represents the total count of first and second numbers up to i-th ticket. The transition relationship is dp[i-1] * P_i, where P_i is the probability of the current ticket being numbered with a particular number.

To use a dictionary to memoize the results of subproblems as you recursively calculate the probability of correct numbering.

Consider base cases: when i equals 0, there are no tickets, so the probability of correct numbering is 1. When i equals n and count1 equals 0 or count2 equals 0, it means all tickets have been numbered with one particular number, so the probability of correct numbering is 0.

To avoid counting the same subproblem multiple times, use memoization to store the results of subproblems as you recursively calculate the probability of correct numbering. This can be done using a dictionary where the key is the state (i, count1, count2) and the value is the calculated probability.

Finally, return dp[(n, (0, 0))] as the overall probability of correct numbering.
