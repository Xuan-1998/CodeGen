===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

The base case would be when all tickets have been processed (i.e., i == n), in which case the probability is either 1 if all numbers are distinct or 0 if not.

We can create a memoization table dp where dp[i][s] represents the probability that the first i tickets have unique numbers given that the set of unique numbers seen so far is s. The transition relationship would be updating this set with the new numbers from each ticket, and considering the two possible outcomes (either the number appears in the set or not).

For a given state s and i-th ticket, we can calculate dp[i][s] as follows:
- If the first number of the i-th ticket is already in the set s, then the probability of distinct numbers decreases to 0.
- Otherwise, it remains unchanged (i.e., dp[i][s] = dp[i-1][s \cup {first_number}]).

The final answer would be the sum of probabilities over all possible sets of unique numbers seen so far. We can optimize this by only considering the sets that include at least one number from each ticket, since a set with fewer numbers has a lower probability.
