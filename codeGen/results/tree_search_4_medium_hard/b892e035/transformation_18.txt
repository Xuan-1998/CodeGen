===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The state could be the total number of possible unique number combinations and the transition relationship would involve calculating the new possible combinations given the current ticket's options. Define the state as a pair (a, b), where a and b are the counts of distinct numbers that have been correctly numbered so far for the first and second numbers, respectively.

State transitions:
- If the current ticket's first number is distinct from previously chosen numbers, increment count a.
- If the current ticket's second number is distinct from previously chosen numbers, increment count b.
- For each possible combination of the current ticket's options, calculate the probability by multiplying the probabilities of the two numbers being correct.

Utilize tabulation by initializing a 2D array dp[n+1][16+1] and filling it up based on the given probabilities. Start from base cases where n = 0 (no tickets), then fill up the table iteratively.
- For each ticket, calculate the new possible combinations of distinct numbers for the first and second numbers and update the state.
- Use these updated states to fill in the dp table.

The final answer is the sum of probabilities of all correct numberings, which is stored in the bottom-right corner of the dp table. Round this value to ignore rounding errors less than 10^-6.
