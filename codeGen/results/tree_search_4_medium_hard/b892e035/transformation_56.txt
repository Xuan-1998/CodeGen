Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

Let dp[i][j] represent the probability that there are i distinct numbers and j tickets remaining. The state transition relationship would be:

* If the current ticket's number is new (i.e., not seen before), update dp[i+1][j-1] as the sum of:
	+ The probability that the current ticket's first number is correct, times the updated probability
	+ The probability that the current ticket's second number is correct, times the updated probability

* If the current ticket's number is not new (i.e., already seen before), update dp[i][j-1] as the sum of:
	+ The probability that the current ticket's first number is correct, times the updated probability
	+ The probability that the current ticket's second number is correct, times the updated probability

Base case: dp[0][n] represents the initial state with no distinct numbers and n tickets remaining. This should be initialized to 1.
