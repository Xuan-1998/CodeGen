===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The state could be the total number of possible unique number combinations. However, this is not enough to capture the probability correctly. Instead, consider using an array dp where dp[i][j] represents the probability that the first i tickets are numbered correctly given that the last ticket's correct number is j.

Transition relationship: For each ticket, there are two options for its correct number (A_i or B_i), and we update the dp table accordingly. If the last ticket's correct number is A_i, then the next ticket can have either A_i or B_i as its correct number; similarly if it's B_i.

Implementing a dynamic programming table where each row represents a given number of tickets, with each cell storing the probability of correct numbering for that many tickets. 

State transitions: dp[i][j] = (P_i*A_i + (1-P_i)*B_i) * dp[i-1][k], where k is 0 if A_i and B_i are both distinct from j, 1 if one of them is equal to j, or 2 if they are both equal to j. 

The base case is when i = 1, in which case the probability of correct numbering for a single ticket is simply P_1.

Finally, return dp[n-1][0], since we're interested in the probability that the first n tickets are numbered correctly, and the last ticket's correct number doesn't matter.
