===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The state could be a list where the elements are the probabilities of the used numbers and the transition relationship would involve updating the probabilities based on the current ticket's options. For example, for each new number, calculate the cumulative probability of it being used and update the state accordingly.

Transition: Use dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems. Create a recursive function that calculates the probability of correct numbering for each ticket, and use memoization to store the results of subproblems.

Base case: The base case is when there are no more tickets left (i.e., n = 0). In this case, the probability is simply 1.

Recursive case: For each ticket, calculate the cumulative probability of distinct numbers being used. If the current number has not been used before, update the state and recursively call the function for the remaining tickets. Otherwise, skip the current number and move on to the next one.

Edge cases: Handle edge cases where the first number can be either 1 or 2, by considering both possibilities separately.
