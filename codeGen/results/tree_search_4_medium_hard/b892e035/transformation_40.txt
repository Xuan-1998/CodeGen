===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

Let's define dp[i][j] as the probability that the first i tickets have been correctly numbered and the last ticket has the number j. The base case would be when all tickets have been processed (i.e., len(state) == n), in which case the probability is the product of the probabilities of the distinct numbers.

State: dp[i][j]
Transition:
    - If the current ticket's first number has a higher probability than its second number, then we only consider the first number as an option.
    - Otherwise, we consider both numbers as options and multiply their probabilities together.
Implement memoization using a dictionary, where the key is a tuple representing the current state (i, j) and the value is the calculated probability.

The plan can be improved by considering edge cases. For example, what happens when there are only two possible numbers? In this case, we should consider both numbers as options and return their product as the probability.

Additionally, we need to handle the case where there are more than 50 tickets (the constraint is 1 <= n <= 50). We can do this by using a loop that iterates over the number of tickets and uses memoization to store the calculated probabilities.

Finally, we should also consider rounding errors less than 10^-6 will be ignored. This means that when calculating the probability, we need to make sure it's rounded correctly.
