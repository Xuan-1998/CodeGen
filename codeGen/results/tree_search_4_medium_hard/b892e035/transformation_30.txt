State: The state could be a dictionary where the keys are the used numbers and values are their corresponding probabilities, and the transition relationship would involve updating the probabilities based on the current ticket's options.

Transition: Update the probabilities by multiplying the previous probability with the probability of the current ticket's numbers not being used. This can be done by iterating over the possible numbers for the current ticket and updating the probabilities accordingly.

Memoization: Implement memoization by using a dictionary to cache the intermediate results, reducing the computational complexity.

Initialization: Initialize an empty dictionary to store the state and a base probability of 1.

Base Case: The base case would be when there are no more tickets left to process. In this case, return the product of all probabilities in the current state.

Recurrence: For each ticket, calculate the transition probabilities by iterating over the possible numbers for that ticket and updating the state accordingly.

Edge Cases:
- Handle the edge case where a number is used more than once (in which case the probability is 0).
- Handle the edge case where no numbers are used (in which case the probability is 1).
