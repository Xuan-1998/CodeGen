===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probabilities of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The current set of distinct numbers
Transition: Add a new number to the set if it doesn't exist yet, or update the probability of the correct numbering given the previous tickets.

Base case: When there's only one possible combination left (i.e., n), in which case the probability is 1.

Dynamic programming approach:
- Initialize an array dp where dp[i] will store the probability of distinct numbers up to ticket i.
- For each ticket i, calculate the cumulative probability of distinct numbers by multiplying the probabilities of all previous tickets and adding the new number's probability (if it's not already in the set).
- Update the state by adding the new number to the set if it doesn't exist yet.

Edge cases: 
- When there are less than 2 tickets, the problem becomes trivial.
- When all tickets have the same numbers (i.e., A_i = B_i for all i), the correct numbering probability is 1.
