Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

The base case is when we have processed all tickets (i.e., i=n), in which case the probability of correct numbering is 1 if all numbers are distinct, and 0 otherwise. This base case ensures that the final answer is correctly calculated.

Let the state be a tuple (i, seen) where i is the current ticket index and seen is a set of unique numbers seen so far. The probability at this state is then calculated based on the probabilities of the two possible numbers for the current ticket.

If both numbers are unseen, add them to seen and recursively calculate the probability for the next ticket. This step ensures that the correct calculation takes place when new numbers are encountered.
If one or both numbers are seen before, directly return 1 if they are distinct, and 0 otherwise. This step handles edge cases where a number is repeated.

Implement memoization using a dictionary to store and reuse calculated probabilities, avoiding redundant calculations. This approach will significantly reduce the time complexity of the problem, especially when dealing with large input values.
