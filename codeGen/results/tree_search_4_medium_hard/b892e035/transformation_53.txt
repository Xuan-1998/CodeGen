===BEGIN PLAN===
Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

Let dp[i][j] be the state representing the probability of correct numbering up to i-th ticket with j as the last assigned number. We can initialize dp[0][0] to 1 (base case) and dp[0][1] to 1 since there are no tickets yet, so any assignment is correct.

For each subsequent ticket, we need to consider two possibilities: assigning the first or second number to this ticket. We can use the previous state dp[i-1][k] to calculate the probability of correct numbering if we assign the current number j to the i-th ticket. Then, we sum up these probabilities for both possible assignments and divide by 2 (since there are two possibilities) to get the overall probability.

The transition relationship would involve calculating the probability of assigning the next possible number correctly given the current assignment.

Apply dynamic programming by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using the solutions of these subproblems to build up the solution for larger instances. We can start with dp[0][0] and recursively fill in the dp table until we reach the desired state dp[n-1][j].

Let's also consider edge cases: when there are only two tickets, we know that they must have different numbers, so the probability is 1; when n is odd, we can treat it as an even case by assuming the middle ticket has a unique number.
