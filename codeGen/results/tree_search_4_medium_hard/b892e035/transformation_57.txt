Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

The base case is when we have processed all tickets (i.e., i = n), in which case the probability of correct numbering is 1 if all numbers are distinct, and 0 otherwise.

Let the state be a tuple (i, seen) where i is the current ticket index and seen is a set of unique numbers seen so far. The probability at this state is then calculated based on the probabilities of the two possible numbers for the current ticket.

If both numbers are unseen, add them to seen and recursively calculate the probability for the next ticket. If one or both numbers are seen before, directly return 1 if they are distinct and 0 otherwise.

The updated dynamic programming table would be initialized with zeros, where each cell (i, seen) represents the calculated probability at that state.

The time complexity of this plan is O(n * 2^n), where n is the number of tickets. This is because there are 2^(n-1) possible subsets of unique numbers seen so far, and for each subset, we recursively calculate the probability in O(n) time.

The space complexity is also O(n * 2^n) due to the memoization table.

This plan covers all edge cases, including when n = 0 (base case), when the number of tickets increases (dynamic programming), and when the probabilities of the two numbers for each ticket increase (memoization).
