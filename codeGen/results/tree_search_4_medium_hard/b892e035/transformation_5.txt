===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The state could be a tuple (n, prev_p1, prev_p2) where n is the current ticket number, prev_p1 and prev_p2 are the probabilities of the previous first and second numbers respectively.

The dynamic programming approach can be implemented as follows:

* Initialize a 3D array dp[50][17][17] to store the probabilities.
* For each ticket (n, p1, p2):
	+ Calculate the new probabilities for the first number: p1_new = p1 * (1 - prev_p1) and for the second number: p2_new = p2 * (1 - prev_p2)
	+ Update dp[n][p1_new][p2_new] to be the sum of:
		- The current probability
		- The product of the probabilities of all previous tickets
* Return dp[n][0][0]

This plan should correctly calculate the probability of a correct numbering.
