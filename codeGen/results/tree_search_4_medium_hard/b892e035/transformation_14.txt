===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The state could be a dictionary where the key is the number of unique combinations and the value is the corresponding probability. This allows us to keep track of the probabilities for each possible combination count.

State: Think of the state as a list or array representing the number of ways to choose the first, second, ..., (n-1)th distinct numbers from n possibilities, where each element in the list corresponds to the number of unique combinations left after considering the current ticket's options.

Transition relationship: Update this count based on the current ticket's options by recursively calculating the new possible combinations given the previous ticket's combination count.

Implement memoization using recursion, where the recursive function takes as input the current ticket's options and the previous ticket's combination count, and returns the updated combination count after considering the current ticket's options.

Base case: When all tickets have been processed (i.e., n-1 distinct numbers have been chosen), return 1, since this represents the only possible correct numbering.

Main function: Use a loop to process each test case, calculate the total number of unique combinations using dynamic programming, and then use the calculated probability as the answer for that test case.
