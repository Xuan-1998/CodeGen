The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probabilities for each possible outcome given the previous tickets.

The base case would be when all tickets have been processed (i.e., i == n), in which case the probability is either 1 if all numbers are distinct or 0 if not. This base case should handle edge cases where a single ticket is numbered or no tickets are numbered.

The state could be the set of unique numbers seen so far, and the transition relationship is updating this set with the new numbers from each ticket. Use dynamic programming to store previously calculated probabilities based on the number of distinct numbers seen so far.

For each possible outcome given the previous tickets, calculate the probability of distinct numbers for the current ticket being numbered as either number 1 or number 2.

Finally, use the base case and transition relationship to recursively calculate the overall probability of a correct numbering.

The plan should be more specific about how to handle the recursive calculations and edge cases. For instance, it's not clear what "use dynamic programming" means in practice.
