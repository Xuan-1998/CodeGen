===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The state could be a tuple containing two lists: one for the used numbers and one for their corresponding probabilities.
State: Use a tuple to store the cumulative probability of each number being used. Transition: For each ticket, calculate the cumulative probability of each number being used and update the state accordingly.

Memoize the function that calculates the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets, and use this memoized function in the main calculation loop.

Calculate the total probability by multiplying the probabilities of all the tickets. To avoid overcounting, divide the total probability by the number of possible orderings of the tickets (n!).

State: Initialize an empty tuple with two empty lists for used numbers and their corresponding probabilities.
Transition: For each ticket, iterate through its options and update the state accordingly. For each option, calculate the cumulative probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets using memoization.

Memoize function:
    - Calculate the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets by multiplying the probabilities of all the tickets that have been used so far.
    - Add this probability to a dictionary where the keys are the used numbers and values are their corresponding cumulative probabilities.

Main calculation loop:
    - Initialize an empty tuple for the state.
    - For each ticket, iterate through its options and update the state accordingly using memoization.
    - Calculate the total probability by multiplying the probabilities of all the tickets. To avoid overcounting, divide the total probability by the number of possible orderings of the tickets (n!).
