Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

Let the state be the current ticket index and the previous number assigned to a ticket, dp[i][j] represents the probability of correct numbering up to i-th ticket with j as the last assigned number.
dp[0][0] = 1 (base case: one ticket left with no distinct numbers seen)

Maintain a 3D array dp where dp[i][j][k] represents the probability that there are i distinct numbers seen, j tickets remaining, and k is the previous number assigned to a ticket.

Transition relationship:
- If the new ticket's first number is not seen before (i.e., it's a new distinct number), then update dp[i+1][j-1][k+1] by multiplying the current probability with the probability of the new ticket being numbered correctly.
- If the new ticket's second number is not seen before, then update dp[i+1][j-1][k+2] similarly.

Return dp[n][0][0] as the result (probability of correct numbering for all tickets).

Edge cases:
- Handle n = 0 case separately. If there are no tickets left to be numbered correctly, then the probability is 1.
