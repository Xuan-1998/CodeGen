===BEGIN PLAN===
Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

The base case is when we have processed all tickets (i.e., i=n), in which case the probability of correct numbering is 1 if all numbers are distinct, and 0 otherwise. This is because once all tickets are processed, it's either impossible or possible to have correct numbering based on whether all numbers are unique.

The state can be a set (seen) representing the unique numbers seen so far. The transition relationship involves checking if both numbers for the current ticket are distinct from those in seen, then recursively calculating the probability with the updated set. If not, return 0 as it is impossible to have correct numbering.

To avoid redundant calculations and memoize intermediate results, we can use a dictionary (dp) where dp[(P1, N1, N2)] represents the probability of correct numbering for the given ticket.

Memoization using a dictionary to store intermediate results:

For each ticket:
  If the ticket is processed correctly:
    Calculate the new set seen by adding the current numbers
    Check if both numbers are distinct from those in seen
      If yes, recursively calculate the probability with the updated set and memoize the result
      Else return 0 as it's impossible to have correct numbering

The final answer is the value for dp[()] which represents the probability of correct numbering for all tickets.
