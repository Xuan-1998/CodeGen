===BEGIN PLAN===
Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

Consider the state as a tuple containing the current ticket index and the total count of each possible number, dp[(i, (count1, count2))] represents the probability of correct numbering up to i-th ticket with k instances of each possible number.

Formulate dp[(i, (count1, count2))] as the maximum probability obtained by correctly or incorrectly numbering the i-th ticket given the counts of each possible number. When correctly numbering, the probability is P(i, 1) * (count1 / i) * (count2 / (i - 1)) times the probability of correct numbering up to the (i - 1)-th ticket with counts (count1 - 1, count2). When incorrectly numbering, the probability is the sum of probabilities for all possible numbers and their corresponding counts. This recursive formula can be memoized.

Use a dictionary memo = {} instead of an array dp to memoize the recursive function and avoid redundant calculations.

Calculate the final result as the maximum probability obtained by correctly or incorrectly numbering the last ticket given its count, which is calculated as n - (count1 + count2).
