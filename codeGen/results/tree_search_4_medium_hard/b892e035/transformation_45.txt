===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that the problem can be solved by solving smaller instances of itself, and the overlapping subproblems are the cases where the number of tickets changes but not the probabilities.

The state is the set of distinct numbers assigned to the first n-1 tickets, and the probability of assigning a new number to the nth ticket. Since each ticket has two possible numbers, we need to consider all possible assignments of these numbers to the first n-1 tickets.

The transition relationship is that the next state is a subset of the current state plus a new unique number assigned to the nth ticket. However, this approach doesn't take into account the constraints on the probabilities and the distinctness of numbers. We need to modify the plan to consider these constraints.

Use dynamic programming with bottom-up approach to build up a table with dimensions n and k, where n is the number of tickets and k is the total number of distinct numbers. Initialize the base cases for the first ticket (n=1) and then fill in the table based on the transition relationship.

To improve the plan, we can consider using a more efficient data structure to store the state, such as a bit vector or an array, instead of a set. This will reduce the time complexity of checking whether a number is already assigned.

Potential issues with the plan include:
* The current state and next state may have different sizes, which could lead to incorrect results.
* The transition relationship may not correctly capture the constraints on the probabilities and distinctness of numbers.
* The plan does not account for edge cases such as when all tickets have the same number or when there is only one possible number.

To address these issues, we need to modify the plan to consider these constraints and edge cases. We can do this by adding more conditions to the transition relationship and using a more robust data structure.
