===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The current set of distinct numbers
Transition: Add a new number to the set if it doesn't exist yet, or update the probability of the correct numbering given the previous tickets

The plan seems mostly correct. However, there are some potential issues that need to be addressed:

* What if two or more tickets have the same number? In this case, we would need to handle the overlap between the sets of distinct numbers.
* The plan does not specify how to calculate the probability of a correct numbering given the previous tickets. We would need to implement a recursive function that takes into account the probabilities of the individual tickets.

To improve the plan, we can add more details on how to handle these issues:

* When calculating the probability of distinct numbers, we can use a set to keep track of unique numbers.
* To calculate the probability of a correct numbering given the previous tickets, we can implement a recursive function that takes into account the probabilities of the individual tickets.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
