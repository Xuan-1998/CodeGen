===BEGIN PLAN===
Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

The base case is when we have processed all tickets (i.e., i=n), in which case the probability of correct numbering is 1 if all numbers are distinct, and 0 otherwise. This ensures that our plan has a clear termination condition.

The state is a binary vector representing whether each number has been used so far, with the transition relationship being the probability of correct numbering given the current ticket's numbers and the used numbers. We can represent this using a tuple (used_numbers, correct) where used_numbers is the binary vector and correct is a boolean indicating whether the last ticket was correctly numbered.

We use memoization by storing the intermediate results in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations. This ensures that our plan has an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n*2^n).

The key idea is to maintain a state transition function that takes the current state and the next ticket as input, and returns the updated state and the probability of correct numbering given the new state. The base case is when all tickets have been processed, in which case the probability of correct numbering is 1 if all numbers are distinct, and 0 otherwise.

Finally, we initialize the memoization dictionary with the base case, and then recursively calculate the probabilities for each ticket using the transition function.
