plan:
Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations. 
Consider the state as a tuple containing the current ticket index and the total count of each possible number, dp[(i, k)] represents the probability of correct numbering up to i-th ticket with k instances of each possible number.
Formulate dp[(i, (count1, count2))] as the maximum probability obtained by correctly or incorrectly numberding the i-th ticket given the counts of each possible number.
Implement a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming by iterating through the tickets from 0 to n-1, and for each ticket, calculate the maximum probability obtained by correctly or incorrectly numbering it given the counts of each possible number.
