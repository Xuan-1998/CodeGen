1. Initialize a dictionary dp with default value 0 and a variable res = 0;
2. Define a function dfs(n, i, last):
    - If n == 0, return 1 (base case for no tickets left);
    - For each pair of numbers and probabilities in the list:
        - Calculate the probability to assign this number as the next one.
        - Update dp[i][j] with this calculated value;
        - Update res with the maximum of current res and this calculated value;
3. Initialize res = 0 and call dfs(n, n-1, -1);
4. Print res;
