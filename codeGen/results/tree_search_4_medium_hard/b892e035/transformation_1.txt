===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The state could be (n, p1, p2) where n is the current ticket number and p1, p2 are the probabilities of the first and second numbers respectively. This represents the dynamic programming approach.

Base Case: The base case would be when we have processed all the tickets (i.e., i = n). In this case, the probability of a correct numbering would be 1 if the last ticket's number is distinct from all previously used numbers.

Transition Function: For each new ticket, we update the probabilities based on the two possible numbers and their corresponding probabilities. The transition function could be:

- If the current ticket's first number has not been used before (i.e., mask & (1 << (first - 1)) == 0), then the probability of using this number is p1.
- If the current ticket's second number has not been used before, then the probability of using this number is p2.

Update State: We update the state by incrementing i and updating the mask accordingly. For each new ticket, we update the probabilities based on the two possible numbers and their corresponding probabilities.

Return Value: The final return value would be the product of all the transition probabilities.
