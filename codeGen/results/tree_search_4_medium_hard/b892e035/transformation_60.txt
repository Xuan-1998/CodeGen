Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

The base case is when we have processed all tickets (i.e., i=n), in which case the probability of correct numbering is 1 if all numbers are distinct, and 0 otherwise. 

The state can be a tuple (i, p1, p2) where i is the current ticket index, p1 is the cumulative probability of the first number being correct up to this point, and p2 is the cumulative probability of the second number being correct. The transition relationship involves updating these probabilities based on the new ticket information.

Use a dictionary-based memoization approach where the keys are tuples representing the state (i, p1, p2) and the values are the calculated probabilities.
