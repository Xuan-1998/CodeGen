===BEGIN PLAN===
Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

The base case is when we have processed all tickets (i.e., i=n), in which case the probability of correct numbering is 1 if all numbers are distinct, and 0 otherwise. This is because the first number cannot be repeated, so it's either correct or not.

The state can be a tuple (i, p1, p2) where i is the current ticket index, p1 is the cumulative probability of the first number being correct up to this point, and p2 is the cumulative probability of the second number being correct. The transition relationship involves updating these probabilities based on the new ticket information.

The table can be initialized with base cases for i=0 (i.e., no tickets processed), where p1=1 and p2=1. Then, fill up the table recursively or iteratively by considering all possible outcomes for each ticket: either the first number is correct or not, and similarly for the second number.

To avoid overcounting, we can consider the cases when both numbers are correct or incorrect separately. This means we need a 4D array (i, p1, p2, correct) to keep track of whether the current ticket's numbers are correct or not.

Finally, return the value at the top-right corner of the table (i=n, p1=1, p2=1, correct=True), which represents the probability of all tickets having distinct numbers and being numbered correctly.
