===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[(i, count1, count2)] represents the probability of correct numbering up to i-th ticket with counts of first and second numbers being count1 and count2 respectively.

For each ticket (i), calculate the probability of correct numbering up to the current ticket considering both possible numbers.
If the current ticket has a distinct number from previously seen numbers, update dp[(i, 0, 0)] by multiplying it with the probability that this new number does not appear in the first count1 instances or second count2 instances. Update dp[(i, k, 0)] and dp[(i, 0, k)] similarly.
Memoize these probabilities to avoid redundant calculations.

When calculating the final answer for each test case, sum up the probabilities of correct numbering for all tickets and return it as the result.

This plan correctly captures the essence of the problem. It's a good approach to solve this problem using dynamic programming with memoization.

However, there is still room for improvement. The plan should be more detailed and specify how to handle edge cases like the first ticket or when one number has appeared many times before another.
