===BEGIN PLAN===
Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

Consider the state as a tuple containing the current ticket index and the total count of each possible number, dp[(i, (count1, count2))] represents the probability of correct numbering up to i-th ticket with k instances of each possible number. 

dp[(i, (count1, count2))] represents the total count of first and second numbers up to i-th ticket.
dp[i-1] * P_i gives the transition relationship.

The updated state dp[(i+1, (new_count1, new_count2))] is calculated based on the previous state and the current ticket's probability. The base case for the recursion is when i equals n, which represents the last ticket in the sequence.

To apply a bottom-up approach by iteratively updating the probabilities based on the transition relationship. 

The plan includes edge cases where the initial counts of each possible number are set to 0 and the initial state dp[(0, (0, 0))] is set to 1.
