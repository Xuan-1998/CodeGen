===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The state could be the total number of possible unique number combinations, and the transition relationship would involve calculating the new possible combinations given the current ticket's options.
State: Think of the state as the number of unique combinations of distinct numbers left to be considered, where each combination is represented by a set of two-bit integers (00, 01, 10, or 11) indicating whether the corresponding number has been used yet. The transition relationship involves updating this count based on the current ticket's options.

Utilize a dynamic programming approach with a state transition function that updates the count based on the current ticket's options, and uses memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
Transition: For each ticket, update the count of possible unique combinations by considering both number possibilities. If a number is not used yet (represented by 0 bits), add the number of combinations where it can be used; if a number is already used (represented by 1 bits), subtract the number of combinations where it cannot be used.
Memoization: Store the count for each unique combination in a memo array, so that when calculating the probability for the same unique combination again, we can directly retrieve the stored value instead of recalculating.
