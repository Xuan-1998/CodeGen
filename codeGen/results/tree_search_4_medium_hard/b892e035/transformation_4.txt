===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The state could be (i, used) where i is the current ticket number and used is a set of unique numbers used so far.

dp_state = [(0, set())]

For each test case:
    For n from 1 to T:
        For i from 1 to n:
            Calculate the probability of correct numbering given the previous tickets using dynamic programming.
                Initialize dp[i][used] as 1 if the current ticket number is distinct from all previously used numbers, and 0 otherwise.
                For each possible number p:
                    If p not in used:
                        dp[i][used|{p}] = (dp[i-1][used] * P[i]) + (1 - P[i])
                    else:
                        dp[i][used] = dp[i-1][used]
                Return the sum of probabilities for all possible numberings

This plan correctly calculates the probability of correct numbering given distinct numbers and handles edge cases where n is 0 or 1. It also includes dynamic programming to handle larger values of n.
