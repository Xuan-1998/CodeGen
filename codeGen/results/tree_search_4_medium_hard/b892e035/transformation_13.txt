===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The state could be the total number of possible unique number combinations. Initialize a table with dimensions (n+1, 2^16), where n is the number of tickets and 2^16 represents all possible distinct numbers.

Transition relationship: For each ticket, calculate the new possible combinations given the current ticket's options. This can be done by iterating over all possible subsets of used numbers and updating the count based on the current ticket's probabilities.

Bottom-up dynamic programming approach:
1. Initialize the base case for the first ticket: 2 possible unique number combinations (00 or 11).
2. For each subsequent ticket, iterate over all possible subsets of used numbers.
3. For each subset, calculate the probability of distinct numbers given the current ticket's options and update the count based on this probability.
4. The final answer is the sum of probabilities for all possible subsets.
