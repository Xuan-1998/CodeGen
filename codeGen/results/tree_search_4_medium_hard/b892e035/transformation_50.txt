Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

Let the state be the current ticket index and the previous number assigned to a ticket, dp[i][j] represents the probability of correct numbering up to i-th ticket with j as the last assigned number.

The transition relationship would involve calculating the probability of assigning the next possible number correctly given the current assignment. This can be done by considering all possible numbers for the (i+1)-th ticket and then calculating the probability that each of these numbers is correct, taking into account the previously drawn number j.

Let's initialize dp[0][0] to 1 as there are no tickets yet, so the probability of correct numbering is 100%.

For i > 0, for each possible previous number j, calculate the probability that the i-th ticket has a certain number (A or B) assigned to it correctly given that the previous number was j. This can be done by multiplying the probabilities of drawing A and B correctly.

Fill up the dp table in order of increasing ticket index and previously drawn numbers. Finally, return dp[n-1][0] as this is the probability of correct numbering for all tickets with the first number assigned to the first ticket.
