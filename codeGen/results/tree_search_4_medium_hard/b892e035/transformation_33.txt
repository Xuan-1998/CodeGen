The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The state could be a dictionary where the keys are the used numbers and values are their corresponding probabilities.
Transition: For each ticket, calculate the cumulative probability of each number being used and update the state accordingly. This involves updating the probability for each number to be used, considering the current ticket's options.

Use dynamic programming to solve this problem by creating a table dp where dp[i][j] represents the probability that the first i tickets have distinct numbers, and the jth ticket is numbered with its first or second number.

dp[0][0] = 1 (base case), dp[0][1] = 0 (base case)
For each ticket i from 1 to n:
    For each possible numbering of the current ticket j (0 or 1):
        Calculate the probability that all previous tickets have distinct numbers and the current ticket is numbered with its jth number. This involves multiplying the probabilities of the previous tickets being correctly numbered, and then updating the probabilities based on the current ticket's options.
    Update dp[i][j] accordingly.

Use the dynamic programming table to calculate the final answer as the sum of the probabilities for each possible numbering of the last ticket.
