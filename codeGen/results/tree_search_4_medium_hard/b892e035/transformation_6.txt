Plan:
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The state could be (n, prev_p1, prev_p2) where n is the current ticket number, prev_p1 and prev_p2 are the probabilities of the previous first and second numbers respectively.

Memoization with a state of (i, mask) where i is the current ticket number and mask is a binary mask representing the numbers that have been used so far. The subproblem for each state would be to calculate the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets, taking into account the probabilities of the first and second numbers.

Base case: For the base case, when all tickets have been used (i.e., i equals n), the probability of correct numbering is simply the product of the probabilities of the first and second numbers for each ticket. The state would be (n, prev_p1, prev_p2).

Recursive case: In the recursive case, the probability of correct numbering would depend on the number of distinct numbers used so far. If there are no repeated numbers, then the probability is simply the product of the probabilities of the first and second numbers for each ticket. However, if there are repeated numbers, then we need to consider the cases where the current number is equal to or different from the previous number.

The base case can be handled by initializing a variable for the total probability and updating it as we calculate the probability for each state. The recursive case can be handled by calculating the probabilities of distinct numbers given the previous tickets, taking into account the probabilities of the first and second numbers.

To improve the plan, we could consider using dynamic programming with memoization to avoid redundant calculations. We would also need to handle edge cases such as when there are fewer than two distinct numbers used so far.
