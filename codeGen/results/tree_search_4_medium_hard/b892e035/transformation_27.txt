===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

The base case would be when there's only one possible combination left (i.e., n == 1), in which case the probability is that single combination's value, which is simply P_0 * B_0 + P_1 * A_0.

A bitmask representing which numbers have been seen so far, Transition: Update the bitmask by setting the bits corresponding to the new numbers.

Design a recursive function dp(i, seen) that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations. The function takes two arguments: i, the current ticket index, and seen, the bitmask of seen numbers.
The base case would be when there's only one possible combination left (i.e., i == n), in which case the probability is simply 1.

The transition rule would be dp(i + 1, seen | 2^A_i) + dp(i + 1, seen | 2^B_i).

Use memoization to store the intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
