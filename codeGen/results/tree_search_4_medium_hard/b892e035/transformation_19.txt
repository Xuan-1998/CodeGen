===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probabilities of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The current set of distinct numbers and the corresponding probabilities, Transition: Add a new number to the set if it doesn't exist yet, or update the probability of the correct numbering given the previous tickets.

Base Case: When there's only one possible combination left (i.e., n=1), in which case the probability is that single combination's value.

Dynamic Programming:
Consider using a 3D table, where:
    - The first dimension represents the current ticket number (1 to n),
    - The second dimension represents the previous distinct numbers,
    - The third dimension represents the possible numbers for each ticket.
Fill up the table by iterating through each ticket, considering all previous combinations and calculating the probability of correct numbering.

Edge Cases: 
- When there's only one possible combination left (i.e., n=1), return that single combination's value.
- If a new number is added to the set but it already exists, update the corresponding probability.

Note: The plan seems to be correct, and edge cases are considered. However, further analysis or implementation might reveal specific issues or improvements needed.
