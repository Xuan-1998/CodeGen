===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probabilities of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

* Initialize a 2D array dp[][] with size n+1 x (16^2 + 1) where each cell represents the probability of correct numbering for i tickets and j seen numbers.
* Base case: When there's only one possible combination left (i.e., n), in which case the probability is that single combination's value. So, dp[n][0] = 1, and dp[i][j] = 0 if j > 16^2 - 1 or j < 0.
* Transition: For each ticket i from 1 to n:
    * Initialize a variable p_sum = 0, which will store the sum of probabilities for all possible combinations considering this ticket.
    * Iterate over all seen numbers j from 0 to 16^2 - 1:
        * Calculate the probability of correct numbering for this ticket given j as (A_i / 100) * (B_i / 100) if j & (1 << A_i) and j & (1 << B_i), or 0 otherwise. Add this value to p_sum.
    * Update dp[i][j] = p_sum / ((2^16 - 1 - j + 1) * (i-1)).
* Return the last element of the dp array, which represents the probability of correct numbering for n tickets.
