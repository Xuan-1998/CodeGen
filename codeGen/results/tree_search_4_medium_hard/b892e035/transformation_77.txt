1. Initialize an array dp[][] where dp[i][j] will store the probability that all numbers up to i are distinct and j is the number used in the ith ticket.
2. In the base case, if i = n, then return 1 if all numbers up to i are distinct, and 0 otherwise.
3. For each ticket from i-1 down to 0:
    a. Initialize an array p[] of size m where p[k] is the probability that number k is not used in any previous ticket.
    b. Calculate the transition probabilities for this ticket, considering all possible numbers up to m.
    c. Update dp[i][j] as the sum of the products of the transition probabilities and the probabilities that each number up to m is distinct.
4. The final result will be stored in dp[0][j], where j is the first used number in the tickets.
