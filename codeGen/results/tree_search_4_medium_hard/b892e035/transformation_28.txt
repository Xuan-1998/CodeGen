The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The state could be a 2D array where the first dimension represents the number of used numbers and the second dimension represents the number of remaining tickets. The value at each cell would represent the probability of correct numbering given the used numbers and the number of remaining tickets.

Transition: For each ticket, update the probabilities in the dynamic programming states by multiplying the previous probability with the probability of the current ticket's numbers not being used. This can be done by considering all possible combinations of the two numbers on the current ticket and updating the corresponding cells in the 2D array accordingly.

Initial State: The initial state would represent the base case where there are no used numbers and n remaining tickets, with a probability of correct numbering equal to 1 (since any combination of numbers is possible).

Terminal State: The terminal state would be reached when all tickets have been processed, and it would represent the final probability of correct numbering.

Edge Cases: Handle edge cases by considering what happens when there are no used numbers and n remaining tickets (the initial state), or when all numbers have been used and only one ticket remains (the terminal state).
