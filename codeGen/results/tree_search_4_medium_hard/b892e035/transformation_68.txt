===BEGIN PLAN===
Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

Consider the state as a tuple containing the current ticket index and the total count of each possible number. dp[(i, k)] represents the probability of correct numbering up to i-th ticket with k instances of each possible number.

dp[(i, count1, count2)] represents the probability of correct numbering up to i-th ticket with counts of first and second numbers being count1 and count2 respectively.

Let's initialize dp[0][k] for all k as 1.0 (since there are no tickets yet).

For each ticket from 1 to n:
	* If the current ticket has a unique number, update dp[(i, count1 + 1, count2)] accordingly.
	* If the current ticket has a repeat of either numbers, consider both cases: 
		+ Update dp[(i, count1, count2)] by multiplying it with the probability of correct numbering up to i-1-th ticket and considering this case as one possible outcome.
		+ For each count combination that leads to this case (e.g., if the first number is repeated, try both possible counts), update dp[(i, new_count1, new_count2)] accordingly.

Finally, calculate the probability of correct numbering for the entire set of tickets and return it.
