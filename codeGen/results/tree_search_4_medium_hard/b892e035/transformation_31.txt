===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The state could be a 2D table where the rows represent the number of tickets and the columns represent the possible numbers on each ticket. The value at each cell would represent the probability that the correct numbering is achievable given the first i tickets with j numbers.
Transition: Update the state by calculating the probabilities for each possible distinct combination of numbers for the current ticket, based on the probabilities from the previous ticket. For each combination, calculate the product of the probabilities and add it to the corresponding cell in the table.

State: The initial state would be a 2D table initialized with all zeros.
Transition: Initialize the first row with probabilities of 1, since there are no tickets yet.

The dynamic programming solution can be implemented using a loop that iterates over the number of tickets and the possible numbers on each ticket. For each combination of numbers, calculate the probability based on the previous ticket's options and update the corresponding cell in the table.
Return the value at the last cell in the table, which represents the probability of correct numbering for all tickets.
