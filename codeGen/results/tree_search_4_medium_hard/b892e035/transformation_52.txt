===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i][j] be the probability that the i-th ticket has the j-th number assigned to it.

For n tickets, define a function f(i, j) as follows:

f(i, 0) = p[i][0], where p[i][0] is the probability of assigning the first possible number correctly given the current assignment

f(i, 1) = p[i][1], where p[i][1] is the probability of assigning the second possible number correctly given the current assignment

For i > 1 and j > 1,

f(i, j) = (p[i][0] * f(i-1, 0) + p[i][1] * f(i-1, 1)) / (p[i][0] + p[i][1])

This function calculates the probability that the i-th ticket has the j-th number assigned to it given the current assignment.

Let memo be a dictionary for memoization.

Define a recursive function solve(n) as follows:

solve(0) = 1, since there is only one possible way to assign numbers to the first ticket

For n > 0,

solve(n) = sum(f(n, j) * (1 - p[n][j-1]) for j in range(2))

This function calculates the probability of correct numbering up to the i-th ticket with memoization.

Finally, return solve(n) as the answer.
