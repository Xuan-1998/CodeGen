===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: The state could be a dictionary where the keys are tuples representing the used numbers and their corresponding probabilities, and the values are the calculated probabilities. This allows for efficient lookup and memoization.

Transition: Update the state by considering all possible outcomes (i.e., the two options for each ticket) and recursively calculating the probabilities for each subproblem.

Memoization: Store the results of each subproblem in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.

State transition: If the current ticket's numbers are distinct from the previously used numbers, add them to the state and update the probabilities accordingly. Otherwise, update the probabilities based on the previous state.

Edge cases:
- Handle the base case where n is 0 or 1 (i.e., no tickets or only one ticket).
- Ensure that the state transition handles the edge case where all tickets have the same numbers.
- Consider handling floating-point precision errors by using a threshold value for equality checks.
