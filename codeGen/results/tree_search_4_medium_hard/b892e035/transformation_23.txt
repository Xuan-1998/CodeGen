The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

The base case would be when there's only one possible combination left (i.e., n == 1), in which case the probability is simply the product of the probabilities of each ticket number being correct. This is because there's only one way to assign a unique number to each ticket.

The recurrence relation: If the current combination is valid (i.e., all numbers are different), calculate the probability of this combination and add it to the total probability. The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of all possible combinations.

Implement memoization using a dictionary to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations. This will significantly improve performance by reducing the number of recursive calls.

Edge cases: Handle the case where n == 1 separately, as described above.
