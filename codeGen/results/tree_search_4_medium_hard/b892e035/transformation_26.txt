===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

Let dp[i][j] be the probability that the first i tickets have distinct numbers and the last ticket has the j-th number (1-indexed). Then we have:

dp[0][0] = 1, // base case: one empty set
for i from 1 to n:
    for j from 1 to 2:
        p = probability of the j-th number // get the probability from input
        dp[i][j] = (1 - p) * sum(dp[k][x] for k from 0 to i-1, x from 1 to 2)
        // update the bitmask by setting the bits corresponding to the new numbers
        bitmask = 
    return max(dp[n][1], dp[n][2]) // choose the highest probability

Implement memoization using a dictionary to store the intermediate results.
