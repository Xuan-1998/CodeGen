===BEGIN PLAN===
Top-down approach with memoization is suitable because it involves recursive calls to calculate the probability of correct numbering, and memoization can help avoid redundant calculations.

The base case is when we have processed all tickets (i.e., i=n), in which case the probability of correct numbering is 1 if all numbers are distinct, and 0 otherwise. We can use a set to store the unique numbers seen so far to check for distinctness.

The state can be a tuple (i, p1, p2) where i is the current ticket index, p1 is the cumulative probability of the first number being correct up to this point, and p2 is the cumulative probability of the second number being correct. The transition relationship involves updating these probabilities based on the new ticket information.

We can use a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary or set to store previously computed probabilities. For each new ticket, we update the state by considering two cases: the first number matches the previous ticket's first number and the second number does not match any previous tickets' numbers; or the first number does not match the previous ticket's first number.

We can memoize the results of these recursive calls based on the current state (i, p1, p2) to avoid redundant calculations. The base case remains the same: when we have processed all tickets, the probability of correct numbering is 1 if all numbers are distinct, and 0 otherwise.
