===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

State: Define the state as a pair (a, b), where a and b are the counts of distinct numbers that have been correctly numbered so far for the first and second numbers, respectively. The transition relationships involve updating these counts based on the current ticket's options.

Transition relationships:
- If the current ticket's first number is different from any previously used first number (a < n), increment a.
- If the current ticket's second number is different from any previously used second number (b < n), increment b.
- Update the state accordingly: if a or b reaches n, it means all numbers have been correctly numbered and the process terminates.

Memoization:
Implement memoization using a dictionary where the key is the current state (a, b) and the value is the corresponding probability. This allows us to avoid redundant calculations by storing previously computed probabilities.

Base case: The base case would be when a or b equals n, indicating all numbers have been correctly numbered, at which point we can calculate the final probability based on the given probabilities of each number.

Correctness:
The plan appears correct in terms of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given previous tickets. However, it's important to consider edge cases and handle them accordingly.

Edge cases:
- What if there are less than n tickets? In this case, we can stop once all possible combinations have been correctly numbered.
- How do we handle cases where not all numbers appear on a ticket?
- What if the same number appears multiple times?

Improvement:
One potential improvement is to consider optimizing the memoization dictionary by using a more efficient data structure or pruning redundant calculations. Additionally, careful handling of edge cases could ensure the plan remains robust.
