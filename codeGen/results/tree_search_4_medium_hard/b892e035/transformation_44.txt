The problem involves calculating the probability of a correct numbering, which can be broken down into subproblems of calculating the probability of distinct numbers given the previous tickets.

Let dp[i][j] denote the probability that the first i tickets have distinct numbers, where j is the current number being considered. Then:

- The base case would be when all tickets have been processed (i.e., len(state) == n), in which case the probability is the product of the probabilities of the distinct numbers.
- The state is the set of possible correct numberings.
- The transition is the update when a new ticket is processed: dp[i][j] = P_i * (1 - sum(P_k for k in range(i))) where P_i and P_k are the probabilities of the i-th and k-th tickets being numbered with j.

To utilize the strengths of both tabulation and memoization, implement dynamic programming using a 2D array. The time complexity is O(n*16) as there are at most 16 possible numbers per ticket, where n is the number of tickets. The space complexity is also O(n*16).

The plan does not include edge cases but can be easily extended to handle them.
