The state can be defined as (t) where t is the time from the start of the level; The base case is when all monsters have been killed or the level has ended.

Create a 2D table dp of size (n+1) x (max(k) + 1), where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum mana required to kill i-th monster by time j with j seconds of mana used.

For each monster, iterate over all previous times and update dp[i][k] as min(dp[i-1][k]+(k-h[i-1])%2) for k in range(h[0],i+1).

The final answer is the minimum value in the last row (dp[n][j] for j in range(max(k) + 1)).

This plan seems correct, but it can be improved by initializing dp correctly and handling edge cases properly.
