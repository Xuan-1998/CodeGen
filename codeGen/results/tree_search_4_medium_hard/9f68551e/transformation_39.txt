State represents the maximum mana that can be achieved at each second, considering the current monster's appearance time and health.
The base case is when there are no more monsters to kill.

Use a 2D array dp[][] to store the minimum mana required at each second to kill all monsters up to that moment. 
dp[i][j] will represent the minimum mana required to kill all monsters up to the i-th monster's appearance time, considering the current monster is the j-th one (1-indexed).
For each monster:
  - For every previous monster (up to the current one), calculate the maximum damage achievable at its appearance time.
    This can be done by iterating over all previous monsters and finding the maximum damage that kills the current monster.
  - Add the health of the current monster to this maximum damage. This is because we need to kill the current monster with a spell that has enough damage to exceed its health.
  - dp[i][j] will be the minimum between the current value (dp[i-1][k]) and the new calculated value.

The final answer will be the value in the last row of the dp[][] array, which represents the minimum mana required to kill all monsters.
