DP Plan:
\

The state represents the minimum mana required to kill all monsters up until each monster's appearance time, considering the current monster's health and the previous damage.

Base Case: When the monster's health equals its appearance time, no further action is needed. The base case value for this cell would be 0.

Recurrence Relation:

* If the current monster's health is greater than or equal to its appearance time, the minimum mana required is the same as the previous monster.
* If the current monster's health is less than its appearance time, consider two options:
	+ Cast a spell with damage equal to the previous monster's damage (previous damage + 1) and use that damage to kill the current monster. The minimum mana required would be the previous monster's value plus the current monster's health minus the current monster's appearance time.
	+ Cast a spell with damage 1 and use that damage to kill the current monster. The minimum mana required would be the same as the previous monster.

Initialize the DP table with 0s for all cells representing the base case (monster's health equals its appearance time).

Fill in the DP table row by row, considering each monster's appearance time and health. For each cell, calculate the minimum mana required based on the recurrence relation.
