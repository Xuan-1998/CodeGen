Let's define the state as dp[i][j] = minimum mana required to kill all monsters that appear up to the i-th second, where 1 <= i < n and 0 <= j <= k_i. The base case is when i == 0 or j >= h_1 (the health of the first monster), so dp[0][j] = j + 1 and dp[i][k_i] = h_i for all i.
dp[i][j] represents the minimum mana required to kill all monsters that appear up to the i-th second, with the assumption that the wizard cast a spell at the (i-1)-th second with damage j. The state transitions from dp[i-1][j'] to dp[i][max(j', h_i)] when a new monster appears at time k_i.
Design a tabulation solution by initializing a 2D table and iteratively updating each cell based on previous values. The final answer is dp[n-1][0], the minimum mana required to kill all monsters that appear in the entire level, assuming no spell was cast before the first second.
