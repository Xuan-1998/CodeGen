===BEGIN PLAN===

Let's define the state as dp[i] = maximum health of i-th and (i+1)-th monster, where 1 <= i < n. The base case is when i == n-1, so dp[n-1] = h_n.

Let dp[i] be the minimum mana required to kill all monsters up to the i-th second. Then, we have:
dp[0] = 0
For i > 0, if k_i > i:
dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], h_i) + 1
Else:
dp[i] = dp[k_i-1] + (i - k_i + 1)

Memoization using recursion: Define a recursive function f(i) that returns the minimum mana required to kill all monsters up to the i-th second, and use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values.
