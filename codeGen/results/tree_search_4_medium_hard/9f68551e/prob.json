"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given the appearance time and health of $n$ monsters, a wizard apprentice can cast a spell with varying damage at positive integer amounts of seconds after the start of the level to kill the monsters. The damage of the spell is calculated based on the previous second's damage and uses mana. The apprentice has to cast the spell at the exact moment a monster appears, and the damage must be greater than or equal to the monster's health. Find the least amount of mana required to kill all monsters.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of multiple test cases, where each test case contains the number of monsters $n$, the appearance time of each monster $k_i$, and the health of each monster $h_i$. The input is read from standard input. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\\\le n \\\\le 100$) \\u2014 the number of monsters in the level. The second line of the testcase contains $n$ integers $k_1 < k_2 < \\\\dots < k_n$ ($1 \\\\le k_i \\\\le 10^9$) \\u2014 the number of seconds from the start the $i$-th monster appears at. All $k_i$ are different, $k_i$ are provided in the increasing order. The third line of the testcase contains $n$ integers $h_1, h_2, \\\\dots, h_n$ ($1 \\\\le h_i \\\\le k_i \\\\le 10^9$) \\u2014 the health of the $i$-th monster.\\n\\nOutput: The output should be printed to standard output. For each testcase, print a single integer \\u2014 the least amount of mana required for the wizard apprentice to kill all monsters.\\n\\nConstraints: The number of test cases $t$ is $1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$, the appearance time of each monster $k_i$ is $1 \\\\le k_i \\\\le 10^9$, and the health of each monster $h_i$ is $1 \\\\le h_i \\\\le k_i \\\\le 10^9$. The sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $10^4$. The damage of the spell is calculated as follows: if the wizard apprentice didn't cast the spell at the previous second, the damage is $1$. Otherwise, let the damage at the previous second be $x$. Then the apprentice can choose the damage to be either $x + 1$ or $1$. A spell uses mana: casting a spell with damage $x$ uses $x$ mana. Mana doesn't regenerate. The apprentice can cast the spell even when there is no monster at the current second. The apprentice has to cast the spell at the exact moment a monster appears, and the damage must be greater than or equal to the monster's health.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Sorting', 'Amortized analysis', 'Implementation', 'Greedy algorithms', 'Dynamic programming', 'Mathematics', 'Data structures']\", \"difficulties\": \"MEDIUM_HARD\", \"source\": \"codeforces\", \"url\": \"https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1626/C\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"3\\n1\\n6\\n4\\n2\\n4 5\\n2 2\\n3\\n5 7 9\\n2 1 2\\n\", \"output\": \"10\\n6\\n7\\n\"}]}"
