===BEGIN PLAN===
\
The state can be defined as dp[i][j] = minimum mana required to kill i monsters with j seconds left, where 1 <= i <= n and 0 <= j <= k_n. The base case is when i == n, meaning all monsters are killed, so dp[i][j] = 0 for all j.
\
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][max(0, j-k_i)] + h_i, dp[i][j]) if j >= k_i
Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table and update it from top to bottom and left to right.
