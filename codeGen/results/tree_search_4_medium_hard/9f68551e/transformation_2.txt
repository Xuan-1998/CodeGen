    dp[i][t] = min(dp[i-1][max(0, t-k_i+1)] + h_i, dp[i-1][k_i-1])
    i: 0 to n
    t: 0 to max(k)
}
The state can be defined as (i, t) where i is the current monster index and t is the time until the next monster appearance; The base case is when there are no more monsters to cast spells on.
The dynamic programming table dp[i][t] represents the minimum amount of mana required to kill all monsters up to the i-th one at time t.
You can use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations, which is equivalent to memoization.
The transition equation calculates the minimum amount of mana required to kill all monsters up to the i-th one at time t as the minimum between two possibilities: 
1. Kill the current monster with damage equal to its health and use the remaining mana for the next monster; 
2. Skip the current monster and use the remaining mana for the next monster.
The base case is when there are no more monsters to cast spells on, which means the minimum amount of mana required is 0.
You can fill in the dynamic programming table by iterating through all possible states (i, t) from top to bottom and left to right. 
Then you can read off the answer as dp[n][max(k)]
