The state can be defined as dp[i] = minimum mana required to kill all monsters that appear at or before time i, where 1 <= i <= k_n. The base case is when there are no more monsters, so dp[k_n] = 0.
dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + max(health of monster that appears at time i - 1) - health of monster that appears at time i) if i > 1, else infinity
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by iterating from k_1 to k_n and updating dp[i] using the recurrence relation above.
