The state can be defined as dp[k_i] = minimum mana required to kill the i-th monster, where 1 <= k_i <= k_n. The base case is when there are no more monsters, so dp[j] = infinity for all j > k_n.

dp[k_i] = min(dp[k_(i-1)] + (k_i - k_(i-1)), dp[k_(n-1) - k_i]) if i != n, else 0

Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by initializing a table of size k_n+1 and filling it in a top-down manner.
