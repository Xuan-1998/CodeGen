state represents maximum damage/mana that can be achieved at each monster's appearance time
considering current monster's health and previous damage/mana
base case: when monster's health equals its appearance time

state1 = 0, for all monsters (initialize)
for each monster from right to left:
    if monster's health is less than or equal to its appearance time:
        state2 = monster's health
    else:
        state2 = max(state1 + monster's health - previous damage/mana, state1) + previous damage/mana
    state1 = state2

output the last value of state1 as the least amount of mana required to kill all monsters
