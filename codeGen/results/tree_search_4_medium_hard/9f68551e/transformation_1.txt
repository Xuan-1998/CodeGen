The state can be defined as (i, t) where i is the current monster index and t is the time until the next monster appearance; 
The base case is when there are no more monsters to cast spells on. If i == n, return 0.

Memoization can be achieved by defining a function dp(i, t) that takes (i, t) as input and returns the minimum mana required to kill the first i monsters at time t. 

For each subproblem dp(i, t), calculate the minimum mana in two ways:
1. Don't cast a spell at time t, so we need dp(i-1, k_i - 1) mana to kill the first i-1 monsters at time k_i - 1.
2. Cast a spell with damage h_i at time t, so we need t mana to cast the spell and dp(i-1, k_i - t - 1) mana to kill the rest of the monsters.

Choose the minimum between these two cases.

The final answer is dp(n, n), which represents the minimum mana required to kill all monsters.
