===BEGIN PLAN===
The state represents the maximum damage that can be achieved at each second, considering the current monster's appearance time and health. The base case is when there are no more monsters to kill.

State is a tuple of (second, remaining monsters), and the transition relationship involves calculating the minimum mana required to kill the current monster based on its appearance time and health.

Use bottom-up dynamic programming with a 2D table where each cell represents the minimum mana required to kill all monsters up to the given second. Initialize the table with values for the base case (no more monsters).

For each remaining monster, calculate the minimum mana required to kill it at its appearance time by considering the maximum damage achievable in previous seconds and comparing it with the monster's health.

The final answer is the value in the bottom-right cell of the table, which represents the minimum mana required to kill all monsters.
