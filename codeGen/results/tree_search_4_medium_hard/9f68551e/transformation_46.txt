    Iterate through each second from 1 to max(k_i) (where k_i is the appearance time of the i-th monster).
    For each second, calculate the minimum mana required to kill all monsters that appear at or after this second.
    The state represents the maximum damage that can be achieved at each second, considering the current monster's appearance time and health.
    The base case is when there are no more monsters to kill (i.e., there are no remaining monsters).
    State is a tuple of (second, remaining monsters), and the transition relationship involves calculating the minimum mana required to kill the current monster based on its appearance time and health.
    Memoize the recursive function that calculates the minimum mana required to kill all monsters, using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems.
