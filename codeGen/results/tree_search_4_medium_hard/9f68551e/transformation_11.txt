Let's define dp[i][j] as the minimum mana required to kill the first i monsters by time j; The base case is when there are no more monsters to cast spells on.

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum mana required to kill i monsters by time j. Then for each monster, we can either cast a spell at its appearance time or not. If we don't cast a spell, then the state remains the same as before; if we do cast a spell, then we need to recalculate the minimum mana required to kill the remaining monsters by the remaining time.

Let's initialize dp[0][j] = 0 for all j because there are no monsters left to be killed. Then for each monster and its corresponding time k, consider two options: 
1) don't cast a spell at this moment; in that case, we just copy the previous minimum mana required.
2) cast a spell with damage x, where x is either 1 or the minimum mana used so far + 1. In this case, we need to add the current time minus the appearance time of the monster k as additional mana.

To implement memoization, consider using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and reuse them when needed.
The final answer will be dp[n][max(k)], where n is the total number of monsters. We can iterate over all test cases, update the state for each monster's appearance time, and finally return the minimum mana required.

This plan seems correct and includes edge cases. It also takes into account that we need to consider two options for each monster: either cast a spell or not.
