The state could be defined as dp[i][j] representing the minimum total cost to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order, considering only the last string's reversal cost and its position in lexicographical order.

For example, dp[1][0] would represent the minimum total cost to sort only one string, which is 0 because there are no strings to be sorted.
dp[i][j] represents the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings, considering the last string's reversal cost and its position in lexicographical order. This state considers both the substructure (optimal substructure) and overlapping subproblems.

The transition function could be defined as follows:
- If the current string is less than the previous string, then we consider two cases: 
  1. Reversing the current string to make it greater than or equal to the previous string.
  2. Not reversing the current string (i.e., keep its original order).

The minimum total cost in this case would be the sum of the reversal cost of the current string and the minimum total cost to sort the remaining strings.

- If the current string is not less than the previous string, then we consider one case: 
  1. Not reversing the current string (i.e., keep its original order).

The minimum total cost in this case would be the sum of the reversal cost of the previous string and the minimum total cost to sort the remaining strings.

The base case for the transition function could be dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there are no strings to be sorted, so the minimum total cost is 0.

The final answer would be dp[n-1][-1], where n is the number of strings.
