===BEGIN PLAN===
The state could be defined as dp[i][j] representing the minimum total cost to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order, with j being the maximum length of all the strings seen so far. However, this is not enough because we need to consider if a string should be reversed or not.

Let's introduce another dimension k in dp[i][j], where k represents whether the current string (i-1)th string is already in its original form or has been reversed.

So, the state dp[i][k] would represent the minimum total cost to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order, with the (i-1)th string being either in its original form or having been reversed, and j being the maximum length of all the strings seen so far.

We need to consider two cases for each string:

Case 1: The current string is already in its original form. In this case, dp[i][k] = dp[i-1][j]

Case 2: The current string has been reversed. In this case, we need to add the cost of reversing this string to the minimum total cost of sorting the previous strings.

The transition function would be:

dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]
dp[i][1] = min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1]) + (cost of reversing the i-th string)

Finally, we need to return dp[n][max_length]. If it is impossible to sort the strings in lexicographical order, output -1.
