===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has overlapping subproblems: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order can be broken down into solving smaller instances of the same problem, where some solutions are reused across different instances. This property makes bottom-up approach with tabulation suitable for this problem.

Define dp[i][j] as the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order and the last string is the jth string that can be made smaller than any of the previous strings by reversing it.

dp[i][j] is equal to the minimum cost of not reversing the jth string, plus the minimum total cost required to sort the first i-1 strings without considering the jth string. If the jth string is reversed, the new string becomes a prefix of one of the previously sorted strings. In this case, we can consider dp[i-1][k] where k is the last index such that the (i-1)th string and the kth string are the same.

Use a dictionary to store the intermediate results of the dynamic programming problem. The keys for the dictionary would be tuples representing the state (i and j), and the values would be the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order and the last string is the jth string that can be made smaller than any of the previous strings by reversing it.

The base case for the dynamic programming problem would be when i = 1, where we only have one string. In this case, dp[1][j] would be equal to the cost of not reversing the jth string (which is c[j]).

To improve the plan, we can consider using a priority queue instead of a dictionary to store the intermediate results. This could potentially reduce the time complexity of the solution.

One potential issue with the plan is that it might have exponential time complexity due to the use of dynamic programming. To address this, we can consider using memoization or tabulation to store and reuse the intermediate results.

The plan does not include edge cases, but it should be possible to add checks for invalid inputs (e.g., n < 2) at the beginning of the program.
