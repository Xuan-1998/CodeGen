===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has overlapping subproblems: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order can be broken down into solving smaller instances of the same problem, where some solutions are reused across different instances. This property makes bottom-up approach with tabulation suitable for this problem.

Define dp[i][j] as the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order and the last string is the jth string that can be made smaller than any of the previous strings by reversing it.

dp[i][j] is equal to the minimum cost of not reversing the jth string, plus the minimum total cost required to sort the first i-1 strings without considering the jth string. If the jth string is smaller than the (i-1)th string that ends with the same character as the jth string, then we can reverse the jth string and get dp[i][j] = c_j + min(dp[i-1][k]) where k is the index of the last occurrence of this character in the first i-1 strings.

Create a list called dp with n+1 elements, where each element is initialized as infinity, except for the first element which is set to 0. Then fill up the dp table row by row from top to bottom and left to right.
Finally, return dp[n][j] where j is the index of the lexicographically smallest string in the input.
