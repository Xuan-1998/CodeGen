===BEGIN PLAN===
Both optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems exist in the problem: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order has both properties, making it suitable for either top-down approach with memoization or bottom-up approach with tabulation.

Let dp[i][j] denote the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings. Then, dp[i][j] could be defined as min(dp[k][j-1] + c[j-1] + (k==i)) for k from 0 to i, where c is the cost array.

dp[i][j] = 
    if s[i-1] <= s[j-1], 
    else min(
        dp[i-1][len_s-1] + c[len_s-1],
        min(dp[k][j-1] + c[j-1]) for k from 0 to i-1
    )

Apply memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary and using them to avoid redundant calculations.

Sort the strings based on their lengths first, then apply the dynamic programming approach.
If it is impossible to sort the strings in lexicographical order, output -1.
