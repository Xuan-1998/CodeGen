===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order can be decomposed into solving smaller instances of the same problem, with the solution to each instance used as a step towards the solution of the larger instance. This property makes top-down approach with memoization suitable for this problem.

The state is a tuple (i, j) representing the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order up to string j. The transition relationship is defined as dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + c[j] for k from 0 to j-1). This means that to sort the first i strings, we can either sort the first i-1 strings and then reverse the last string to make it lexicographically smaller than any of the previously sorted strings, or we can sort some of the first i-1 strings and then sort the remaining ones along with the jth string.

Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by initializing and filling in the dp table based on the given constraints. Start by initializing the base cases: dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there is no cost to sort an empty set of strings. Then fill in the dp table using the transition relationship.

Finally, return dp[n-1][-1], which represents the minimum total cost required to sort all n strings in lexicographical order. If this value exceeds the given constraints (e.g., it's greater than 10^9), then it is impossible to sort the strings in lexicographical order and we should output -1.
