===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i][j] denote the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings, and let len_s be the length of string s.

Then, dp[i][j] could be defined as:

dp[i][0] = 0 (base case: no strings reversed)
dp[0][j] = ∞ for j > 0 (base case: cannot reverse a non-existent string)

For i > 0 and j > 0, dp[i][j] can be calculated using the following recurrence relation:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j-1] + c[j-1] + (k==i)) for k from 0 to i

This formula calculates the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings by considering all possible positions k at which we can reverse the jth string.

The goal is to find the value of dp[n][n], where n is the number of strings, which represents the minimum total cost required to sort all the strings in lexicographical order.

To improve the plan, we can use a priority queue to select the optimal k at each step, rather than considering all possible positions k.

One potential issue with the plan is that it may be inefficient for large inputs, as it requires O(n^2) time complexity. To mitigate this issue, we can consider using a more efficient algorithm or data structure.

The plan includes edge cases by handling the base cases correctly. For example, dp[i][0] = 0 and dp[0][j] = ∞ for j > 0 ensure that the minimum total cost is calculated correctly even when there are no strings to reverse.
