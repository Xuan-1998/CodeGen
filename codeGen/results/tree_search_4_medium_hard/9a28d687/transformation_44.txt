===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can define our state as dp[i][j] representing the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order with a maximum length of j characters.

dp[0][j] = 0, since there are no strings to be sorted.
For any i > 0, we have two options: either the last string is not reversed (cost = 0), or it is reversed (cost = c_i). In the latter case, we need to ensure that all previous strings are also reversed.

Let's denote the minimum total cost required to sort the first i-1 strings in lexicographical order with a maximum length of j characters as dp[i-1][j]. If the last string is not reversed (cost = 0), then the minimum total cost is simply dp[i-1][j].
If the last string is reversed (cost = c_i), we need to ensure that all previous strings are also reversed, which would add a cost of dp[i-1][min(j, len(s_i))]. The reason we use min(j, len(s_i))) is because if the maximum length of j characters is exceeded by the last string, then we only need to reverse up to the minimum of j and len(s_i).

So, the state equation becomes: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], c_i + dp[i-1][min(j, len(s_i))]).

We can use this recurrence relation to build a 2D array where dp[i][j] is the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order with a maximum length of j characters. The answer would be dp[n][max_len], where max_len is the maximum length of all the strings.
