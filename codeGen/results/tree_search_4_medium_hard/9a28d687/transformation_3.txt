===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order can be decomposed into solving smaller instances of the same problem, with the solution to each instance used as a step towards the solution of the larger instance. This property makes top-down approach with memoization suitable for this problem.

The state is an integer i representing the number of strings sorted so far, and the base case is when i == n
To define a DP array dp where each entry dp[i] represents the minimum total cost to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order, with the initial condition being dp[0] = 0

Use bottom-up tabulation by initializing a dynamic programming array of size n+1 and filling it up from left to right as follows:
    - Initialize dp[0] = 0
    - For each string cost c and its corresponding string s:
        + If the first i-1 strings are already sorted, then consider the current string s. 
          - If the current string is less than all previously sorted strings (i.e., it can be inserted anywhere), then dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-1] + c)
          - If the current string is greater than or equal to the first string in the already sorted sequence, then try reversing s and consider inserting it at the beginning of the sorted sequence. 
            + In this case, dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[0] + i*c)
        + Update dp[i]
    - The final answer is dp[n]

This plan takes into account edge cases where the total cost required to sort strings in lexicographical order can be minimized.
