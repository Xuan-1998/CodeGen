===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order can be decomposed into solving smaller instances of the same problem, with the solution to each instance used as a step towards the solution of the larger instance. This property makes top-down approach with memoization suitable for this problem.

A pair (k, c) representing the k-th string's cost to reverse and its current reversed or original status

Formulate the state as a tuple (i, s, t) where i is the index of the current string, s is the lexicographical order of the strings seen so far, and t is the total cost to reach this state. This allows us to store the minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order from any given state.

Use a hash map to store the lexicographical order of the strings as keys and their corresponding minimum total costs as values, and update the memoization table accordingly.

To improve the plan, consider maintaining two separate hash maps: one for storing the minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order from any given state, and another for storing the optimal action (reverse or not) to reach that state. This allows us to efficiently look up the minimum total cost and the optimal action for a given state.

The plan appears to account for edge cases such as when it is impossible to sort the strings in lexicographical order.
