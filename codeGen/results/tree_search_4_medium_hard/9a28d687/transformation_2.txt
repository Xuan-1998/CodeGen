===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order can be decomposed into solving smaller instances of the same problem, with the solution to each instance used as a step towards the solution of the larger instance. This property makes top-down approach with memoization suitable for this problem.

The state is a tuple (i, j) representing the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order up to string j.

The transition relationship is defined as follows: 
For each string s_j from 0 to j-1, if s_j is smaller than or equal to s_j+1 (lexicographically), then dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + c[j] for k from 0 to j-1) where k is the largest index such that s_k is smaller than or equal to s_j.
If no string s_j is found to be smaller than or equal to s_j+1, then dp[i][j] = -1 indicating it's impossible to sort the strings in lexicographical order.

Create a memoized dictionary where keys are tuples (i, j) and values are the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order up to string j. Initialize the base case as dp[0][j] = c[j] for 0 <= j < n.

Finally, return dp[n-1][n-1].
