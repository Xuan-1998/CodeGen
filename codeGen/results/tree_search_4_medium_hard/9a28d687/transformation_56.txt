===BEGIN PLAN===
The state could be defined as dp[i][j] representing the minimum total cost to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order, considering only the first j characters of each string.
dp[i][j] is the minimum total cost of sorting the first i-1 strings plus the minimum total cost to sort the last string's suffix, considering only its own length and cost, up to a maximum of j characters.
Create an array dp[][] of size n+1 by n+1 and initialize it with a special value like -1, then iterate through all possible lengths from 1 to m (where m is the maximum length of any string) and for each length update the minimum total cost using dynamic programming. The key is that we can only reverse strings up to their own length, so this approach considers this constraint.
Finally, return dp[n][m] as the minimum total cost required to sort all n strings in lexicographical order.
