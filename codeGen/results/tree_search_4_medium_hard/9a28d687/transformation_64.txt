===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can define dp[i][j] as the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings and reverse at most j-1 strings. Then, dp[i][j] could be defined as min(dp[k][j-1] + c[j-1] + (k==i)) for k from 0 to i.

Let len_s be the length of string s. Then, dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j-1] + c[j-1] + (k==i) + |s[j-1]| - |s[k-1]|) for k from 0 to i, where c is the cost array.

Applying dynamic programming with memoization by defining a recursive function that returns the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings, considering all possible ways to reverse the strings up to the current position. The base case would be dp[0][j] = 0 for j from 1 to n, since we need to reverse no strings to get an empty list of strings.

We can use a 2D array dp with size (n+1) x (n+1) to store the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings and reverse at most j-1 strings. The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the number of strings, since we need to consider all possible ways to reverse the strings.

The space complexity is also O(n^2), since we need a 2D array to store the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings and reverse at most j-1 strings. The updated version of the entire detailed plan only is as follows:
