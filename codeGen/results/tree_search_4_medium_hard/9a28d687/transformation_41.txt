===BEGIN PLAN===
Both optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems exist in the problem. The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order has both properties, making it suitable for either top-down approach with memoization or bottom-up approach with tabulation.

The state could be defined as dp[i][j] representing the minimum total cost to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order, with j being the maximum length of all the strings seen so far. dp[i][j] is true if it's possible to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order with a maximum length of j characters, otherwise false.

Create a function f that takes an integer n as input, initializes a 2D table dp with size (n+1) x max_len, and fills it using a loop. For each string s_i, check if reversing it reduces the maximum length seen so far. If yes, update the maximum length and fill the corresponding cell in the dp table.

Fill the base cases for strings of length 0 or 1, then iterate over the strings, updating the dp table accordingly.

The function f should return the minimum total cost to sort all strings in lexicographical order if it's possible, otherwise -1. This would be equivalent to finding the cell dp[n][max_len] that represents the minimum total cost.
