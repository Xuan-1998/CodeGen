===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure property holds because the problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems: sorting the first i-1 strings and then sorting the last string's suffix.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach. The state could be defined as dp[i] representing the minimum total cost to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order, without considering any lengths.

The transition function for the dynamic programming is as follows:

dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + c_k + (k == 0 ? 0 : l_k)) for j from 1 to i

where dp[0] is initialized to 0. This represents the minimum total cost of sorting the first i-1 strings plus the minimum total cost to sort the last string's suffix, considering only its own length and cost.

To avoid redundant computations, we can use a dictionary memo to store the results of subproblems, where memo[i] stores the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order.

The final answer is dp[n], which represents the minimum total cost required to sort all n strings in lexicographical order.
