===BEGIN PLAN===
Both optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems exist in the problem: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order has both properties, making it suitable for either top-down approach with memoization or bottom-up approach with tabulation.

Let dp[i][j] denote the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings, and let len_s be the length of string s. Then, 
dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j-1] + c[j-1]) for k from 0 to i
where c is the cost array, if the jth string is not reversed.
For the case where the jth string is reversed, we have:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][len_s-j] + c[len_s-j]) for k from 0 to i

To handle edge cases, initialize dp[0][j] = 0 and dp[i][0] = sum of costs up to the ith string. The final answer is dp[n-1][-1], where n is the number of strings.
