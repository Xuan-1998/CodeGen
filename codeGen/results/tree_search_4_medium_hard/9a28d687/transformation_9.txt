===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order can be decomposed into solving smaller instances of the same problem, with the solution to each instance used as a step towards the solution of the larger instance. This property makes top-down approach with memoization suitable for this problem.

A pair (k, c) representing the k-th string's cost to reverse and its current reversed or original status
Consider the state as a tuple (i, rev) where i is the index of the current string and rev is a boolean indicating whether the string has been reversed or not.

Memoize a recursive function that computes the minimum cost to sort the strings in lexicographical order, using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems. 

For each string, consider two options: 
- Reverse the string (if it's not already reversed), and recursively call the function on the remaining strings with all their reversed or original statuses updated accordingly.
- Keep the string as is (i.e., don't reverse it), and recursively call the function on the remaining strings.

The base case for the recursion should be when there are no more strings to process. 

To determine whether the current string can be placed in its optimal position, compare it with all previously processed strings that have not been reversed yet. If the current string is smaller than any of them (lexicographically), then place it at the beginning; otherwise, if it's larger, place it at the end.
