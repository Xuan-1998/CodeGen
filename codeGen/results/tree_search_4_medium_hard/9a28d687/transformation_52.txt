===BEGIN PLAN===
Both optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems exist in the problem: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order has both properties, making it suitable for either top-down approach with memoization or bottom-up approach with tabulation.

The state could be defined as dp[i] representing the minimum total cost to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order, without considering any lengths. This is a correct representation of the problem's substructure.

dp[i] is the minimum total cost of sorting the first i-1 strings plus the reversal cost of the i-th string if it's in correct position, or -1 otherwise. This definition captures the optimal substructure and the overlapping subproblems correctly.

Implementing memoization by defining a recursive function with a memo dictionary to store and reuse intermediate results is a good approach. However, we should consider the base case when i is 0 or 1 to handle edge cases properly.

In addition, we need to ensure that the sorting of strings is done in lexicographical order. This can be achieved by comparing each string with the previous one and determining the minimum cost required to put it in correct position.

Finally, we should also consider the case when it's impossible to sort the strings in lexicographical order, which would return -1 as per the problem statement.
