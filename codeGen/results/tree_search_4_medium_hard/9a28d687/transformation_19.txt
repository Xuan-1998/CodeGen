===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has overlapping subproblems: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order can be broken down into solving smaller instances of the same problem, where some solutions are reused across different instances. This property makes bottom-up approach with tabulation suitable for this problem.

The state expression can be a 3D array dp where dp[i][j][k] represents the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order using at most j reversals and considering the last k characters of the current string. This is because we need to consider the last character of the current string when deciding whether to reverse it or not.

State: dp[i][j][k] represents the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order using at most j reversals and considering the last k characters of the current string, where i = 0..n-1, j = 0..max_cost, and k = 0..m for some constant m.

Initialize dp[0][j][k] for all j = 0..max_cost and k = 0..m, and set it to be the minimum cost required to sort an empty list of strings using at most j reversals and considering the last k characters. This value can be either 0 or -1, depending on whether it's possible to sort an empty list of strings.

Transition function:
If the current string is in lexicographical order with respect to the previously sorted strings (i.e., its first k-1 characters are equal to the last k-1 characters of one of the previously sorted strings), then we can simply append this string to the sorted list and update dp[i+1][j][k] accordingly.

Otherwise, we need to decide whether to reverse the current string or not. If we choose to reverse it, then we add its cost to the minimum total cost required to sort the remaining strings using at most j-1 reversals (i.e., dp[i][j-1][k-1]) and update dp[i+1][j][k] accordingly.

If we choose not to reverse it, then we simply append this string to the sorted list and update dp[i+1][j][k] accordingly.

Finally, output dp[n-1][max_cost][m], which represents the minimum total cost required to sort all strings in lexicographical order using at most max_cost reversals.
