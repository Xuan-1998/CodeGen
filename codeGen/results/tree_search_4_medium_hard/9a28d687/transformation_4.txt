===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order can be decomposed into solving smaller instances of the same problem, with the solution to each instance used as a step towards the solution of the larger instance. This property makes top-down approach with memoization suitable for this problem.

The state is an integer i representing the number of strings sorted so far, and the base case is when i == n

To define a DP array dp where each entry dp[i] represents the minimum total cost to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order, with the initial condition being dp[0] = 0

Use top-down memoization with recursion, storing the results in a dictionary to avoid redundant computation. When considering the next string, we can either add it as is or reverse it (depending on its cost). We choose the option that minimizes the total cost.

We also need to consider edge cases: when i == n, dp[i] = 0; when i < n and all strings are already sorted in lexicographical order, dp[i] = sum of costs of reversing each string from i+1 to n

The plan can be improved by considering the idea that we only need to store the results for strings that have been fully processed (i.e., their costs are included in the total cost), and not storing intermediate results.
