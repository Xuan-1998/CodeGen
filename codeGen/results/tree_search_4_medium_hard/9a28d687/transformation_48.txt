===BEGIN PLAN===
Both optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems exist in the problem: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order has both properties, making it suitable for either top-down approach with memoization or bottom-up approach with tabulation.

The state could be defined as dp[i][j] representing the minimum total cost to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order, considering only the last string's reversal cost and its position in lexicographical order. 

Create a 2D table dp[][] with n rows, representing the number of strings, and j columns, where j is the maximum length of any string. Each cell dp[i][j] stores the minimum total cost to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order, considering only the last string's reversal cost and its position in lexicographical order.

For each cell dp[i][j], consider all possible ways to sort the first i-1 strings and then append a string of length j. The optimal approach would be to choose the string that results in the minimum total cost when appended.

To determine the minimum total cost for a given cell, iterate through all strings and calculate their reversal costs if they were appended at this position. Choose the one with the minimum cost.

dp[0][j] = 0 (base case), as there are no strings to sort initially.

dp[i][0] = -1 (base case), as it is impossible to append a string of length 0 and still have a sorted sequence.

The final answer would be dp[n][max_length], where max_length is the maximum length of any string.
