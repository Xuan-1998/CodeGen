===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure property exists because the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order can be obtained by finding the minimum total cost for the first i-1 strings and then adding the minimum cost to sort the i-th string given that it must be greater than or equal to all previously sorted strings.

The overlapping subproblems property exists because when calculating dp[i][j], we might have already calculated dp[k][j] for k < i. This is because the maximum length of all the strings seen so far (j) does not change when moving from string i-1 to string i, but the minimum total cost can decrease.

The state could be defined as dp[i][j] representing the minimum total cost to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order, with j being the maximum length of all the strings seen so far. This is because the optimal solution for sorting the first i strings might involve reversing some characters in previous strings, and we need to consider this when calculating dp[i][j].

To implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach using a 2D table to store the minimum total cost for each subproblem, we can start from the base case where i = 1, then fill up the 2D table row by row.
