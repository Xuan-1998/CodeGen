===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has overlapping subproblems: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order can be broken down into solving smaller instances of the same problem, where some solutions are reused across different instances. This property makes bottom-up approach with tabulation suitable for this problem.

The state expression can be a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order using at most j reversals.
State: dp[i][0] = c[0], where c is the cost array. This is because we need to start with the first string and reverse it or not, depending on whether it's already in its final position.

Then, for each i from 1 to n-1:
    - Initialize dp[i][0] as the minimum total cost required to sort the first i-1 strings using at most 0 reversals.
    - For j from 0 to l (where l is the number of reversals needed to put the current string in its final position):
        + If j > 0, then dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + c[i]) for k from 0 to j. This represents the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings using at most j reversals.
        + If j == 0, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][0]. This is because we don't need any reversals if the current string is in its final position.

The final answer will be dp[n-1][l], where l is the number of reversals needed to put all strings in their final positions.
