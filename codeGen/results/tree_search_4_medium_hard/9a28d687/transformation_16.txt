===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order can be decomposed into solving smaller instances of the same problem, with the solution to each instance used as a step towards the solution of the larger instance. This property makes top-down approach with memoization suitable for this problem.

A pair (k, c) representing the k-th string's cost to reverse and its current reversed or original status

The state can be represented by a tuple (i, prev_str, rev) where i is the index of the current string, prev_str is the previously sorted string, and rev is a boolean indicating whether the string has been reversed or not.

To further improve this plan, we should consider the base case. For example, when there's only one string left to sort, the minimum total cost would be 0 if the string is already in lexicographical order, or the cost of reversing it otherwise.

A potential issue with the plan is that it doesn't consider the edge case where two strings are equal and the problem asks for a minimal total cost. In this case, we should add an additional check to ensure that the current string is not added to the sorted list if the previous string has the same lexicographical order.

To address this issue, we can modify the plan as follows:
