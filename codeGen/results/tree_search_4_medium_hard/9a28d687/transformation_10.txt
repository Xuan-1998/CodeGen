===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order can be decomposed into solving smaller instances of the same problem, with the solution to each instance used as a step towards the solution of the larger instance. This property makes top-down approach with memoization suitable for this problem.

Consider the state as a tuple (i, rev) where i is the index of the current string and rev is a boolean indicating whether the string has been reversed or not.

Use dynamic programming by defining a 2D table dp[i][j] where i is the number of strings and j is 0 or 1 indicating whether the string at index i has been reversed or not, and fill it in a bottom-up manner. Specifically:

- Initialize dp[0][0] = 0 because there are no strings to sort.
- For each i from 1 to n:
    * If the current string is lexicographically smaller than the previous string (or if this is the first string), then consider two options:
        + Option 1: Reverse the current string and set dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][0] + c_i, where c_i is the cost to reverse the i-th string.
        + Option 2: Don't reverse the current string and set dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][1].
    * If the current string is lexicographically larger than or equal to the previous string (or if this is the first string), then only consider reversing the current string:
        + Set dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][1] + c_i.
    * Update the minimum cost for each possible state: dp[i][0] = min(dp[i][0], dp[i][1]), and similarly for dp[i][1].
- The answer is the minimum total cost required to sort all strings, which can be found as dp[n][0].
