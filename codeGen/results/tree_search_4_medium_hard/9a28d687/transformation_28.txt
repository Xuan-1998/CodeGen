===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has overlapping subproblems: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order can be broken down into solving smaller instances of the same problem, where some solutions are reused across different instances. This property makes bottom-up approach with tabulation suitable for this problem.

Define dp[i][j] as the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order and the last string is the jth string that can be made smaller than any of the previous strings by reversing it.

Use memoization with dictionary to store the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order and the last string is the jth string that can be made smaller than any of the previous strings by reversing it.

For each query, iterate through all possible prefix lengths for the current string. For each prefix length, check if the current string can be made smaller than any of the previous strings by reversing its remaining part. If yes, calculate the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order and store it in dp[i][j]. If not, return -1.

Use binary search to find the correct prefix length for the current string.

Update the plan as follows:
