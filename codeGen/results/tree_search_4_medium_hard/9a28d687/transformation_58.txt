===BEGIN PLAN===
The initial plan is correct in recognizing that the problem has both optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, making it suitable for either top-down approach with memoization or bottom-up approach with tabulation.

Let dp[i][j] denote the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings, and let len_s be the length of string s. Then, dp[i][j] could be defined as:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j-1] + c[j-1] + (k==i)) for k from 0 to i

This recursive function takes string indices as arguments and uses memoization.

To improve the plan, we can consider using a more efficient data structure than a two-dimensional array. Since we are only concerned with the cost of reversing strings, we can reduce the dimensionality by considering dp[i] instead of dp[i][j]. This would make the dynamic programming approach more efficient.

The initial plan does not include edge cases, so it's important to consider these cases when implementing the solution. For example, what if n is 0? What if all strings are the same?

Here's an updated version of the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i] denote the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings.

Then, dp[i] = min(dp[k] + c[len_s-1-k] + (k==i)) for k from 0 to i

Use memoization with a recursive function that takes string indices as arguments. This approach can be improved by using a more efficient data structure than a one-dimensional array.

Consider edge cases, such as what if n is 0? What if all strings are the same?
===END PLAN===
