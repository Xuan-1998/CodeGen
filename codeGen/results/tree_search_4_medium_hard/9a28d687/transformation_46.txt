===BEGIN PLAN===
The state could be defined as dp[i][j] representing the minimum total cost to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order, with j being the maximum length of all the strings seen so far.

dp[i][j] represents the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed from the first i strings if we reverse at most j characters, and its cost. We will use top-down dynamic programming with memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computation.

To fill up the dp table, for each pair (i, j), we need to find the minimum total cost to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order if we are allowed to reverse at most j characters. We can do this by iterating through all strings from 1 to i, and for each string k, check if its length is less than or equal to j, then update dp[i][j] with min(dp[i][j], dp[k-1][str_len(k)-1]+c[k]) where str_len(k) is the length of string k and c[k] is the cost to reverse string k.

To handle edge cases, we need to make sure that dp[0][0] is initialized as 0 (base case), because there are no strings to sort. Also, when i > j, it means all strings have been processed and the remaining characters in each string don't matter for sorting, so dp[i][j] should be updated as min(dp[k-1][j]+c[k]) where k is the maximum length of all strings.

Finally, after filling up the dp table, we can return dp[n][max_j] as the minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order. If it is impossible to sort the strings in lexicographical order (i.e., dp[n][max_j] equals to -1), output -1.
