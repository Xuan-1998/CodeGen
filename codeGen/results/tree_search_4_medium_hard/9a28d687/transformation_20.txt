===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has overlapping subproblems: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order can be broken down into solving smaller instances of the same problem, where some solutions are reused across different instances. This property makes bottom-up approach with tabulation suitable for this problem.

The state expression can be a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order using at most j reversals.

State: dp[i][j] represents the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order using at most j reversals, where i = 0..n-1 and j = 0..k for some constant k.

Create a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (max_cost+1), where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order using at most j reversals.

Initialize all cells in dp to be infinity except for dp[0][0], which is 0, representing no cost for sorting an empty set of strings.

For every string s[i] with a reversal cost c_i, consider two options:
1. Reverse the entire string: This increases the total cost by c_i and reduces the problem size by 1.
2. Don't reverse the string yet: This keeps the current problem size but increases the maximum number of reversals needed to sort the strings.

For each i, iterate over all possible j (from 0 to max_cost) and consider both options above. For each option, update dp[i+1][j+c_i] to be the minimum of its current value and the sum of:
- The cost of reversing the string s[i] (c_i)
- The cost of sorting the first i strings in lexicographical order using at most j-c_i reversals (dp[i][j-c_i])

The final answer is dp[n][max_cost], which represents the minimum total cost required to sort all n strings in lexicographical order.
