===BEGIN PLAN===
dp = {}

state dp[(i, s)] represents the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order, considering only the last string's reversal cost and its position in lexicographical order. Initialize it with infinity.

for n strings:
  for each string from 1 to n:
    if the current string is equal to the previous one: dp[(i, s)] = dp[(i-1, p)] (no extra cost)
    else: 
      for all possible prefixes of the current string that are present in the previous strings:
        calculate the minimum total cost required to sort these strings with the prefix removed
        add the reversal cost of the current string and the position of the current string in lexicographical order
        update dp[(i, s)] if this is less than its current value

return dp[(n, s)]
