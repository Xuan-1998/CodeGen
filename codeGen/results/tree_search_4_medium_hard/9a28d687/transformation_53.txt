===BEGIN PLAN===
Both optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems exist in the problem: 
The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order has both properties, making it suitable for either top-down approach with memoization or bottom-up approach with tabulation. 

The state could be defined as dp[i] representing the minimum total cost to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order, without considering any lengths.

dp[i] is the minimum total cost of sorting the first i-1 strings plus the reversal cost of the i-th string if it's in correct position, or -1 otherwise. 

The base case could be defined as dp[0] = 0 (since we don't need to reverse anything for an empty array).

We can initialize a memoization dictionary dp with default value -1 to store the minimum total cost for each subproblem.

Then we can solve the problem by recursively considering all possible ways to sort the strings:

- If the first i-1 strings are already sorted (dp[i-1] != -1), then we only need to consider the reversal cost of the i-th string if it's in correct position.
- Otherwise, we need to consider all possible positions for the i-th string and add its reversal cost to the minimum total cost of sorting the first i-1 strings.

Finally, we can return dp[n] as the minimum total cost required to sort all n strings.

This plan is correct and should work efficiently with memoization. It includes edge cases (empty array) and considers all possible ways to sort the strings.
