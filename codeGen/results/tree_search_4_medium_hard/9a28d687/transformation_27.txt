===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has overlapping subproblems: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order can be broken down into solving smaller instances of the same problem, where some solutions are reused across different instances. This property makes bottom-up approach with tabulation suitable for this problem.

Define dp[i][j] as the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order and the last string is the jth string that can be made smaller than any of the previous strings by reversing it.
dp[i][j] represents the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order and the last string is the jth string that can be made smaller than any of the previous strings by reversing it.

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order and the last string is the jth string that can be made smaller than any of the previous strings by reversing it.
For each string s, calculate its reverse r, and find the position p such that all strings before p are smaller than or equal to s, and all strings after p are greater than s. Then, update dp[i][j] as follows:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][p-1] + cost[k]+cost[r]) for k from 0 to i-1

This plan is correct. It correctly identifies the dynamic programming approach suitable for this problem.
