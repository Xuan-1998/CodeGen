===BEGIN PLAN===
Both optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems exist in the problem: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order has both properties, making it suitable for either top-down approach with memoization or bottom-up approach with tabulation.

Let dp[i][j] denote the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings, and let len_s be the length of string s. Then, dp[i][j] could be defined as min(dp[k][j-1] + c[j-1] + (k==i)) for k from 0 to i, where c is the cost array.

The base case would be when all strings are sorted in lexicographical order, which means dp[n][len_s-1] would store the minimum total cost required. This could be calculated as sum(c) because no more operations are needed.

For the recursive case, consider two possibilities: s[i-1] <= s[j-1], and s[i-1] > s[j-1]. If s[i-1] <= s[j-1], then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]. Otherwise, dp[i][j] could be min(dp[i-1][len_s-1] + c[len_s-1], dp[k][j-1] + c[j-1]) for k from 0 to i-1. This is because we have two options: either reverse the current string (dp[i-1][len_s-1] + c[len_s-1]), or continue with the previous string and try to sort the rest of strings in lexicographical order.

Using dynamic programming with a 2D table to store the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings and the last j characters of string s
