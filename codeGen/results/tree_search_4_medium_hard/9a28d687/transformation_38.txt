===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has overlapping subproblems: The minimum total cost required to sort the strings in lexicographical order can be broken down into solving smaller instances of the same problem, where some solutions are reused across different instances. This property makes bottom-up approach with tabulation suitable for this problem.

The state expression can be a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings in lexicographical order, considering only the first j characters of each string.

State: A 3D array dp[n][m][2] where n is the number of strings and m is the length of each string. The third dimension represents the orientation (0 for ascending or 1 for descending) of the string at a given position. This state will be updated based on the previously computed states.

Transition function: For each i, j, dp[i][j] can be calculated by considering all possible orientations (0 or 1) for the first j characters of the ith string. The minimum cost is achieved when the string is sorted in ascending order if it starts with a smaller character than the previous strings, and descending otherwise.

Base case: dp[0][m] = 0, since there are no strings to sort initially.

Dynamic programming equations:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + (j-k) * c, dp[i-1][k] + k * c) for 0 <= k < j
where c is the cost of reversing a string

The minimum total cost required to sort all strings in lexicographical order is dp[n][m]
