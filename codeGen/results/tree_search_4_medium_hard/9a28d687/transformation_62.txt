dp[i][j] = 0 if i == 0
Let dp[i][j] denote the minimum total cost required to sort the first i strings, and let len_s be the length of string s. Then, 
dp[i][j] could be defined as min(dp[k][j-1] + c[j-1]) for k from 0 to i, where c is the cost array.
if j > 0:
    if s[i-1] <= s[j-1]:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
    else:
        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][len_s-1] + c[len_s-1], 
                       min((dp[k][j-1] + c[j-1]) for k in range(i)))
Initialize a 2D table dp with n+1 rows and len_s+1 columns, fill it in from top-down
fill the first row as follows: dp[0][k] = 0 if k == 0 else c[k-1]
for i in range(1, n+1):
    for j in range(len_s):
        if s[i-1] <= s[j]:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
        else:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][len_s-1] + c[len_s-1], 
                           min((dp[k][j] + c[j]) for k in range(i)))
Output dp[n][len_s-1]
