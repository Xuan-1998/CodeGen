===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n.

The base case is when i = n (end vertex), in which case we return 1 because we can always visit the end vertex itself.

Use dynamic programming to build up a table dp where dp[i][t] represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within t time units starting from vertex i. The state transition function should consider all edges that start at vertex i and have a weight less than or equal to t, updating the dp value accordingly.

Implement memoization using a dictionary called memo to store intermediate results, where memo[(i, t)] represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within t time units starting from vertex i. This will help avoid redundant computation and improve efficiency.

To find the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex n, iterate through all vertices in reverse order (from n to 1) and update the dp value based on the memoized results. Finally, return the maximum value found during this iteration.
