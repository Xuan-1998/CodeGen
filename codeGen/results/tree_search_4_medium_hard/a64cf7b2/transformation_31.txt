===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n.

The base case is when i = n (end vertex), in which case we return 1 because we can always visit the end vertex itself.

The state is the current vertex i, and the transition relationship is the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the remaining time limit, considering all edges that start at vertex i, along with a dynamic programming table that stores the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the remaining time limit for each subproblem.

Use a 2D array dp to store the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the remaining time limit for each subproblem, with dimensions (n+1) by (T+1).

Initialize dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, because we cannot visit any vertices with 0 time left.

For i from 1 to n:
    For t from T downto 1:
        If there is an edge from vertex i-1 to vertex i with weight w and remaining time limit t >= w:
            dp[i][t] = max(dp[i][t], dp[i-1][t-w]+1)
        Else:
            dp[i][t] = dp[i-1][t]

Return dp[n][T]
