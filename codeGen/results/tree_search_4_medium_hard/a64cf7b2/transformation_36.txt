===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n.

The base case is when i = 1 (start vertex), not n (end vertex). In this case, we return 0 because we cannot visit any vertices yet. The dynamic programming state is dp[i], which represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the time limit, considering all edges that start at vertex i.

The transition relationship is calculated as follows:
- If there are no edges starting at vertex i, then the maximum number of vertices that can be visited is 0.
- Otherwise, consider each edge (u, v, t) starting at vertex i. For each edge, calculate the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the remaining time limit if we traverse this edge and visit all its downstream vertices. The maximum number of vertices that can be visited considering this edge is max(0, dp[v] - t). Add up the maximum numbers of vertices that can be visited considering each edge starting at vertex i, and take the maximum.

The dynamic programming algorithm starts by initializing the base case dp[1] = 0. Then it iterates from i = n to i = 1, updating dp[i] based on the transition relationship.

Implement a function to recursively calculate the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, using memoization to store the results of subproblems.
