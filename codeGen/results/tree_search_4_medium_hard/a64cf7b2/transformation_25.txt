===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n.

dp[i][t]: maximum number of vertices that can be visited within t time units, considering only edges with weight less than or equal to t. The state transition function is:
- If there are no outgoing edges from vertex i, then dp[i][t] = max(dp[j][t-w] for all j in the previous level) + 1
- If there is at least one outgoing edge from vertex i with weight w, then dp[i][t] = 1 + max(dp[j][min(t-w, t)] for all j in the previous level)

Create a 2D table dp where dp[i][t] represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within t time units, considering only edges with weight less than or equal to t.

The final answer is the value of dp[n][T]
