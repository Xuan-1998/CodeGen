===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming to solve this problem by iteratively constructing the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex n within a time limit of T.

Define the state expression as (i, t), where i is the current vertex and t is the time spent so far to traverse from vertex 1 to vertex i.
The base case is when i == n, in which case the maximum number of vertices that can be visited is 1. For other cases, define a dynamic programming function dp(i, t) as follows:

- If i == 0 or t > T, return 0
- Otherwise, consider all possible edges from vertex 1 to vertex i and choose the one with the minimum weight w such that (i - 1, t - w) is feasible (i.e., dp(i - 1, t - w) >= 1). If no such edge exists, return 0.
- Return 1 + dp(i - 1, t - w)

Define a function to construct the optimal route by backtracking from vertex n to vertex 1 using the dynamic programming values.
