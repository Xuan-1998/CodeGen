===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation to build up a table dp of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n.

The base case is when i = n (end vertex), in which case we return 1 because we can always visit the end vertex itself.

Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n. The state is the current vertex i, and the transition relationship is the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the remaining time limit, considering all edges that start at vertex i.

Use a separate table edges to store information about each edge, such as its start and end vertices, and the time required to traverse it. Let's denote this by dp[i].

Let's iterate over all edges (u, v, t) in descending order of their weights. For each edge, update dp[v] = max(dp[v], dp[u] - t).

Finally, return dp[1]. This will give us the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex n within a time limit of T.

The correctness of this plan relies on the fact that we are considering all possible paths and edges. The edge case where there is no path from vertex 1 to vertex n has already been guaranteed in the problem statement, so we don't need to worry about it explicitly.
