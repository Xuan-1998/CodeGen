===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n.

Consider the state as dp[i][t]: maximum number of vertices that can be visited within t time units, considering only edges with weight less than or equal to t, and ending at vertex i (starting from vertex 1).

To fill up the table, iterate over each edge in non-decreasing order of its weight. For each edge (u, v, w) such that dp[v][t-w] is already calculated, update dp[u][t] with the maximum value between its current value and dp[v][t-w]+1.

Implementing memoization using a dictionary where each key is a subproblem state (i, t) and its value is the result of solving that subproblem. This ensures that no subproblem is solved more than once, reducing the overall time complexity.

Finally, return the maximum value in dp[1][T] as the answer, which represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within T time units starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex n.
