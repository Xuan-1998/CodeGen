===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming (DP) to solve this problem by building up a 2D table dp[i][v] that represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within time limit T, starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex i, and considering only edges with weight less than or equal to v.

Define the state expression as (i, v), where i is the current vertex and v is the remaining time. The base case is when i == n, in which case the maximum number of vertices that can be visited is v + 1.

Formulate state and transition relationships:
- For each edge (u, v) with weight t:
    - If t <= v, update dp[i][v] as the maximum of two cases: 
        • Recursively exploring all possible routes from vertex u to vertex i within time limit T - t
        • Not visiting vertex i and staying at vertex u
    - Otherwise (t > v), ignore this edge since it exceeds the remaining time

Implement a hybrid approach combining bottom-up DP with memoization to store the results in a dictionary, allowing for efficient retrieval and updating of intermediate values during the recursive process.
