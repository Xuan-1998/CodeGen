===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation and memoization to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from vertex n.

The base case is when t = 0, in which case we return 1 because we can visit the start vertex (1) within 0 time units. The end condition should be updated to handle this case correctly.

State: dp[i][t] represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited from vertex i to the end vertex n within t time units, considering all possible edges and edges with non-negative weights.

Memoization using a dictionary is necessary to store previously computed values and avoid redundant calculations. This ensures that subproblems are solved only once and their solutions are reused when needed.

When computing dp[i][t], consider iterating over all outgoing edges from vertex i, update the maximum number of vertices that can be visited if the time required to traverse the edge plus the number of vertices visited so far is less than or equal to t. This simulates the process of visiting vertices and updating the maximum count.

The final answer is the value stored in dp[1][T], which represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited from vertex 1 to the end vertex n within T time units, considering all possible edges and edges with non-negative weights.
