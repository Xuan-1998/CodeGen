===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n.

The base case is when t = 0, in which case we return 0 because we cannot visit any vertices within 0 time units.

State: dp[i][t] represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited from vertex i to the end vertex n within t time units, considering all possible edges.

Use a 2D array with dimensions (n+1) by (T+1), where:

* For each vertex i from n to 1:
	+ Initialize dp[i][0] = 0, as we cannot visit any vertices within 0 time units.
	+ For each edge (u, v, t) from u to v with weight t:
		- If the edge can be traversed within t time units and v is reachable from i, update dp[v][t - t] = max(dp[v][t - t], dp[i][t] + 1)
* Return dp[1][T]

This plan should correctly solve the problem. It uses a dynamic programming approach to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n.
