===BEGIN PLAN===
Design a recursive function that explores all possible routes from vertex 1 to vertex n, and uses memoization to store the results in a dictionary.

Define the state as a tuple (t, path), representing the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within a time limit of t by following the edge sequence in path. This state expression allows us to capture the information about both the remaining time and the current path taken.

State: (t, path)

Use memoization by defining a dictionary dp where dp[(t, path)] represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within a time limit of t by following the edge sequence in path. Then, use this dictionary to store the results of subproblems as you solve them.

When exploring a subproblem, calculate the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the remaining time by considering all possible edges from the current vertex and recursively exploring the resulting subproblems.

To avoid redundant calculations, check if the subproblem has already been solved and store its result in the dp dictionary. If the result is not stored, solve the subproblem and store its result before moving on to the next step.

Finally, construct the optimal route by tracing back from vertex n to vertex 1 based on the stored values of the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within a time limit of t for each edge in the optimal path.
