===BEGIN PLAN===
Design a recursive function that explores all possible routes from vertex 1 to vertex n, and uses memoization to store the results in a dictionary.

Define the state as a tuple (t, path), representing the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within a time limit of t by following the edge sequence in path.
State expression: dp[(t, path)], which represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within a time limit of t and following the edge sequence in path.

To utilize memoization in a recursive function by passing the current state and previous results as arguments to the function, allowing it to build upon previously computed values.

Base case: dp[(T, [])] = 1 (base case: with T remaining time and no edges traversed, we can only visit vertex n)

Recursive case:
For each edge (u, v, t) in the graph:
    If u == 1:
        Consider visiting vertex v and then recursively exploring the subproblem dp[(T - t, [(v,) + path])]
    Else if t <= T:
        Recursively explore the subproblems for both options: visit vertex v and then recursively explore dp[(T - t, [(v,) + path])], or skip this edge and continue with the current path
        Update the maximum number of vertices visited

Memoization: Store the results in a dictionary dp and use it to avoid redundant computations.
