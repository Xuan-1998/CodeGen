===BEGIN PLAN===
Design a recursive function that explores all possible routes from vertex 1 to vertex n, and uses memoization to store the results in a dictionary, then use the stored values to construct the optimal route.

Define the state as a tuple (i, prev), where i is the current vertex and prev is the previous vertex visited; define the state expression as dp[i][prev], which represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex i within a time limit of T.

Formulate state as (i, prev): dp[i][prev] = max({dp[u][v] + 1 for u in range(1, n+1) if (u, v) is a valid edge and t < T}).

Implement dynamic programming using a bottom-up approach by iterating over the vertices from vertex n to 1 and updating the state values accordingly.

Define a dictionary dp where dp[i][prev] = max({dp[u][v] + 1 for u in range(1, i+1) if (u, v) is a valid edge and t < T}), and initialize all dp[i][j] to -1.

For each vertex i from n down to 1:

    For each previous vertex j:
        If there's no valid edge from j to i or the time limit has been exceeded, set dp[i][j] = 0.
        Otherwise, update dp[i][j] with the maximum value.

Construct the optimal route by tracing back from dp[n][-1].
