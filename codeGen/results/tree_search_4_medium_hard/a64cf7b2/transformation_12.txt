===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up approach with tabulation by maintaining a dynamic programming table dp[i] that stores the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within time limit T starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex i.
Define the state expression as dp[i], where i is the current vertex. The base case is when i == n, in which case the maximum number of vertices that can be visited is v + 1.
Formulate state and transition relationships as follows:
- For each edge (u, v) with weight t, consider all possible routes from vertex 1 to vertex u, and for each route, update dp[v] by taking the maximum between its current value and the number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex u within time limit T minus the weight of edge (u, v) plus 1.
- If there is no such route, set dp[i] to be the same as dp[i - 1].
- The final answer is the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex n within time limit T.
