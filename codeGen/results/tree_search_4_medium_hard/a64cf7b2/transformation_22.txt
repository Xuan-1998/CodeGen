===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n.

Consider the state as dp[i][t]: maximum number of vertices that can be visited within t time units, considering only edges with weight less than or equal to t.

Formulate a recurrence relation based on whether an edge with weight w can be traversed before reaching vertex i, i.e., (i-1)*T >= w.

dp[i][t] = max(dp[j][min(t-w, T)] + 1 for j in range(i-1) if (j-1)*T >= w)

Consider using memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant computation.
