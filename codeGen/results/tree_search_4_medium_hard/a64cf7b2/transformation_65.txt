===BEGIN PLAN===
Design a recursive function that explores all possible routes from vertex 1 to vertex n, and uses memoization to store the results in a dictionary.

Define the state as a tuple (t, i), representing the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within a time limit of t when starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex i. The state expression is dp[t][i], which represents this value.

State: (t, i)

Implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by iterating through all possible states (t, i) in reverse order (from t = T to t = 0), and for each state, compute the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the remaining time t. 

For each state, iterate through all edges emanating from vertex i, calculate the new time limit and the maximum number of vertices that can be visited in this new subproblem. Update dp[t][i] with the maximum value found.

Finally, construct the optimal route by backtracking from dp[T][n].
