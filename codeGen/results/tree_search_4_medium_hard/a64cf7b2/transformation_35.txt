===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a dynamic programming approach with tabulation to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n.

The base case is when i = n (end vertex), in which case we return 1 because we can always visit the end vertex itself.

Let dp[i] represent the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within a time limit of T, considering all edges that start at vertex i. The transition relationship is:

dp[i] = max(dp[j] + 1) for all j such that there exists an edge from vertex j to vertex i

We can use a dictionary to store the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, where the keys are the current vertex and the values are the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the remaining time.

Finally, we return dp[1], which is the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex n within a time limit of T.
