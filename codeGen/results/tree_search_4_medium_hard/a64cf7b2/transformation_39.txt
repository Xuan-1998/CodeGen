===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n.

The base case is when t = 0, in which case we return 0 because we cannot visit any vertices within 0 time units.

State: dp[i][t] represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited from vertex i to the end vertex n within t time units, considering all possible edges.

Utilize a 2D array with dimensions (n+1) by (T+1), where dp[i][t] represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited from vertex i to the end vertex n within t time units, and use a nested loop to fill up the table.

For each edge (u, v, t) in the graph, iterate through all edges that start at vertex u and have weight less than or equal to t. For each such edge, update dp[v][t-u] by taking the maximum between its current value and dp[u][t-u]+1.

To get the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex n within a time limit of T, return dp[0][T].
