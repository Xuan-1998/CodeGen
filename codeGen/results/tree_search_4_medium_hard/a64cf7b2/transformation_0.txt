===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a dynamic programming with bottom-up approach to solve this problem by iterating over all vertices and edges.

Define the state expression as (i, j), where i is the current vertex and j is the maximum number of visited vertices from vertex 1 to vertex i within the time limit j.

The state can be formulated as dp[i][j], which represents the maximum number of visited vertices ending at vertex i with a remaining time of j.

Transition relationship: For each edge (u, v, t) and for each vertex i in the range [1, n-1]:
  - If it's possible to traverse the edge from vertex u to vertex v within the remaining time dp[u][j-t], then update dp[v][j] as max(dp[v][j], dp[u][j-t] + 1).
  - Otherwise, just set dp[v][j] as the maximum number of visited vertices ending at vertex v with a remaining time of j.

Initialize the state dp[0][T] as 1 and dp[i][j] for all i in [1, n-1] and j in [1, T] to 0.

Fill up the dynamic programming table in a bottom-up manner by iterating over all vertices and edges.

The maximum number of visited vertices can be found at the last state dp[n-1][T].

Output the maximum number of visited vertices and the indices of vertices that can be visited on the route from vertex 1 to vertex n, in the order of encountering them.
