===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n.

dp: a 2D array where dp[i][t] represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within t time units when starting from vertex i.

dp[n][T]: the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within T time units, which is our final answer.

For each edge (u, v, t) in the graph:
    Update dp[v][t] as max(dp[v][t], 1 + dp[u][t - w]) where w is the weight of the edge.
This update rule ensures that we consider all possible paths from vertex 1 to vertex n and take the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within T time units.

Finally, return dp[n][T].
