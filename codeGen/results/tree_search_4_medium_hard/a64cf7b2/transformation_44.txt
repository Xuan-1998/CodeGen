===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n.

The base case is when t = 0, in which case we return 1 because we can always visit the current vertex within 0 time units. This is an important correction compared to your initial plan.

State: dp[i][t] represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited from vertex i to the end vertex n within t time units, considering all possible edges.

Employ a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, starting with the base case when t = 0 and then recursively building up the table. For each subproblem, consider all outgoing edges from vertex i and update dp[i][t] based on these edges.
