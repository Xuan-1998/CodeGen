===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n.

The base case is when i = n (end vertex), in which case we return 1 because we can always visit the end vertex itself.

Consider using a top-down approach with memoization to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n. The state is the current vertex i, and the transition relationship is the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the remaining time limit, considering all edges that start at vertex i.

Use a 3D table to store the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, where the rows represent the current vertex, the columns represent the remaining time, and the depth represents the previous vertex. This allows us to keep track of the vertices visited in the previous step.

Use dynamic programming to fill up the table by considering all possible edges and calculating the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the remaining time limit for each subproblem.

The final answer is the value at the top-right corner of the 3D table, which represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex n within a time limit of T.
