===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n.

The state is the current vertex i, and the transition relationship is the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the remaining time limit, considering all edges that start at vertex i, along with a dynamic programming table that stores the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the remaining time limit for each subproblem.

Use a 2D array dp[][] to store the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the remaining time limit for each subproblem. Initialize dp[i][t] as 0 for all i and t, where i is the vertex index (from 1 to n) and t is the remaining time limit.

The base case is when i = n (end vertex), in which case we return 1 because we can always visit the end vertex itself. For other vertices i, we consider the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the remaining time limit considering all edges that start at vertex i.

For each edge (u, v) with weight t, update dp[v][T-t] as max(dp[v][T-t], dp[u][T-t-1] + 1).

Fill in the table iteratively from n to 1. Finally, return dp[1][T].

The maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the time limit T is stored in dp[1][T].
