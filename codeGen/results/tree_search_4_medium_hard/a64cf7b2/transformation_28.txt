===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n.

The base case is when i = n (end vertex), in which case we return 1 because we can always visit the end vertex itself.

Create a table dp of size (n+1) x T, where dp[i][t] represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within t time units starting from vertex i.

Iterate backwards from i = n to i = 1. For each vertex i, compute the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex i and ending at vertex n within a time limit of T, considering all edges that start at vertex i.

To do this, iterate over all edges (u, v, t) such that u = i, and for each edge update the value dp[v][t + t_edge] as max(dp[v][t + t_edge], dp[i][t]) if it's less than dp[v][t + t_edge].

The updated value represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex v and ending at vertex n within a time limit of T + t_edge.

Finally, return the value dp[1][T] as the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex n within a time limit of T.
