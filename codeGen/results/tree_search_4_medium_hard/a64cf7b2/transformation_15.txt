===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a top-down approach with memoization to solve this problem by recursively exploring all possible routes from vertex 1 to vertex n, and store the results in a memoized dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state expression as (i, v), where i is the current vertex and v is the maximum number of vertices that can be visited up to this point. The base case is when i == n, in which case the maximum number of vertices that can be visited is v + 1.

Instead of considering only the last visited vertex, consider the time spent traversing edges from the previous visited vertex to the current vertex. Define a new state expression as (i, v, T), where i is the current vertex, v is the maximum number of vertices that can be visited up to this point, and T is the remaining time limit.

Use a dictionary-based memoization approach by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary and checking if the result for a given state has been computed before. When exploring possible routes from vertex 1 to vertex n, prune branches with insufficient time to traverse all edges.

In the recursive function, explore all possible routes from the current vertex i, considering each edge (j, k, t) such that j == i and the remaining time T >= t. For each edge, update the state by decrementing the time T and incrementing the maximum number of vertices v if k is not visited before.

For each visited vertex, store the result in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations. When reaching the target vertex n, return the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the given time limit.
