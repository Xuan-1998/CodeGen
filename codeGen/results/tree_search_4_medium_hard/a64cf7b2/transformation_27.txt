===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n.

dp[i][t]: maximum number of vertices that can be visited within t time units, considering only edges with weight less than or equal to t.

For each edge (u, v, w) where u < i and w <= t:
  Update dp[i][t] based on the number of vertices that can be visited by traversing an edge from vertex u.
  Consider two cases: 
    1. Edge (u, v, w) is included in the path: dp[i][t] = max(dp[i][t], dp[u][w-1] + 1)
    2. Edge (u, v, w) is not included in the path: dp[i][t] = max(dp[i][t], dp[u][w])

dp[0][T]: maximum number of vertices that can be visited within T time units starting from vertex 1.

Return dp[n-1][T]
