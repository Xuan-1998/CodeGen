===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming to solve this problem by building up solutions for subproblems and storing them in a 2D table dp[i][t].
Define the state expression as (i, t), where i is the current vertex and t is the time spent so far to traverse from vertex 1 to vertex i.
The base case is when i == n, in which case the maximum number of vertices that can be visited is v + 1.
Express the recurrence relation: dp[i][t] = max(dp[j][max(0, t - w)], j < i), where w is the weight of the edge from vertex j to vertex i.
The maximum value is updated as we traverse the graph within the time limit T.
Return the maximum number of vertices that can be visited from vertex 1 to vertex n within T time units.
