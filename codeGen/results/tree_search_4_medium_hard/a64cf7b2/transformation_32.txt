===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation and memoization to build up a table of maximum vertices that can be visited within a time limit for each subproblem, starting from the end vertex n.

The base case is when i = n (end vertex), in which case we return 1 because we can always visit the end vertex itself.

Let dp[i][t] represent the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within t time units ending at vertex i. The state is the current vertex i, and the transition relationship is:

dp[i][t] = max(dp[j][t - edge_weight] + 1 for all edges (j, i) with weight edge_weight)

Use memoization with a dictionary to store the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the remaining time limit for each subproblem.

For each vertex i and time t, we can calculate dp[i][t] by iterating over all edges starting at i and considering all possible routes ending at i within t time units. We keep track of the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within t time units ending at i, which is the sum of the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the remaining time limit for each edge's destination plus 1.

Finally, we return dp[1][T] as the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex n within a time limit of T. We also store the indices of vertices that can be visited on the route from vertex 1 to vertex n in the order of encountering them.
