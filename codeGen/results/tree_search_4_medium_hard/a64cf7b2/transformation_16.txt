===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a top-down approach with memoization and bottom-up dynamic programming to solve this problem by recursively exploring all possible routes from vertex 1 to vertex n, and store the results in a memoized dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state expression as (i, v, T), where i is the current vertex, v is the maximum number of vertices that can be visited up to this point, and T is the remaining time limit. The base case is when i == n, in which case the maximum number of vertices that can be visited is v + 1.

Initialize a memoized dictionary dp with (n, 0, T) as the initial state, representing the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex n within a time limit of T. The value for this initial state is set to 0 because no vertices have been visited yet.

Fill up the memoized dictionary dp using a bottom-up approach:

- For each edge (u, v, t) in the graph:
    - If u == i and v < n and t + dp[u][v][T] <= T, update dp[v][v][T - t] to be the maximum of its current value and v + 1.

Return dp[n][n][T] as the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex n within a time limit of T. This represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited on the route from vertex 1 to vertex n, in the order of encountering them.
