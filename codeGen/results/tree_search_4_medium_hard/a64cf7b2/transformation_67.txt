===BEGIN PLAN===
Design a recursive function that explores all possible routes from vertex 1 to vertex n by backtracking and uses memoization to store the results in a dictionary, then use the stored values to construct the optimal route.

Define the state as a tuple (t, path), representing the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within a time limit of t by following the edge sequence in path. The base case is when t == 0 or path reaches vertex n.

To implement dynamic programming using a bottom-up approach and construct the dp table row by row, starting with the base case (t=0) and iterating up to T. For each state (t, path), calculate the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within the time limit t by following edge sequence in path:

1. If the current vertex is n, return 1.
2. Otherwise, iterate over all edges from the current vertex to its neighbors. For each edge, recursively explore the neighbor and update the maximum number of vertices that can be visited.

Store the calculated value in the dp table for the state (t, path) as dp[(t, path)] = max_vertex_count + 1, where max_vertex_count is the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within time t - edge_weight by following the edge sequence in path.
3. If the time limit has been exceeded, return 0.

Construct the optimal route by backtracking from vertex n to vertex 1 using the stored values in the dp table. Start with the state (T, [n]) and recursively explore the neighbors of each vertex until reaching vertex 1. For each edge, follow the neighbor that maximizes the number of vertices visited within the remaining time.
