===BEGIN PLAN===
Design a bottom-up dynamic programming algorithm that fills up a 2D table dp[][] where dp[i][t] represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within a time limit of t when starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex i.

State: (v, t), representing the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within a time limit of t when starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex v.

Initialization: dp[0][t] = 0 for all t. This represents that no vertices can be visited if we start at vertex 0 (which doesn't exist in this graph).

Transition function:
- If there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v with weight w, then the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within a time limit of t when starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex v is equal to the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within a time limit of t-w when starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex u, plus one (for visiting vertex v).
- If there is no edge from vertex u to vertex v, then the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within a time limit of t when starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex v is equal to the maximum number of vertices that can be visited within a time limit of t when starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex u.

Bottom-up approach:
- Iterate over all edges (u, v) with weight w.
- For each edge, iterate over all possible remaining times t-w.
- Update dp[v][t] to be the maximum of its current value and dp[u][t-w] + 1.
- Repeat this process for all vertices i = 2, ..., n.

Final answer:
The maximum number of vertices that can be visited within a time limit of T is stored in dp[n][T].

Maximum number of vertices that can be visited: 
Print the values stored in dp[n][0], ..., dp[n][T] to get the maximum number of vertices that can be visited.
