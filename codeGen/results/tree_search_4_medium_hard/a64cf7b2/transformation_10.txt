===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a top-down approach with memoization to solve this problem by recursively exploring all possible routes from vertex 1 to vertex n, and store the results in a memoized dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

'Base case: if i == n, then the maximum number of vertices that can be visited is 1, because we end at vertex n.'

Formulate state as a tuple (i, remaining_time) where i represents the current vertex and remaining_time is the amount of time left to traverse edges from vertex i to its neighbors.

The transition relationship can be formulated as: if there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j with weight t, then we can visit vertex j if we have enough remaining time after traversing the edge. In this case, update the remaining_time by subtracting t and mark vertex j as visited.

Use a dictionary-based approach with memoization to store and reuse the results of subproblems, thereby avoiding redundant calculations and improving the efficiency of the algorithm.

In the recursive function, maintain a set to keep track of visited vertices to avoid visiting the same vertex multiple times.

Update the maximum number of vertices that can be visited if the current path is shorter than the previously found maximum.

Finally, return the maximum number of vertices that can be visited and the corresponding route.

The plan seems correct, but it might be improved by considering a more efficient way to explore the graph. One possible approach could be using a priority queue instead of recursion for better performance.

The potential issues with this plan include:
1. It does not handle edge cases like negative weights or self-loops.
2. The time complexity is difficult to analyze without knowing the exact implementation details.
3. It might be slow for large inputs due to the use of recursion and memoization.

By including a base case when i == n, we ensure that the function returns correctly when it reaches the destination vertex.
The plan includes edge cases by handling all vertices and edges in the graph, but it does not specifically handle negative weights or self-loops.
