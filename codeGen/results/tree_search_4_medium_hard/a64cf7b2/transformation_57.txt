===BEGIN PLAN===
Design a recursive function that explores all possible routes from vertex 1 to vertex n, and uses memoization to store the results in a dictionary, then use the stored values to construct the optimal route.

Define the state as a tuple (i, prev), where i is the current vertex and prev is the previous vertex visited; define the state expression as dp[i][prev], which represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex i within a time limit of T.

Formulate the state as (i, prev): dp[i][prev] = min({dp[u][v] + 1 for u in range(prev+1, i) if (u, v) is a valid edge and t <= T} or 1 if i == n), where i is the current vertex and prev is the previous vertex visited.

Use a recursive function with memoization to compute the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex i within a time limit of T, storing the results in a dictionary called dp. 

Construct the optimal route by tracing back the path from n to 1 using the stored values in dp.
