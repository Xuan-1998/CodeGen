===BEGIN PLAN===
Design a recursive function that explores all possible routes from vertex 1 to vertex n, and uses memoization to store the results in a dictionary.

Define the state as a tuple (i, j), where i is the current vertex and j is the maximum time left; define the state expression as dp[i][j], which represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex i within a time limit of j.

Let dp[i][j] be the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex i within a time limit of j, by considering the longest path that ends at vertex i and has total weight less than or equal to w. This is achieved by recursively exploring all possible routes from vertex 1 to vertex i, considering each edge's weight and the remaining time.

Create a dynamic programming table using a dictionary where the keys are tuples representing vertices and times, and the values are lists of maximum number of vertices that can be visited. Initialize this table with base cases: dp[1][T] = 1 (since starting from vertex 1).
