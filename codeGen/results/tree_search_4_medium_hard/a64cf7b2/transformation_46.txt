===BEGIN PLAN===
Design a recursive function that explores all possible routes from vertex 1 to vertex n, and uses memoization to store the results in a dictionary.

Define the state as a tuple (i, j), where i is the current vertex and j is the maximum time left; define the state expression as dp[i][j], which represents the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex i within a time limit of j.

Define dp[i][j] as the maximum number of vertices that can be visited starting from vertex 1 and ending at vertex i within a time limit of j, using edges with weights up to w. This can be calculated by iterating over all edges (u, v, t) where u is the current vertex i, and if there is enough time left (j >= t), then recursively calculate dp[v][j-t] and add 1 to it.

Use dictionary dp = {(i, j): min(...)} to store the results of recursive function calls.
