===BEGIN PLAN===
state: (i, partition) where i is the current index in the string and partition is a list of strings representing the palindromic partition so far,
base case: if i >= len(S), then return [partition] as it's the only possible palindromic partition

idea: iterate over the string S and for each character, try to add it to the current partition. If adding the character results in a palindrome, recursively call the function with the updated state.

step 1:
    initialize a dictionary memo to store the solutions of subproblems
    initialize an empty list result to store all possible palindromic partitions

step 2: 
    for each index i in range(len(S)):
        for each character c at index i in S:
            try to add c to the current partition
            if adding c results in a palindrome, recursively call the function with the updated state (i+1, [partition, c])
            else, skip this branch

step 3: 
    for each partition p in result:
        check if p is a palindromic partition
        if it is, add it to the final result
