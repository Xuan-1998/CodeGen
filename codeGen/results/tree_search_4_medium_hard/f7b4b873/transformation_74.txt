To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can use a 2D table where each cell represents whether the substring ending at that position is a palindrome or not.

Let's fill up this 2D table step by step:

1. Initialize a 2D table dp of size N x N, where N is the length of the input string S.
2. For each cell dp[i][j], we check if the substring S[i..j] is a palindrome or not.
3. If S[i..j] is a palindrome, then we set dp[i][j] to True; otherwise, we set it to False.
4. We start filling up the table from the top left corner (i.e., i = 0 and j = 0) and move diagonally down and right in a zigzag pattern until we reach the bottom right corner.
5. When we fill up each cell, we check if the current palindrome can be extended to the left or right by checking if S[i-1..j] is also a palindrome.
6. If it is, then we set dp[i][j] to True; otherwise, we set it to False.

Once the 2D table is filled up, we can easily generate all possible palindromic partitions of the input string by backtracking from the bottom right corner to the top left corner.

This plan seems correct and should work for solving the problem. The main idea is to use dynamic programming to fill up a 2D table where each cell represents whether the substring ending at that position is a palindrome or not, and then generate all possible palindromic partitions by backtracking from the bottom right corner to the top left corner.
