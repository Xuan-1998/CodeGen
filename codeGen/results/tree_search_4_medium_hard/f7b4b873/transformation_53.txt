===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i][j] be a boolean indicating whether the substring S[i..j] is palindromic.

Initialize dp[0][0] to True and set all other cells in the first row and column to False, since an empty string or a single-character string is always considered palindromic.

For each character c at index i in the input string:
    Initialize a variable prev_i to -1.
    For each possible partition of S[0..i] into two non-empty substrings (left, right):
        Check if left and right are both palindromes. If they are, update dp[i][j] to True.
        Update prev_i to be the index of the last character in the previous partition's right substring.

Return a list of all partitions that have dp[i][i] equal to True, indicating they are palindromic.
