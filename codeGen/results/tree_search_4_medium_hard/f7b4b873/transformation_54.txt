===BEGIN PLAN===
An alternative approach would be to use a recursive function with memoization, where each recursive call solves a smaller subproblem and returns its solution.
Let the state be the current partition of the string, and the base case be when the partition is an empty list, indicating that the entire input string has been processed.
Choose to use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a table with base cases for the empty string and single-character strings, then iteratively populate the table by considering all possible ways to extend each current partition.
Use a dictionary to store and look up the solutions of subproblems, essentially implementing memoization.
Consider using a set or a list to store the palindromic partitions instead of just storing them in the dictionary for better readability and easier iteration over the result.
Add checks for edge cases such as an empty input string or a single-character input string.
Initialize the dictionary with base cases for the empty string and single-character strings before starting the dynamic programming process.
