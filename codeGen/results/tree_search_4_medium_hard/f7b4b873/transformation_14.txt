state: (s, p) where s is the remaining substring to be processed and p is the current partition, base case: if s == '', then return [p]
Consider a state (s, p) where s is the remaining substring to be processed, p is the current partition, and memo is the dictionary storing all possible partitions for each substring; 
Transition: if s can be split into two non-empty substrings t and u such that t is a palindrome and u is also a palindrome or empty, then update memo with (t, [p + [u]])
Use a dictionary to store the dynamic programming table and initialize it with default values for each state.
The plan looks good so far. It correctly identifies the need for dynamic programming and memoization to solve this problem efficiently. The base case is also well-defined.

To improve the plan, we could add more details about how to handle edge cases. For example, what if the input string starts or ends with a palindrome? Do we need to include these in our partition list?

Here's an updated version of the plan:
