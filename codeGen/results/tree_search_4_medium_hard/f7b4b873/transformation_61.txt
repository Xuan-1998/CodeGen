An alternative approach would be to use a recursive function with memoization, where each recursive call solves a smaller subproblem and returns its solution.

Let the state be the current partition of the string, and the base case be when the partition is an empty list, indicating that the entire input string has been processed.

Use a recursive function with memoization where each call solves a smaller subproblem by finding all possible partitions for the remaining characters and returning their union.

Create a 2D table to store the solutions to subproblems, where each cell represents the possible palindromic partitions for a given prefix and suffix. Initialize the table with an empty list for the base case when the partition is an empty list.

Fill in the table by recursively solving smaller subproblems and memoizing their solutions. When processing a character, check if it forms a palindrome with any of the previously processed characters. If it does, add this palindrome as a new partition to the current solution.

Finally, return the last row of the table, which corresponds to the possible palindromic partitions for the entire input string.

Edge cases:

* When processing an empty string, return an empty list since there is only one way to partition an empty string (i.e., into no substrings).
* When processing a single-character string, return a list containing that character as a palindrome.
