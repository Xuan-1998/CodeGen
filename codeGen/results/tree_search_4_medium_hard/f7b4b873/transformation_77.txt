===BEGIN PLAN===
An alternative approach would be to use a recursive function with memoization, where each recursive call solves a smaller subproblem and returns its solution.

The state is the length of the current palindrome found so far, and the base case is when this length exceeds the maximum allowed palindrome size.
State: The set of all palindromic partitions of the string S found so far.

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you iterate over the string from left to right, and for each character, consider all possible palindromes that can be formed by including this character in the current palindrome. For each possible palindrome, check if it is a valid palindrome (i.e., reads the same forwards and backwards) and add it to the set of all palindromic partitions.

To improve the plan, you could use a 2D DP array where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring from index i to j is a palindrome. This would allow you to check if a substring is a palindrome in O(1) time.

Edge cases include checking for single-character palindromes (length 1), and also handling the case when the string S itself is a palindrome.
