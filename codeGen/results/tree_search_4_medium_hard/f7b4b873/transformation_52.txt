===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up tabulation by building up the solution from the base case of single characters and gradually constructing longer palindromic partitions.

The base case is when the length of the string is 1, since a single character is always a palindrome.

To define the state as a set of all possible palindromic partitions for each substring of the input string. This can be represented by a dictionary where dp[i] represents the list of palindromic partitions for the substring S[0..i].

Use dynamic programming to iteratively update this dictionary based on the state of its substrings. The recursive formula can be defined as follows:

* If the length of the current substring is 1, there is only one partition, which is the substring itself.
* If the length of the current substring is even and it's a palindrome, then we have two partitions: the first half and the second half.
* If the length of the current substring is odd, then we have three partitions: the first half, the middle character (which can be considered as one partition), and the second half.

Implement memoization using a dictionary where memo[key] represents the list of palindromic partitions for the substring S[0..key].

Finally, construct the result by iterating through the dictionary in reverse order and appending each partition to the result. This ensures that longer partitions are considered before shorter ones.
