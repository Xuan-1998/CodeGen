===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves finding all possible palindromic partitions of a string, which can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization and bottom-up tabulation.

state: (i, j) where i and j are the start and end indices of the substring to be checked for palindromeness
state: (i, j, partition) where i and j are the start and end indices of the substring to be checked for palindromeness and partition is the current partition

base case: if j-i < 1, then return [partition]
if s[i] == s[j] and j - i > 0:
    # recursive case
    for k in range(i+1, j):
        if s[k] == s[j-1]:
            new_partition = partition + [s[i:j+1]]
            dp[i][j].append(new_partition)
        else:
            dp[i][k-1].extend(dp[i][k])
            dp[k][j].extend(dp[k][j])

dp[0][N-1] contains the list of all palindromic partitions for the given string
