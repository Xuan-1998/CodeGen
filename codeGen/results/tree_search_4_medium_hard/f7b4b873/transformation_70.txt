===BEGIN PLAN===
The state is indeed the length of the current palindrome found so far, and the base case is when this length exceeds the maximum allowed palindrome size.

To avoid redundant computations by considering only those partitions that have not been explored previously, we can use a boolean array dp of size N+1 to keep track of whether each prefix of S has been partitioned into palindromes or not. Initially, all values are set to False except for the first one which is True because an empty string is considered a palindrome.

The transition relationship remains: Given a current partition, consider all possible extensions to this partition by adding a single character from the remaining part of the string S.

However, we need to be careful when extending a partition. If the last two characters of the current partition are not a palindrome, then it's not possible to extend it further, so we can safely prune such branches.

The recursive function should return a list of all palindromic partitions found so far for each subproblem, and the base case should be when dp[k] is True because that means S[0...k] has been partitioned into palindromes.

When extending a partition, we need to consider all possible characters as the next extension. This can be done by iterating over all characters in S from left to right.

The function should return an empty list if it's not possible to extend the current partition further (i.e., when dp[k] is False).

To avoid duplicate partitions, we can use a set to store unique palindromic partitions found so far. This way, we ensure that each partition is only counted once in the final output.

Finally, the function should return all unique palindromic partitions found for the entire string S when it reaches the end of the string.
