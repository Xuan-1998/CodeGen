===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up tabulation by building up the solution from the base case of single characters and gradually constructing longer palindromic partitions.

Define the state expression as whether the current character matches with its corresponding previous character in the partition. The current state represents a palindromic substring ending at the current position, and the next state is determined by whether the current character matches with its corresponding previous character in the partition.

Design a dynamic programming algorithm where each cell dp[i][j] represents whether the substring s[i..j] is a palindrome or not, with i and j being the start and end indices respectively. Initialize the base case as follows:
- For single-character substrings (i.e., i = j), set dp[i][j] to True if the character at position i is equal to itself.
- For longer substrings, recursively check whether the substring in between the two matching characters is a palindrome.

Once the dynamic programming table is constructed, iterate through the table and construct all possible palindromic partitions from the base case of single characters up to the original string length N. Each partition represents a list of palindromes separated by spaces or other non-palindromic characters.
