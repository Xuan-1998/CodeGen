===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up tabulation by building up the solution from the base case of single characters and gradually constructing longer palindromic partitions.

The base case is when the length of the string is 1, since a single character is always a palindrome. For strings of length greater than 1, consider each possible partition point i (0 ≤ i < N-1) in the input string S. If S[i..j] is a palindrome for some j > i, then the palindromic partitions of S[0..i] and S[i+1..N-1] are also palindromic partitions of S.

To define the state as a set of all possible palindromic partitions for each substring of the input string, and then use dynamic programming to iteratively update this set based on the state of its substrings. Use bottom-up tabulation by maintaining a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the list of palindromic partitions for the substring S[i..j].

The main idea is to fill in the dp table from left to right and top to bottom, considering each possible partition point i (0 ≤ i < N-1) in the input string S.
