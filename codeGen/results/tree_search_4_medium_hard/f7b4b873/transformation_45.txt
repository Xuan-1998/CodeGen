===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up tabulation by building up the solution from the base case of single characters and gradually constructing longer palindromic partitions.

The base case is when the length of the string is 1, since a single character is always a palindrome. We start with this base case and use dynamic programming to build up the solution.

We can consider each prefix of the input string as a state, where the state represents all possible palindromic partitions of that prefix.

Using bottom-up dynamic programming to build up the solution from single characters to longer palindromic partitions. We start by initializing an empty set for each prefix of length 1 (the base case). Then we iterate through each character in the string, and for each character, we add it to the current set if it's not already there.

If a character is added, we also recursively generate all possible palindromic partitions for the remaining substring (the suffix) and add them to the set. This way, we ensure that all possible palindromic partitions of the input string are generated.

Finally, we can iterate through each prefix of the input string, and for each prefix, we print out all its corresponding palindromic partitions.

This plan considers edge cases by ensuring that single characters are always considered as palindromes. The plan also takes into account the constraint that 1 ≤ N ≤ 20.
