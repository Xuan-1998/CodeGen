===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using Dynamic Programming, we can create a 2D table where each cell (i, j) represents whether the substring from i to j is a palindrome or not.

State: The current character being considered in the string S.
Base case: When the length of the current palindrome found so far exceeds the maximum allowed palindrome size.
Initialize the table with all values set to False.

For each character in the string S:
    For each possible partition of the remaining substring from the current character onwards:
        Check if this partition is a palindrome. If it is, mark the corresponding cell in the table as True.
    Keep track of the partitions that are marked as True and store them in the final result.

Since we're considering all possible palindromic partitions of the given string S, we can simply print out the contents of the table after the loop to get the desired output.
