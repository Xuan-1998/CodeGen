===BEGIN PLAN===
state: (i, partition) where i is the current index in the string and partition is a list of strings representing the palindromic partition so far, base case: if i >= len(S), then return [partition] as it's the only possible palindromic partition

state: (i, partition, memo) where i is the current index in the string, partition is a list of strings representing the palindromic partition so far, and memo is a dictionary storing the solutions to subproblems.

Use list comprehension to initialize memo:
memo = [[] for _ in range(len(S)+1)]

state transition: 
- if S[i] == S[j], then (i, partition + [S[i:j+1]], memo) where j ranges from i-1 down to 0
- else, then return all possible partitions that do not include the current character S[i]

base case:
- return [partition] when i >= len(S)

main function:
for i in range(len(S)):
    for partition in memo[i]:
        # recursive call here

return all unique partitions from the memo dictionary
