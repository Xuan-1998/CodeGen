===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up tabulation by building up the solution from the base case of single characters and gradually constructing longer palindromic partitions.

Define the state expression as whether the current character matches with its corresponding previous character in the partition. The state represents the current palindromic partition being considered, and the transition relationship is defined as appending the current character to the existing palindrome if it matches with its previous counterpart.

We can employ a bottom-up tabulation approach by constructing the dynamic programming table in a row-major order, where each cell's value depends only on the values of its left and top neighbors. This means we start by computing all possible palindromes for single characters, then gradually build up to longer strings.

To handle edge cases, we need to consider what happens when we reach the end of the string. In this case, since each partition must be a palindrome, we can treat the empty string as a palindrome and use it as the base case for our dynamic programming table.

The plan does not include any specific consideration for handling duplicate partitions or checking if all characters in the input string are used. We may need to add additional logic to handle these cases.

Here is an updated version of the plan:
