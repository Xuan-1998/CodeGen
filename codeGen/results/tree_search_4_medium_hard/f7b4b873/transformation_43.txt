The problem can also be solved using bottom-up tabulation by building up the solution from the base case of single characters and gradually constructing longer palindromic partitions.

Define the state expression as whether the current character matches with its corresponding previous character in the partition.

The state is a combination of the characters in the current palindromic substring and their corresponding positions within the original string, and the next state is determined by updating this information accordingly.

Create a dynamic programming table where each cell stores a list of palindromic partitions that can be extended from the corresponding character. The DP table will be initialized with the base case of single characters being considered as palindromes.

For each character in the string, check if it is a palindrome by itself (base case), and then for each previous palindrome partition found so far, extend the partition to include the current character, considering whether the current character matches its corresponding previous character. This step will lead to finding all possible palindromic partitions of the given string.

The final result will be stored in the DP table as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a palindromic partition of the input string.
