===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can also be solved using bottom-up tabulation by building up the solution from the base case of single characters and gradually constructing longer palindromic partitions.

Define the state expression as whether the current character matches with its corresponding previous character in the partition. The state is a combination of the characters in the current palindromic substring and their corresponding positions within the original string, and the next state is determined by updating this information accordingly.

Use a 2D table where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring S[i...j] is a palindrome.

Start with initializing the base case: for each single character in the string, mark it as a palindrome. This can be done by setting dp[i][i] to True for all i.

Then, iterate over the characters in the string and update the dp table accordingly:

* For each substring S[i...j], check if the first and last characters match (S[i] == S[j]). If they do, then the substring is a palindrome if and only if the substring without the first and last characters (S[i+1...j-1]) is also a palindrome. This can be done by setting dp[i][j] to True if and only if dp[i+1][j-1] is True.

Finally, iterate over the 2D table in reverse order (from bottom-right to top-left) and construct all possible palindromic partitions of the input string by backtracking through the dp table. For each partition, add it to the result list.
