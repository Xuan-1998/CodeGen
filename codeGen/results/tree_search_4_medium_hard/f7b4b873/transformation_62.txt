To solve this problem using dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach:
1. Initialize a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring from index i to j is a palindrome partition or not.
2. The base case is when the remaining substring is empty, in which case it's considered as a valid palindromic partition (i.e., dp[i][j] = True).
3. Initialize an empty list result to store all possible palindromic partitions of the input string S.
4. Iterate over each index i from 1 to N-1 (where N is the length of the input string S) and consider it as a potential partition point.
5. For each such partition point, check if the substring from i to N-1 is a palindrome or not by comparing characters in reverse order.
6. If the substring is a palindrome, then recursively generate all palindromic partitions for the remaining substring (i.e., from 0 to i-1) and add the current partition point as an intermediate step.
7. Store each generated palindromic partition in the result list.
8. Finally, return the result list.
