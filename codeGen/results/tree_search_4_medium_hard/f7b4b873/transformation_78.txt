===BEGIN PLAN===
An alternative approach would be to use a recursive function with memoization, where each recursive call solves a smaller subproblem and returns its solution.

State: The set of all palindromic partitions of the string S found so far.
The state is updated by considering each character in the string as the center of a potential palindrome. If the current character matches one end of an existing palindrome, it can be extended to both ends, effectively doubling the length of the palindrome.

Base case: When the length of the current palindrome exceeds the maximum allowed palindrome size (20), the function returns the set of all palindromic partitions found so far.

Memoization: Implement memoization using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems as they are solved, so that the same subproblem is not solved multiple times. This can be done by storing the sets of palindromic partitions for each length of palindrome in the dictionary.

The function would recursively explore all possible palindromes and their extensions, memoizing the results as it goes, to efficiently generate all palindromic partitions of the input string S.
