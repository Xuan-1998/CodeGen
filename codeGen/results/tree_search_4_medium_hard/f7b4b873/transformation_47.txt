===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up tabulation by building up the solution from the base case of single characters and gradually constructing longer palindromic partitions.

The base case is when the length of the string is 1, since a single character is always a palindrome. This is where we start our recursive function, with each character being its own palindrome.

To find all possible ways to partition the input string into palindromes, we can use memoization to store and reuse previously computed results. This ensures that we don't repeat any computations and thus reduce the time complexity of our solution.

The main idea is to start from the edges of the string (the first and last characters), and then gradually move towards the center. For each character, we check if it's a palindrome on its own, and if not, we try to find all possible partitions that include this character as part of a larger palindrome.

We can improve our plan by using a dynamic programming approach with a 2D array dp[][] where dp[i][j] is true if the substring from index i to j is a palindrome. We fill up the dp[] array in a bottom-up manner, starting from single characters and gradually constructing longer palindromic partitions.

The potential issues with our plan are that it might not be efficient enough for very long strings, since we're considering all possible partitions of the string. However, this can be mitigated by using memoization to store previously computed results.

Our plan includes edge cases such as when the length of the input string is 1 (in which case there's only one partition) or when the input string has no characters (in which case there are no partitions).
