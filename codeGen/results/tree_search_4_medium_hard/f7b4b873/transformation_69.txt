===BEGIN PLAN===
An alternative approach would be to use a recursive function with memoization, where each recursive call solves a smaller subproblem and returns its solution.

The state is the current partition of S, and the base case is when this partition cannot be extended further (i.e., it's a palindrome or there are no more characters left in S).

Transition relationship: Given a current partition, consider all possible extensions to this partition by adding a single character from the remaining part of the string S. This can either create a new palindrome or extend an existing one.

Implement recursive function with top-down approach and store intermediate results in a dictionary for memoization.
