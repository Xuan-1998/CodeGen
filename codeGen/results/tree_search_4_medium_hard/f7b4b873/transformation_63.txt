===BEGIN PLAN===
The state is a tuple (remaining_substr, prev_partition) and base case is when remaining_substr is empty.
1. Initialize an empty dictionary memo to store the results of subproblems.
2. Define a recursive function partition that takes a string s and returns all possible palindromic partitions.
3. For each character c in the string:
    3.1 If c is the first or last character, add c as its own palindrome into prev_partition.
    3.2 Otherwise, check if the substring from the start to the current position is a palindrome.
        3.2.1 If it's not a palindrome, skip this part of the string.
        3.2.2 If it is a palindrome, add it as its own palindrome into prev_partition.
    4. If remaining_substr is empty, return prev_partition as the final partition.
    5. Otherwise, recursively call partition on the substring from the next character to the end.
6. Update memo with the result of the recursive call and return the updated result.
7. Call partition on the original string s and update it in the memo dictionary before returning.
