An alternative approach would be to use a recursive function with memoization, where each recursive call solves a smaller subproblem and returns its solution.

Let the state be the current partition of the string, and the base case be when the partition is an empty list, indicating that the entire input string has been processed.

Use a recursive function with memoization where each call solves a smaller subproblem by finding all possible partitions for the remaining characters and returning their union.

Memoize the function calls by storing the results of previous recursive calls in a dictionary or cache to avoid redundant computation.

To improve the plan, consider adding a check at the beginning of the recursive function to see if the current partition is already a palindrome. If it is, return the current partition as a solution, avoiding unnecessary further recursion.

To handle edge cases, make sure to include checks for empty strings and strings with only one character, returning an empty list or a single-element list respectively.
