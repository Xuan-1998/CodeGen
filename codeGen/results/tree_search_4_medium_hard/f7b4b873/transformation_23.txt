state: (i, j, partition) where i and j are the start and end indices of the substring to be checked for palindromeness and partition is the current partition, base case: if j-i < 1, then return [partition]
state: (i, j, partition, palindrome) where i and j are the start and end indices of the substring to be checked for palindromeness, partition is the current partition, and palindrome is a boolean indicating whether the substring is palindromic or not
dynamic programming with memoization by storing the solutions of subproblems in a dictionary where the keys are tuples representing the state (i, j, partition) and the values are lists of palindromic partitions.
memoize the function by storing its results for repeated calls with the same arguments.
check if the substring is a palindrome and if it is, add it to the partition list
iterate over all possible substrings from i to j, check each one for being a palindrome, and recursively call the function on the remaining part of the string.
add the new palindromic partitions found in the recursive calls to the current partition.
generate all possible palindromic partitions by iterating over all possible substrings of the input string and recursively calling the function on each substring.
store and retrieve memoized values in a dictionary where the keys are tuples representing the state (i, j, partition) and the values are lists of palindromic partitions.
handle edge cases by ignoring spaces or punctuation characters when checking for palindromes.
