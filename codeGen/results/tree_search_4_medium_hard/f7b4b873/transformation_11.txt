===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves finding all possible palindromic partitions of a string, which can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization.

state: (s, p) where s is the remaining substring to be processed and p is the current partition
base case: if len(s) == 0, then return [[p]]

Formulate state as (s, i) where s is the remaining substring to be processed and i is the current index
Transition:
    for j in range(i, len(s)):
        t = s[:j+1]
        if t == t[::-1]: # check if t is a palindrome
            update dp with ((s[j+1:], p + [t]))
        else:
            break

Use a dictionary to store the memoized values for each state
dp = {}

Corrected Base Case: 
    instead of returning [[p]], return [[list(p)]]

Edge Cases:
    - if s is empty, return []
    - if s has only one character, return [[s]]
