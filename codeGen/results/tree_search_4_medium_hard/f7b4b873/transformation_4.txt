===BEGIN PLAN===
state: (i, partition) where i is the current index in the string and partition is a list of strings representing the palindromic partition so far
base case: if i >= len(S), then return [partition] as it's the only possible palindromic partition

states:
- (0, [])  // initial state
- For each character c at index i in S:
    - If c is the same as the character at index j in S (i.e., the current substring is a palindrome):
        + Recursively generate all possible palindromic partitions for the remaining substring (S[:i] + S[i+1:])
        + Add the current substring to each partition
        + Return the list of new partitions

memoization:
- Use a dictionary memo to store the memoized solutions of subproblems, with the key being a tuple of the current index and the partition so far, and the value being a list of possible palindromic partitions
