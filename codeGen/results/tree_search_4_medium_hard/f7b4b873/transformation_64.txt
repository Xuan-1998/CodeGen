===BEGIN PLAN===
An alternative approach would be to use dynamic programming with memoization, where each recursive call solves a smaller subproblem and returns its solution, storing solutions in a table as they are solved.

The state is a tuple consisting of the remaining substring to process and the previous partition.
The base case is when the remaining substring is empty.

Use memoization to store the results of subproblems, so that we don't recompute them.

To improve this plan:

* Use a more efficient algorithm (e.g., iterate through the string instead of recursing).
* Add error handling for edge cases (e.g., an empty input string).

Potential issues with the plan:
* The recursive function may cause stack overflow errors if the input string is very long.
* The memoization table can get too large if the input string is very long.

Edge cases to consider:
* An empty input string.
* A single-character input string.
