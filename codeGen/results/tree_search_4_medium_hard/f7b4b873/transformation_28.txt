===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization by building up the solution from the base case of single characters and gradually constructing longer palindromic partitions.

The state is a 2D array dp[i][j] representing whether the substring S[i..j] is palindromic. The base case is dp[i][i] being True if S[i] is a single character (i.e., itself is palindromic), and for 2 <= j - i < 2, dp[i][j] is True if S[i..j] is equal to its reverse.

The updated plan includes the following steps:
