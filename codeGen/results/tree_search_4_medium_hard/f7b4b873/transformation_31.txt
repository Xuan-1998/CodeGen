===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can also be solved using bottom-up tabulation by building up the solution from the base case of single characters and gradually constructing longer palindromic partitions.

The state is a 2D array dp[i][j] representing whether the substring S[i..j] is palindromic. We initialize the diagonal elements to True, as single characters are always palindromes. Then, we fill up the table in a bottom-up manner:

- For substrings of even length, consider the middle character and check if the two halves on either side are palindromes.
- For substrings of odd length, consider the middle character and check if one half is a palindrome (the other half will be empty).

We apply memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary or a hash table, so that when the same subproblem occurs again during the computation, its result can be quickly retrieved and reused.

Finally, we construct all palindromic partitions by iterating over the dp table and checking which substrings are palindromes. We generate each partition by considering every possible split of a palindromic substring into two halves.
