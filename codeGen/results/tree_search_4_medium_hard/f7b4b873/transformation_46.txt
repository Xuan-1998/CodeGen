The problem can also be solved using bottom-up tabulation by building up the solution from the base case of single characters and gradually constructing longer palindromic partitions.

The base case is when the length of the string is 1, since a single character is always a palindrome.
To consider each prefix of the input string as a state, where the state represents all possible palindromic partitions of that prefix. This allows us to avoid redundant computation and store previously computed results in a dictionary.

Here's how we can proceed:
