===BEGIN PLAN===
A recursive function with memoization can be used to solve this problem. The state is the length of the current palindrome found so far, and the base case is when this length exceeds the maximum allowed palindrome size.

State: A boolean array dp[] of size N+1 where dp[i] represents whether a palindromic partition exists for the string S from index 0 to i.

Function:
- Base Case: If the length of the current palindrome exceeds the maximum allowed palindrome size, return an empty list.
- Recursive Case: For each character in the string, check if it is a palindrome with the characters before it. 
  - If it is not a palindrome, skip this character and move to the next one.
  - If it is a palindrome, add the current substring to the result and recursively call the function for the remaining part of the string.

Memoization:
- Store the results of subproblems in the dp[] array and return the cached result when the same subproblem is encountered again.
