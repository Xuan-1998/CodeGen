===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up tabulation by building up the solution from the base case of single characters and gradually constructing longer palindromic partitions.

Define the state expression as whether the current character matches with its corresponding previous character in the partition. The state represents the current palindromic partition being considered, and the transition relationship is defined as appending the current character to the existing palindrome if it matches with its previous counterpart.

To avoid redundant calculations and optimize the solution, use memoization to store and reuse previously computed results.

Iterate through each character in the input string from left to right. For each character, check all possible partitions that end at this position by considering all substrings ending at this position.

For each partition, check if it's a palindrome. If it is, add it to the result list. If not, recursively generate all palindromic partitions for the remaining substring (i.e., after removing the current character) and append this current character to each partition if it matches with its previous counterpart.

Use memoization to store the results of these recursive calls and avoid redundant calculations.

Finally, return the list of all palindromic partitions found.
