===BEGIN PLAN===
The plan is to use dynamic programming with a 2D table to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computations.
Initialize a 2D table dp of size (N+1) x (N+1), where N is the length of the input string S, and initialize all values in the table to False. 
Iterate over the string from left to right, for each character c at index i:
    If the current substring is a palindrome (i.e., S[i-j] == S[j-i-1]), set dp[i][j] = True.
    For each possible partition of the remaining substring S[i+1:], 
        Check if there exists a previous partition that ends at j and can be extended to form a palindromic partition with the current substring.
        If such a partition is found, set dp[i][j] = True.
Return all indices (i, j) where dp[i][j] == True as the list of palindromic partitions.
