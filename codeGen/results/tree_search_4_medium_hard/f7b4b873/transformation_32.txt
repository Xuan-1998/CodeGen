===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up tabulation by building up the solution from the base case of single characters and gradually constructing longer palindromic partitions.
Let's define a 2D array dp[i][j] with size (N+1) x (N+1), where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring S[i..j] is palindromic.
We start by initializing the diagonal elements of dp as True, since single characters are always palindromes.
Then, for each character in S, we update the values of dp according to the following rules:
    1. If the current character is equal to the previous one (i.e., S[i] == S[j]), then the substring S[i..j] is a palindrome if and only if the substring S[i+1..j-1] is also a palindrome.
    2. Otherwise, the substring S[i..j] is a palindrome if and only if either the substring S[i+1..j-1] is a palindrome or the substrings S[i+1..k] and S[k+1..j-1] are both palindromes for some k.
The final answer is given by dp[0][N-1], which represents whether the entire string S is a palindrome.

This plan includes edge cases, such as when N = 1 or N = 2. For these cases, the algorithm will correctly return all possible palindromic partitions of the input string.
