state: (s, p) where s is the remaining substring to be processed and p is the current partition
base case: if s == '', then return [p]
Consider a state (s, p) where s is the remaining substring to be processed, p is the current partition, 
and dp is the dictionary storing all possible partitions for each substring; 

Transition: 
    - If s can be split into two non-empty substrings t and u such that 
      t is a palindrome and u is also a palindrome or empty, then update 
      dp with (t, p + [u])
    - For each character c in s, consider the following options:
        * Add c to the current partition p
        * Split s into two non-empty substrings t and u such that t is a palindrome 
          and u is also a palindrome or empty, then update dp with (t, p + [u])
    - If s is a palindrome, then add it to the current partition p
state: (s, p) => (sub_str, new_partition)
Transition: 
    - If sub_str is not empty and sub_str[0] == sub_str[-1], 
      then update dp with (sub_str[1:-1], p + [sub_str])
state: s == '' => return [p]
state: s != '' => dp = find_palindromic_partitions(s, [])
return dp
