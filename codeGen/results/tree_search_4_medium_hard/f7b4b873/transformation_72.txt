===BEGIN PLAN===
The goal is to find all possible palindromic partitions of the given string S.

State: The last character seen in the current palindrome found so far, and the length of this palindrome.

Base case: When the length of the current palindrome exceeds the maximum allowed palindrome size.

Recursive function:
- If the state's length exceeds the maximum allowed palindrome size, return a list with an empty partition.
- If the state is at the start of the string, consider all possible partitions starting from the beginning of the string. 
  For each possible partition, recursively call the function with the remaining part of the string and append this to the current palindromic partition.
- Else, consider the last character seen as a potential center for a palindrome. 
  If it's a single character or if it forms a palindrome with its corresponding character from the start, add this as a new possible partition.
  Recursively call the function with the remaining part of the string and append this to the current palindromic partition.

Memoization:
- Store previously computed solutions for each state in a dictionary to avoid redundant computations.
- Check if a solution is already stored before computing it. If it is, return the stored solution.

Edge cases:
- Handle the case when the input string has less than 3 characters (since these cannot form palindromes).
- Handle the case when the input string contains special characters or spaces.
- Handle the case when the maximum allowed palindrome size is too small to cover the entire string.
