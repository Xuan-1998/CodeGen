===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up tabulation by building up the solution from the base case of single characters and gradually constructing longer palindromic partitions.

Define the state expression as whether the current character matches with its corresponding previous character in the partition. The current state represents a palindromic substring ending at the current position, and the next state is determined by whether the current character matches with its corresponding previous character in the partition.

Create a 2D table dp where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the substring s[i..j] into a palindrome. The base case is when i == j, and the result is always 0 since a single-character string is already a palindrome.

Fill in the table by considering all possible partitions of the substring s[i..j]. If the current character matches with its corresponding previous character, then there's no need to add an operation to make it a palindrome. Otherwise, you can either add one operation (by adding a character) or split the partition into two smaller palindromes.

Once the table is filled, all possible palindromic partitions of the input string S can be constructed by backtracking from the bottom-right cell dp[0][n-1] to the top-left cell dp[0][0], and selecting those cells where the value is 0 (since they are already palindromes).
