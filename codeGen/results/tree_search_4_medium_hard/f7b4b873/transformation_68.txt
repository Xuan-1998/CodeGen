===BEGIN PLAN===
An alternative approach would be to use dynamic programming with bottom-up approach where we fill up a 2D table in a row-by-row manner.

The state is the current index and the length of the current palindrome found so far, and the base case is when this length exceeds the maximum allowed palindrome size.
Transition relationship: Given a current partition, consider all possible extensions to this partition by adding a single character from the remaining part of the string S. The new state would be the updated index and the length of the extended palindrome.

We start filling up the table by initializing the base case (when the length exceeds the maximum allowed palindrome size) with an empty list representing the palindromic partition.
Then we iterate over the string from left to right, for each character:
  - For each possible extension (palindromic or not), calculate its length and consider adding it to the current partition.
  - If the extended partition is a palindrome and its length does not exceed the maximum allowed palindrome size, add it to the list of palindromic partitions.
