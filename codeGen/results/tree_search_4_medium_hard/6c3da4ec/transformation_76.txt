===BEGIN PLAN===
Might consider implementing a tabulation approach by iterating over the binary string from left to right and calculating the maximum bitwise OR value for each suffix of the substring, storing these values in an array.
Let dp[i] represent the maximum possible bitwise OR value for any substring of length i in binary string s.

To develop an iterative approach to update the DP table by iterating over the binary string and updating the values based on the current character and previously computed values. For each suffix of length i, calculate the maximum bitwise OR value with the current character (0 or 1) and update dp[i+1] accordingly.
Implement a memoization technique by creating a dictionary or a hashmap where keys are indices and values are the corresponding maximum bitwise OR values to store the computed values for later use.

To find the maximum possible value in binary representation without leading zeroes, iterate over the DP table from left to right, updating the maximum value found so far. The maximum value is the sum of 1 (for the last bit) and twice the maximum value found in the previous iteration.
