===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with dimensions n x (n+1) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j]. The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1.
The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1, since there's only one way to pair these substrings. For the initial state (i.e., i=0), we can set dp[0][j] = s[j-1] for all j from 1 to n, as this represents the bitwise OR of the first character and an empty string.
Use a 2D DP table to store the bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, considering only those pairs where the second substring is at most j characters long.
Determine the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j] by iterating over all possible substrings and calculating their bitwise OR values.
For each cell dp[i][j], iterate from k=i to j-1 and calculate the bitwise OR of the current character and the previous substring's OR value, updating dp[i][j] if necessary. This ensures that we consider all possible pairs of non-empty substrings.
