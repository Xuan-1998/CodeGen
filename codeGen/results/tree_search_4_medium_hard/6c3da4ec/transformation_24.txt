===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with dimensions n x (n+1) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j]. The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1.
Initialize a 2D DP table with dimensions (n+1) x n, where dp[j][i] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the first i characters in s when taking the last j characters into account. 
Fill up the DP table by iterating over the rows and columns: 
For each cell dp[j][i], calculate the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[0:i+1] with the last j characters, considering all possible pairs of substrings.
The base case would be when i is 0 or n-1. For these cases, there's only one way to pair the substrings.
Iterate over the remaining cells and calculate the maximum bitwise OR value for each cell by taking the maximum bitwise OR value from two adjacent cells plus the bitwise OR of the characters in s[i+1].
In the end, return the maximum value stored in any cell dp[j][i] where j is between 0 and n-1.
