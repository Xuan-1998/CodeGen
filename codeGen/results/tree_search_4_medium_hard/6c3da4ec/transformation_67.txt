===BEGIN PLAN===
Implement a tabulation approach by iterating over the binary string from left to right and calculating the maximum bitwise OR value for each suffix of the substring, storing these values in an array.

Define dp[i] as the maximum bitwise OR value of two non-empty substrings that have a total length of i and can be obtained by splitting the original string s at some position j, where 0 <= j < i.

Determine dp[i] based on whether the current character in the binary string is '1' or '0'.

To calculate dp[i], iterate from j = 0 to i-1. For each j, calculate the maximum bitwise OR value for two non-empty substrings that have a total length of i-j and can be obtained by splitting the original substring s[j:i] at some position k, where 0 <= k < i-j.

When calculating dp[i], consider three cases:
- If the current character is '1', calculate dp[i] as the maximum bitwise OR value between the maximum bitwise OR value for two non-empty substrings with a total length of i-j and can be obtained by splitting s[j:i] at some position k, where 0 <= k < i-j, and the bitwise OR of the current character and the maximum bitwise OR value for two non-empty substrings with a total length of j and can be obtained by splitting s[0:j] at some position m, where 0 <= m < j.
- If the current character is '0', calculate dp[i] as the maximum bitwise OR value between the maximum bitwise OR value for two non-empty substrings with a total length of i-j and can be obtained by splitting s[j:i] at some position k, where 0 <= k < i-j, and the maximum bitwise OR value for two non-empty substrings with a total length of j and can be obtained by splitting s[0:j] at some position m, where 0 <= m < j.

Initialize the dp table using this recursive function that takes an integer i as input and returns the maximum bitwise OR value for two non-empty substrings with a total length of i.

The plan includes edge cases:
- The base case is when i = 1, in which case the maximum bitwise OR value for two non-empty substrings with a total length of 1 is simply the current character.
- When calculating dp[i], consider the base case i = 1 and the recursive case i > 1.
