===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a 2D DP table dp[n+1][n+1] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible bitwise OR value for any substring of length j starting from index i in binary string s.

Iterate over the binary string from left to right, and calculate the maximum bitwise OR value for each suffix of the substring.
For each suffix, consider all possible pairs of non-empty substrings within it, and calculate their bitwise OR values. 
Choose the pair that gives the maximum bitwise OR value and update dp[i][j] accordingly.

Finally, output the maximum value in dp[0][n].

Note: Since we are considering all possible pairs of non-empty substrings, we need to consider all possible suffixes and pairs within them.
This plan ensures that we consider all possible combinations of substrings and calculate their bitwise OR values correctly.
