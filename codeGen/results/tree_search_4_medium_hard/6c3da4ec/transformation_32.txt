===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization to store the bitwise OR values of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with a dictionary mapping tuples of (start, end) indices to their corresponding bitwise OR values.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max bitwise OR value for all pairs of substrings (s[k], s[l]) with k in [0, i) and l in [i, j)

dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for all possible pairs of non-empty substrings (s[0..k), s[l..j)]

Use a 2D array to store the bitwise OR values of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with state expression dp[i][j] = max bitwise OR value for all pairs of substrings (s[k], s[l]) with k in [0, i) and l in [i, j)

For each cell dp[i][j], calculate the maximum bitwise OR value by iterating through all possible pairs of non-empty substrings (s[k], s[l]) with k in [0, i) and l in [i, j), and updating dp[i][j] with the maximum bitwise OR value found.

The final answer is the maximum value in the last row of the 2D array, which represents the maximum bitwise OR value for all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s.
