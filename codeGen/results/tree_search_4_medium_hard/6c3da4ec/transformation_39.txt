===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about using memoization to store the bitwise OR values of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with a dictionary mapping tuples of (start, end) indices to their corresponding bitwise OR values.

Define the state expression as dp[i] = maximum bitwise OR value for all pairs of substrings (s[j], s[k]) with j, k in range(i), and base case is when n is 1 or 2

dp[0] = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
    dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], 
                {bitwise OR(s[j], s[k]) for j in range(i) for k in range(j, i+1)})
