===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with dimensions n x (n+1) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j]. The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1.

The transition relationship can be formulated as follows:

- For i = 0, dp[0][j] = s[0:j]
- For i > 0, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] | dp[k+1][j]) for 0 <= k < i

This is a correct approach. The plan correctly identifies the need for a 2D DP table and the base case.

To improve this plan:

- Initialize the DP table with 0's to represent the absence of any value.
- Fill the DP table iteratively, starting from the base case and moving towards larger values of i and j.

Potential issues with the plan:
- It does not handle edge cases where n is small. In such cases, it might be more efficient to calculate the bitwise OR directly without using a DP approach.

Edge cases:

- Handle n = 1 or s = "0" or s = "1". In these cases, there are no substrings that can be taken, so return 0.
