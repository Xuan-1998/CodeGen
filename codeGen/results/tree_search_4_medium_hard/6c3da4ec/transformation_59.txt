===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider implementing a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by iterating over the binary string from right to left and calculating the maximum bitwise OR value for each prefix of the substring, storing these values in an array.

Choose dp[i] as the maximum bitwise OR value of all prefixes ending at index i. 

Consider dp[i] as the maximum bitwise OR value of all prefixes ending at index i, considering two possibilities: either we take all bits from the current position (which would be dp[i+1]), or we don't take any bits from the current position (which would be dp[i+1]). The key observation is that taking the current bit has no effect on the bitwise OR value, so it's always optimal to include the current bit if possible.

Use a table to store the maximum bitwise OR values for each prefix of the binary string, updating the values as you iterate from right to left and considering the two possibilities. 

At the end of the iteration, dp[0] will contain the maximum possible value in binary representation without leading zeroes.
