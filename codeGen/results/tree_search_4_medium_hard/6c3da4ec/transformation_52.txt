===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can use memoization to store the bitwise OR values of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max bitwise OR value for all pairs of substrings (s[m], s[n]) with m in [0, i) and n in [i, j].
To implement memoization, we can use a dictionary dp where the keys are tuples of (start, end) indices and the values are their corresponding bitwise OR values.

The plan is to iterate over all possible pairs of substrings, calculate their bitwise OR values, and store them in the dp dictionary. Then, for each pair, we can find the maximum bitwise OR value among all its pairs and update it in the dp dictionary.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary dp.
2. Iterate over all possible pairs of substrings (s[m], s[n]) with m in [0, i) and n in [i, j].
3. For each pair, calculate their bitwise OR value using the bitwise OR operation (~a & b).
4. Store the bitwise OR value in the dp dictionary as key-value pair.
5. Initialize max_value = 0 to store the maximum bitwise OR value found so far.
6. Iterate over all possible pairs of substrings (s[m], s[n]) with m in [0, i) and n in [i, j].
7. For each pair, find the maximum bitwise OR value among all its pairs using the dp dictionary.
8. Update max_value if the found bitwise OR value is greater than max_value.

The plan takes care of edge cases by considering all possible pairs of substrings. It also considers non-empty substrings only.
