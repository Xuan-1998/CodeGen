===BEGIN PLAN===
Might consider implementing a tabulation approach by iterating over the binary string from left to right and calculating the maximum bitwise OR value for each suffix of the substring, storing these values in an array.

Let dp[i] represent the maximum possible bitwise OR value for any substring of length i in binary string s. 

Develop an iterative approach to update the DP table by iterating over the binary string and updating the values based on the current character and previously computed values.

Let's consider two cases: 

1. The current character is '0'. In this case, the maximum bitwise OR value for any substring of length i can be calculated as the maximum bitwise OR value for any substring of length i-1.
2. The current character is '1'. In this case, we need to update dp[i] based on the previous values and the current character.

Use a bottom-up approach to fill up a DP table, updating each cell based on previously computed values and the current character.

The initial value for dp[0] would be 0 since there's no substring of length 0. 

Initialize max_or as 0 to keep track of the maximum bitwise OR value seen so far.

Iterate over the binary string from left to right, updating dp[i] based on the previous values and the current character. Update max_or if a larger bitwise OR value is found.

At the end of the iteration, return max_or as the answer.
