===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 1D DP array to store the maximum bitwise OR value for all possible prefixes of s, with dimensions n+1 where each cell dp[j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the prefix s[0:j]. The base case would be when j is 0.

The state transition relationship can be formulated as follows:

* If j is 0, then dp[j] = 0 (since there are no bits to OR)
* For j > 0:
	+ If the current bit s[j-1] is 0, then dp[j] = dp[j-1]
	+ If the current bit s[j-1] is 1, then dp[j] = max(dp[j-1], s[j-1])
* Apply memoization by storing the maximum bitwise OR values for all possible prefixes in a dictionary or hashmap, and then look up these values as needed during the calculation process.

The maximum bitwise OR value for the entire string can be found by looking at the last element of the DP array, dp[n].

This plan considers edge cases by initializing the DP array to 0 and handling the base case correctly. The memoization approach also helps avoid redundant calculations.
