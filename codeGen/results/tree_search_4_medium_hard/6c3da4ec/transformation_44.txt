===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about using memoization to store the bitwise OR values of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with a dictionary mapping tuples of (start, end) indices to their corresponding bitwise OR values.

Define the state expression as dp[i] = maximum bitwise OR value for all pairs of substrings (s[j], s[k]) with j, k in range(i), and base case is when n is 1 or 2

Memoize the bitwise OR values of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s with a dictionary mapping tuples of (start, end) indices to their corresponding bitwise OR values.

Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem. Create a dp array where dp[i] stores the maximum bitwise OR value for all pairs of substrings ending at index i. Then, calculate dp[i] based on dp[j] and dp[k] for j < i and k > i.

To handle edge cases, consider initializing dp[0] to 0 or some default value when n is 1.
