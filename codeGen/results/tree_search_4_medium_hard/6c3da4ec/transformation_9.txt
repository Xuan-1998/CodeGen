===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with dimensions n x (n+1) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j]. The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1.

Let dp[i][j] be the maximum bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s that end at index j and start at least i.

Define the DP table as:
dp[i][j] = max(OR(s[k:j],s[i:k]) for k in range(i+1,j))

where OR(a,b) is bitwise OR of a and b.

Dynamic Programming with 2D Tabulation

Update the plan to include edge cases:

* Base case when j-i is 0 or 1: dp[i][j] = s[j-1] (since there's only one possible substring)
