===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider implementing a tabulation approach by iterating over the binary string from left to right and calculating the maximum bitwise OR value for each suffix of the substring, storing these values in an array.
Choose dp[i] as the maximum bitwise OR value of all substrings ending at index i.
Consider two possibilities: either we don't take any bits from the current position (which would be 0), or we take the current bit and the maximum bitwise OR value for all substrings ending one step to the right, which is dp[i-1] if s[i-1] == '0', otherwise it's dp[i-1] | (1 << s[i-1] - '0').
Use a bottom-up approach to populate the table by iterating over the binary string.
Initialize dp[0] as 0.
Iterate from i = 1 to n:
    If s[i-1] == '0', dp[i] is the maximum bitwise OR value of all substrings ending at index i-1, which is dp[i-1].
    Otherwise, dp[i] is the maximum bitwise OR value of all substrings ending at index i-1, or the bitwise OR of this bit and the maximum bitwise OR value for all substrings ending one step to the right, which is dp[i-1] | (1 << s[i-1] - '0').
Return the maximum possible value in binary representation without leading zeroes.
