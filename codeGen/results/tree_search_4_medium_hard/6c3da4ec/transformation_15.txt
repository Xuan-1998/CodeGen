===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table with dimensions n x (n+1) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s that end at index j and start at least i.

The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1. In this case, we can consider only one substring ending at index j and starting at index i.

For the state dp[i][j], let's consider all possible pairs of non-empty substrings that end at index j and start at least i. We can iterate over k from i+1 to j-1 and calculate OR(s[k:j], s[i:k]) for each k. Then, we take the maximum bitwise OR value among these calculated values as dp[i][j].

Let's initialize the DP table with base cases first: dp[i][i] = s[i] (as there is only one substring) and then fill up the DP table row by row starting from the last row.

Finally, return the maximum bitwise OR value in the last row (dp[0][n-1]) as the answer.
