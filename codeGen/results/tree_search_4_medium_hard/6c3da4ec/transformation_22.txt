===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 1D DP table to store the maximum bitwise OR value for each prefix of s, with dimension n+1.

The base case would be when i is 0, where dp[0] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the empty string (0).

For each character at index i in s, calculate the maximum bitwise OR value by considering all possible pairs of non-empty substrings that end at position i. This can be done by looking up the previous values in the DP table and performing a bitwise OR operation.

The DP update rule would be:

dp[i] = max(dp[j-1] | (s[j:i+1]))

This plan takes into account all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, considering only those pairs where the second substring is at most i characters long.

To find the maximum possible value in binary representation without leading zeroes, simply return dp[n].
