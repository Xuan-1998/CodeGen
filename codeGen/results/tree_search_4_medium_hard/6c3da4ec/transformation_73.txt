To analyze the plan, let's break it down step by step:

===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i] represent the maximum possible bitwise OR value for any substring of length i in binary string s.

Create a 2D DP table to store the maximum bitwise OR values for each suffix of the substring, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible bitwise OR value for any substring of length j starting from index i.

Use dynamic programming to find the maximum possible value in binary representation without leading zeroes by iterating over the binary string from left to right and calculating the maximum bitwise OR value for each suffix of the substring, storing these values in an array.

1. Initialize dp[0][j] for all j such that 0 <= j < n, where dp[i][j] is initially set to 0 because there are no substrings of length j starting from index i.

2. Iterate over the binary string from left to right. For each character s[i], calculate the maximum bitwise OR value for any substring of length j ending at index i and update dp[i][j] accordingly.

3. For each suffix of the binary string, find the maximum bitwise OR value by iterating over all possible lengths j of the substring and taking the maximum of dp[i][j].

4. The maximum bitwise OR value is the maximum bitwise OR value for any substring of length n in binary string s.

This plan seems to be correct and comprehensive, considering edge cases such as an empty or single-character input string (where the maximum possible bitwise OR value would be 0 or 1 respectively).

The only potential issue with this plan could be its space complexity, depending on how large the values of j can get. In practice, however, n is bounded by 10^6, so it should be feasible to use a 2D DP table.
