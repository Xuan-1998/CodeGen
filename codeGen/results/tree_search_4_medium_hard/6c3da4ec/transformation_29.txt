===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about using memoization to store the bitwise OR values of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with a dictionary mapping tuples of (start, end) indices to their corresponding bitwise OR values.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max bitwise OR value for all pairs of substrings (s[k], s[l]) with k in [0, i) and l in [i, j)

Think about using a prefix sum approach to efficiently calculate the bitwise OR values of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s.

For each substring (s[i], s[j]), calculate the bitwise OR value by iterating from left to right and updating the maximum bitwise OR value as we go. Use this calculated value for memoization.

When calculating the bitwise OR value, use a dictionary to store the prefix sum of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s. The key is the start index, and the value is the prefix sum at that index.

To avoid duplicate calculations, iterate over the string from left to right, maintaining the maximum bitwise OR values for all substrings ending at each position. This will ensure we only need to calculate the bitwise OR value once per substring.

Initialize dp[0][j] = s[j] (since there is no pair with a start index less than 0). For all other positions i > 0, dp[i][j] should be calculated based on dp[i-1][k] and dp[k][j], where k is the last position that has been processed.

When calculating dp[i][j], use the stored prefix sum to efficiently calculate the bitwise OR value of the current substring. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2).

The final answer is max(dp[i][j]) for all i and j.
