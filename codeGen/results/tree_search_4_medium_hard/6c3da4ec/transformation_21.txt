===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with dimensions n x (n+1) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j]. The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1, since there's only one way to pair these substrings.

The key idea here is that if we know the maximum bitwise OR values for all possible pairs of non-empty substrings ending at index i-1 and j-1 respectively, then we can use this information to calculate the maximum bitwise OR value for all possible pairs of non-empty substrings ending at indices i and j. This would involve considering all possible pairs where the first substring ends at index i and the second substring starts at index i or earlier.

Create a 2D DP table with dimensions n x (n+1) and initialize each cell to -1.

Initialize dp[0][j] for j = 0 to n-1 to be 0. This is because there's only one way to pair the empty substring, which is with itself.

For all i from 1 to n-1:
    For all j from i to n:
        If s[i-1] == '0', then dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j-1]) if j > i else dp[i][j] = 0
        Else, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j-1] | (1 << (s[i-1] - '0')))

Finally, return the maximum value in the last column of the DP table.
