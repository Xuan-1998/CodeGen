===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 1D DP table to store the bitwise OR values of all possible prefixes of s, with length n+1.

dp[i] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the prefix s[0:i].

The base case would be when i is 0. In this case, dp[i] is 0 because there are no bits to OR.

To calculate dp[i], consider the two possible cases:
- The last bit of the prefix is 0. In this case, the maximum bitwise OR value for the prefix s[0:i] is the same as for the shorter prefix s[0:i-1].
- The last bit of the prefix is 1. In this case, the maximum bitwise OR value for the prefix s[0:i] is the bitwise OR of the previous maximum with the value of the last bit (i.e., 1).

Use these two cases to update dp[i] based on dp[i-1].

Then, use the DP table to calculate the maximum bitwise OR value for any given pair of non-empty substrings. For a substring s[i:j], consider the following:
- The maximum bitwise OR value for the substring is the maximum bitwise OR value for the prefix s[0:i] (i.e., dp[i]) plus the bitwise OR of the values of the two bits immediately to the right of the substring in s.

Repeat this process for all substrings and update the DP table accordingly.

The final answer would be the maximum bitwise OR value for any given pair of non-empty substrings, which can be calculated by considering the two cases mentioned above.
