===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table with dimensions n x (n+1) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j]. The state is represented by i and j, and the transition relationship can be formulated as:
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] | dp[k][j]) for 0 <= k < i
The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1. For example, dp[0][0] would be initialized to 0 and dp[0][n] would be initialized to the bitwise OR of all characters in s.
The plan can be improved by considering the following:
- When updating dp[i][j], only consider substrings where j-i is greater than or equal to 2, as we are trying to find non-empty substrings.
- To avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency, the DP table should be filled from bottom-up. This means that the base cases should be initialized first, followed by a loop that fills up the DP table row by row starting from the last row.
The plan does not include edge cases for when n is 1 or when s consists of only one character. These cases should be handled separately to avoid incorrect results.
