===BEGIN PLAN===
Might consider implementing a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by iterating over the binary string from left to right and calculating the maximum bitwise OR value for each suffix of the substring, storing these values in an array.

Define dp[i] as the maximum bitwise OR value of two non-empty substrings that have a total length of i and can be obtained by splitting the original string s at some position j, where 0 <= j < i.

Create a table to store the maximum bitwise OR value for each suffix of the substring and use this information to update dp.

Fill in the base case: dp[1] = the maximum bitwise OR value of two non-empty substrings that have a total length of 1. This would be the largest possible binary number with one digit, which is 1.

For larger values of i, consider splitting the string at position j and updating dp[i] based on the maximum bitwise OR value for the left and right substrings. The update rule could be: dp[i] = max(dp[j-1] + (s[j-1] & s[i-1]), 0 <= j < i).

Consider implementing a top-down dynamic programming approach by defining dp[i] as the maximum bitwise OR value for two non-empty substrings that have a total length of i and can be obtained by splitting the original string s at some position j, where 0 <= j < i.
