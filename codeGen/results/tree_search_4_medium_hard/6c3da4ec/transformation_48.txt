===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about using memoization to store the bitwise OR values of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with a dictionary mapping tuples of (start, end) indices to their corresponding bitwise OR values.

The state expression could be dp[i][j][k] = max bitwise OR value for all pairs of substrings (s[m], s[n]) with m in [0, i) and n in [i, j] and k in [0, j)

Consider using a 3D DP array dp[i][j][k] where i represents the start index of the first substring, j represents the end index of the second substring, and k represents the maximum bitwise OR value for substrings from indices [0, i) and [i, j].

Implement a 2D DP array dp[i][j] where i represents the start index of the first substring, j represents the end index of the second substring, and dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for substrings from indices [0, i) and [i, j].

Fill the base case in the DP array by iterating over all pairs of non-empty substrings (s[m], s[n]) with m in [0, n) and n in [m, n]. Calculate the bitwise OR of these two substrings and store it in dp[i][j] for i = m and j = n.

In each iteration of the DP array filling process, calculate the maximum bitwise OR value for all pairs of non-empty substrings (s[m], s[n]) with m in [0, i) and n in [i, j]. Use this maximum value as the state for dp[i][j].

To solve the problem, iterate over all possible values of k. For each value of k, find the start index i and end index j such that dp[i][j] = k.

Return the bitwise OR representation of the maximum possible value.
