===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider implementing a dynamic programming approach by iterating over the binary string from left to right and calculating the maximum bitwise OR value for each suffix of the substring, storing these values in an array.

Define dp[i] as the maximum bitwise OR value of two non-empty substrings that have a total length of i and can be obtained by splitting the original string s at some position j, where 0 <= j < i. Initialize dp with zeros.

For each suffix s[j:i], calculate the maximum bitwise OR value for two possible ways to split it:

1. By splitting at position j: Calculate the bitwise OR of the integer values of the left and right substrings.
2. By not splitting at position j: Set dp[i] as the bitwise OR of the current dp[i-1] and s[j].

Use memoization with recursion, storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

To handle edge cases, consider setting base cases for the dynamic programming approach:

* For i = 0 or i = 1, return 0 as there are no possible ways to split the substring.
* For i > 1, use recursion and memoization to calculate dp[i].
