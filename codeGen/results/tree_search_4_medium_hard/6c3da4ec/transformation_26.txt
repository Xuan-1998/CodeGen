===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table with dimensions n x (n+1) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j]. The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1, since there's only one way to pair these substrings.

Construct a DP table with dimensions n x (n+1), not (n+1) x n as initially planned. This is because we want to consider the maximum bitwise OR value for each suffix of s, taking into account the first i characters when calculating dp[i][j].

Foster a bottom-up approach using iteration to build the DP table, rather than a top-down approach using recursion. This is because the problem constraints are quite large (n <= 10^6), and a recursive solution might exceed the time limit.

Use dynamic programming to fill up the DP table in O(n^2) time complexity. Iterate through each cell dp[i][j] and calculate its value by considering all possible pairs of non-empty substrings ending at index j, with length i.

The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1, since there's only one way to pair these substrings.

To find the maximum bitwise OR value for the entire string s, iterate through each cell dp[i][n] and return the maximum value found.
