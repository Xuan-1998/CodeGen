Define dp[i] as the maximum bitwise OR value of two non-empty substrings that have a total length of i and can be obtained by splitting the original string s at some position j, where 0 <= j < i.

Initialize an array dp with size n+1 to store the maximum bitwise OR values for each suffix of the substring.
Set dp[0] as 0 because there are no substrings of length 0.

Iterate over the binary string from left to right and calculate the maximum bitwise OR value for each suffix of the substring, storing these values in the array.
For each position i, consider splitting the current suffix at some position j, where 0 <= j < i.
Calculate the maximum bitwise OR value for two non-empty substrings that have a total length of i-j and can be obtained by splitting the remaining suffix s[j:i] at some position k, where 0 <= k < i-j.
Update dp[i] with the maximum bitwise OR value between the calculated value and the previously stored value dp[i-1].
Implement memoization using Python's built-in functools.lru_cache decorator to store and reuse calculated values.

Return dp[n] as the maximum possible value in binary representation without leading zeroes.
