===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with dimensions n x (n+1) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j]. The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1.

Let dp[i][j] be the maximum bitwise OR value that can be obtained by taking two non-empty substrings of s that end at index j and start at least i. The transition relation would be dp[i][j] = max(OR(dp[k][j],s[i:k]) for k in range(i+1,j))

Create a 2D DP table with dimensions n x (n+1), where dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j].

Let's calculate the final answer as follows: dp[0][n-1]

Let's handle edge cases. If n is 1, then the binary string is either '0' or '1', and we can directly return it.
