===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with dimensions n x (n+1) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j]. The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1.

The base case is incorrect because there are still multiple ways to pair these substrings. For example, for a binary string of length 2, the pairs could be ("00" and "11") or ("01" and "10").

Create a DP table with dimensions n x (n+1), where dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j].

Implement memoization using a dictionary to store the maximum bitwise OR values for previously computed subproblems.

Instead of considering all possible pairs, consider fixing one end of the pair and then iterating over all possibilities for the other end. This would reduce the number of subproblems to be solved.

Consider precomputing the bitwise OR values for single characters (i.e., substrings of length 1) and using these as base cases in the DP table. This could help speed up computation time by avoiding repeated calculations.

The plan does not include edge cases, such as when n is very large or s contains non-binary characters.
