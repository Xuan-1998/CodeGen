===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with dimensions n x (n+1) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j]. The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1. In this case, we can simply return s[i] as it's a single element and there are no pairs to consider.

For cells where j-i is more than 1, we need to iterate over all possible pairings of substrings. We start from the leftmost pair (s[i:j-1] and s[j]) and calculate their bitwise OR. We then compare this with the bitwise OR of the current cell and the rightmost pair (s[i+1:j] and s[j]). 

We repeat this process for all possible pairs until we reach the last element in the substring. At each step, we store the maximum bitwise OR value in the dp table.

Finally, we return the maximum value in the bottom-right corner of the dp table as it represents the maximum bitwise OR value for any pair of non-empty substrings of s.
