===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with dimensions n x (n+1) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j].
The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1. Initialize dp[0][0] as 0 because there are no possible pairs.
Let dp[i][j] be the maximum bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s that end at index j and start at least i.

Define the DP table as:

dp[i][j] = max(OR(s[k:j],s[i:k]) for k in range(i+1,j))

Memoization using Dictionary Data Structure:
To speed up computation, use a dictionary to store previously computed values of dp[i][j].
Iterate through the DP table and fill it with values from bottom-up.
For each cell, calculate the maximum bitwise OR value by iterating through all possible pairs of substrings that end at index j and start at least i.

The final answer would be the maximum value in the last row of the DP table (i.e., dp[0][n-1]).
This plan includes edge cases because it handles the base case where j-i is 0 or 1.
