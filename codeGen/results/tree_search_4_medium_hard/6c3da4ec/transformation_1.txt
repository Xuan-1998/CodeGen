===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table with dimensions n x (n+1) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j]. The state is represented by i and j, and the transition relationship can be formulated as:
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] | s[k] for k in range(i))
The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1. For j=i, dp[i][i] is simply s[i].
Consider using a memoization-based approach by defining a function that takes i, j as input and returns dp[i][j] based on the values of dp[i-1][k] for k in range(i).
For edge cases, consider initializing dp[0][0] to 0.
The updated plan:
Initialize a 2D DP table with dimensions n x (n+1) initialized to 0.
Define a function f(i, j) that returns the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j].
f(i, i) = s[i]
f(i, j) = max(f(i-1, k) | s[k] for k in range(i))
For edge cases, set dp[0][0] to 0.
Return f(0, n)
