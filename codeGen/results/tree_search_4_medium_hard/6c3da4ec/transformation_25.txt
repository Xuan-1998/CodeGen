===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with dimensions n x (n+1) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j]. The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1.

The plan can be improved by reducing it to a simpler dynamic programming problem. Instead of considering all possible pairs, we only need to consider the last character of the string and its OR with each prefix. This reduces the problem size from O(n^2) to O(n).

Construct a DP table with dimensions n x 1, where dp[i] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the first i characters in s.

Fill the DP table by iterating through the string and updating the maximum bitwise OR values based on the last character. This can be done by iterating from left to right and considering each prefix as we go.

Use a dictionary to store the maximum bitwise OR value for each prefix of s, then update this dictionary as you iterate through the string. This reduces the space complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).
