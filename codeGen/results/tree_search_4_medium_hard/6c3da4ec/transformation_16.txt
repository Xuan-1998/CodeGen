===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the maximum bitwise OR values for all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s with dimensions n x (n+1) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j]. The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1.
Let dp[i][j] be the maximum bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s that end at index j and start at least i. Consider using a 2D DP table to store the maximum bitwise OR value for all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s that end at index j and start at least i.
The state would be dp[i][j] = max(OR(s[k:j],s[i:k]) for k in range(i+1,j)) where OR(a,b) is bitwise OR of a and b. Implement memoization by using a dictionary to store the maximum bitwise OR values for all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with keys being the indices i and j and values being the corresponding maximum bitwise OR value.
To optimize the DP table construction, consider iterating from right to left (i.e., decreasing j) and then decrease i until it becomes zero. This way, you can avoid calculating the same state multiple times.
Consider handling edge cases by initializing dp[0][j] as 0 for all j. Then initialize dp[i][n-1] as s[:i+1]. The rest of the DP table construction would be similar to before.
To find the maximum bitwise OR value in binary representation without leading zeroes, you can iterate from the rightmost bit to the leftmost bit and keep track of the longest sequence of ones found. Finally, return this longest sequence of ones as the result.
