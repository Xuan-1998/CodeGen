===BEGIN PLAN===
Initialize an array dp[n-1] with all elements set to 0.

Iterate over the binary string from right to left (i.e., from index n-1 to 0). For each suffix s[i, n-1], calculate its maximum bitwise OR value.

dp[i] could represent the maximum bitwise OR value for all substrings ending at index i. It can be calculated as the maximum bitwise OR value of two possibilities: either the current substring ends here (which would be dp[i+1]), or it continues one more step to the left and includes the character at index i.

For each suffix s[i, n-1], calculate its maximum bitwise OR value by iterating over all substrings ending at index i. For each such substring, consider two possibilities: either it ends here (which would be dp[i+1]), or it continues one more step to the left and includes the character at index i.

Fill up the dp array in reverse order and then read the answer from the last element.
