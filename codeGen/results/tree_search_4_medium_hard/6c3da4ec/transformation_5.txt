===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 1D DP table to store the bitwise OR values for all possible substrings of s, with dimensions n+1 where each cell dp[i] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[0:i]. The base case would be when i is 0 or 1.
dp[i] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[0:i].
Use a 1D DP table with dimensions n+1 to store the bitwise OR values for all possible substrings of s. The state is represented by i, and the transition relationship can be formulated as dp[i] = max(dp[k-1] | s[k]) for 1 <= k <= i.
Design a recursive function that calculates the maximum bitwise OR value for a given substring, using memoization to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.
For the base case, set dp[0] and dp[1] accordingly, considering the initial conditions of the problem.
To find the maximum bitwise OR value for s, iterate from i = n down to 1, updating dp[i] with the maximum bitwise OR value found so far.
Finally, return dp[n] as the maximum possible value in binary representation without leading zeroes.
