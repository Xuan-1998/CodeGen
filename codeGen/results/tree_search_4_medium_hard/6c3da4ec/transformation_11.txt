===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with dimensions n x (n+1) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j]. The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1.
Let dp[i][j] be the maximum bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s that end at index j and start at least i.
Define the DP table as dp[i][j] = max(OR(s[k:j],s[0:k]) for k in range(i+1,j)) where OR(a,b) is bitwise OR of a and b.

The base case would be when j-i=0 or 1. In this case, there's only one possible substring (either the empty string or s[i:i] respectively), so dp[i][j]=s[i:j].

For the recursive case, we can use the following idea: for each k in range(i+1,j), consider the bitwise OR of the two substrings s[k:j] and s[0:k]. The maximum bitwise OR value would be when these two substrings have the largest bitwise OR value. This is because any other pair of substrings within this range would not give a larger bitwise OR value.

So, dp[i][j] = max(OR(dp[i][k],dp[k][j]) for k in range(i+1,j)).

Finally, we initialize the DP table with the base case values and calculate the maximum bitwise OR value for the entire string s by looking at the last row of the DP table.

The time complexity would be O(n^2) as we're using a 2D DP table, and space complexity is also O(n^2) to store the DP table.
