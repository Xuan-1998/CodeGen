===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about using memoization to store the bitwise OR values of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with a dictionary mapping tuples of (start, end) indices to their corresponding bitwise OR values.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max bitwise OR value for all pairs of substringers (s[k], s[l]) with k in [0, i) and l in [i, j)
dp[i][j] = max bitwise OR value for all pairs of substrings (s[k], s[l]) with k in [0, i) and l in [i, j+1)

Implement memoization by storing the bitwise OR values in the dictionary and checking if they are already calculated before calculating them. 

For edge cases, handle n = 1, which would be an empty string or a single character.

Also, consider using a sliding window approach to reduce computational complexity.
