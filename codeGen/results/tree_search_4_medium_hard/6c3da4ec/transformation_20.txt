===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with dimensions n x (n+1) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j]. The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1.

The correct base case would not only consider when j-i is 0 or 1 but also when i equals j, since there's only one way to pair these substrings in these cases.

Create a DP table with dimensions n x (n+1), where dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j].

Dynamically update the DP table by iterating through the string from left to right, considering all possible pairs of substrings and updating the maximum bitwise OR value accordingly.

For each position i in the string, consider the following cases:
- If j-i is 1, the only possible pair is the substring s[i:j], so dp[i][j] would be equal to the integer value of this substring.
- If j-i is greater than 1, then there are two options: either include or exclude the character at position i from the first substring. Calculate the maximum bitwise OR value for these two cases and choose the maximum.
