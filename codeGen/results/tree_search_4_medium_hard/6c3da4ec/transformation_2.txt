===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with dimensions n x (n+1) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j]. The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1.

The plan is correct in its approach to use a 2D DP table. However, it can be improved by observing that the state only depends on the previous state and the current character, not all previous characters. This means we can reduce the space complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).

Here's an updated version of the plan:
