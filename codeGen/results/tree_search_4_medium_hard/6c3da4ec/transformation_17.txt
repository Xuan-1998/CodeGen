===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s, with dimensions n x (n+1) where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum bitwise OR value for the substring s[i:j]. The base case would be when j-i is 0 or 1.

Let dp[i][j] be the maximum bitwise OR of all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s that end at index j and start at least i.
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the maximum bitwise OR value for all possible pairs of non-empty substrings of s that end at index j and start at least i. The state would be dp[i][j] = max(OR(s[k:j],s[0:k-1]) for k in range(i+1,j)) where OR(a,b) is bitwise OR of a and b.

The recurrence relation is correct, but it should consider the maximum bitwise OR value for substrings ending at index j and starting at least i. This can be achieved by iterating over all possible starting indices from i to j-1 and calculating the maximum bitwise OR value with each of these substrings.

Use tabulation to solve this problem by initializing a 2D DP table with dimensions n x (n+1), filling it up in bottom-up manner using the recurrence relation, and finally return the maximum value in the last row of the DP table.

The plan does not include edge cases. To handle edge cases, consider the case when j-i is 0 or 1. In this case, dp[i][j] should be set to s[i:j] because there is only one substring.

Here's the updated version:
