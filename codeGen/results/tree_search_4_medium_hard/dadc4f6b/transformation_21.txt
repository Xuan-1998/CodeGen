===BEGIN PLAN===
For each query, we will calculate the total brightness for the given rectangular view and store these values in a memoized table to avoid recalculating the same value multiple times.

A state consists of two indices i and j indicating which stars are currently within the rectangular view.

State: (i, j), where:
- i is the index of the leftmost star that has not been covered by the current view
- j is the index of the topmost star that has not been covered by the current view

Transition relationship:
- The state transitions when a new line segment is added to the view.

To efficiently calculate the total brightness within the rectangular view at each time step, we maintain a priority queue of stars and use it to determine which stars are currently visible. We prioritize the stars based on their distance from the current query coordinates.

Memoization:
- Store the calculated values in a memoized table.
- Check if the state is already present in the memoized table before calculating the total brightness for each query.

To ensure correctness, we handle edge cases as follows:

- When i or j reaches n (the number of stars), it means that all stars are within the rectangular view. In this case, the total brightness is the sum of the initial brightness of all stars.
- When i is 0 and j is n - 1, it means that all stars are initially visible. In this case, the total brightness is the sum of the initial brightness of all stars.

The plan is correct, but we can improve it by using a more efficient data structure for the priority queue, such as a balanced binary search tree (e.g., an AVL tree or a red-black tree). This will reduce the time complexity for calculating the total brightness within the rectangular view at each time step.
