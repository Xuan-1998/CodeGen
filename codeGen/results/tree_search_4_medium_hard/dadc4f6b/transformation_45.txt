===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the total brightness of stars within a rectangle can be broken down into smaller rectangles. Use dynamic programming with tabulation by iterating over all possible views and calculating the total brightness for each view.

Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum brightness of stars in the i-th time slice, where 0 <= i < q. Initialize dp[0][j] to s_j * c (the initial brightness) for j = 0 to n-1.

For each view and time t:
    For each rectangle x1i <= x <= x2i and y1i <= y <= y2i within the viewed rectangle:
        Calculate the total brightness of stars within this rectangle at time t as the sum of the initial brightness of stars with coordinates (x, y) that fall within the rectangle.
        Update dp[t][j] to be the maximum of its current value and the total brightness calculated above for all j.

The final answer is the last value in the dp array, which represents the maximum brightness at time t = q-1.
