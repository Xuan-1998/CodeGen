===BEGIN PLAN===
For each query, calculate the total brightness for the given rectangular view and store these values in a memoized table. This allows you to avoid recalculating the same value multiple times.

A state consists of two indices i and j indicating which stars are currently within the rectangular view.
State: (i, j), where i is the number of stars within the current view and j is the maximum brightness of these stars.

Transition relationship: The state transitions when a star enters or exits the current view. To determine if a star is within the view, check if its coordinates fall within the given rectangular view's lower left and upper right corners.
Maintain a dictionary or hashmap to store the memoized values, where the key is the state (i, j) and the value is the calculated total brightness.

Initialize an empty memoized table and add the base case: (0, 0) with a total brightness of 0. 

For each query:
1. Determine the lower left corner (x1, y1) and upper right corner (x2, y2) of the rectangular view.
2. Initialize i to 0 and j to 0.
3. For each star:
    1. Check if the star's coordinates are within the current view's bounds.
    2. If they are, increment i by 1 and update j with the maximum brightness between j and s_i (the initial brightness of the star).
4. Look up the memoized value for state (i, j). If it exists, return the stored total brightness.
5. Otherwise:
    1. Calculate the total brightness for the current state (i, j) by summing the initial brightnesses of the stars within the view and multiplying by their maximum brightness.
    2. Store the calculated value in the memoized table with key (i, j).
6. Return the stored total brightness.
