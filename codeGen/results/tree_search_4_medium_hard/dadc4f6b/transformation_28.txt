===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the total brightness of stars within a rectangle can be broken down into smaller rectangles.

State: (t, x1, y1, x2, y2), where (x1, y1) is the lower left corner and (x2, y2) is the upper right corner of the rectangle at time t.

Dynamic Programming with Tabulation: Create a 3D array to store the total brightness for each state (t, x1, y1, x2, y2), where t ranges from 0 to q-1 and (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) range from 1 to 100.

Fill the 3D array using a bottom-up approach:

* Initialize the base cases for each rectangle with no stars inside it.
* For each time t and rectangle coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2), calculate the total brightness of stars that fall within this rectangle at time t. This can be done by iterating over all star coordinates and checking if they are within the current rectangle.
* Update the state values in the 3D array by considering the previous states with the same rectangle coordinates but different times.

The final answer is obtained by summing up the total brightness for each view, which corresponds to the total brightness of stars that fall within the given rectangle at time t_i.
