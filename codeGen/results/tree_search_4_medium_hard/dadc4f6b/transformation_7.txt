===BEGIN PLAN===
The subproblems are based on a rectangle view, considering overlapping views in terms of their coordinates. One possible approach is to use dynamic programming with memoization.

The state is a tuple (t, r) where t is the time and r is a set of rectangles viewed up to that time.
- Base case: when there are no views left

The state is a tuple (t, s) where t is the time and s is the set of stars viewed up to that time
- Next state: (t+1, s') where s' is the updated set of stars considering the current star's visibility at time t+1

Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computations.
