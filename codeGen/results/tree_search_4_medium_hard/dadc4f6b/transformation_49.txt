===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the total brightness of stars within a rectangle can be broken down into smaller rectangles. Use dynamic programming with tabulation by iterating over all possible views and calculating the total brightness for each view.

Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum brightness at time i, considering the first j stars.
The base case could be when there are no stars in the view, i.e., all star positions fall outside the rectangle. In this case, the total brightness is 0.
For each pair of coordinates (x1i, y1i) and (x2i, yi), calculate the maximum brightness of stars within the view at time i.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k]) where k is a star position such that x1i <= xk <= x2i and y1i <= yk <= yi

Tabulation using a 2D array dp to store the cumulative sum of brightness for each view at different times. Then, calculate the total brightness for each view by iterating over all possible views.
Calculate the total brightness for each view at time t:
total_brightness = max(dp[t][j]) where j is the number of stars in the current view
