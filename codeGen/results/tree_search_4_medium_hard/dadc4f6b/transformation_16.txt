===BEGIN PLAN===
For each query, calculate the total brightness for the given rectangular view, and store these values in a memoized table. This allows you to avoid recalculating the same value multiple times.

The state is a tuple containing the star's initial brightness s_i, its position (x, y), and the current time t: (s_i, x, y, t).

The state transitions are obtained by moving to neighboring cells based on coordinates. The priority queue will help in maintaining the stars that are currently within the view's bounds.

At each step, iterate over all stars in the view's bounds, and calculate the total brightness for each star.
The total brightness is calculated as the sum of initial brightnesses of all stars within the current view's bounds.

Finally, return the total brightness for the given rectangular view.
