===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the total brightness of stars within a rectangle can be broken down into smaller rectangles. Use dynamic programming with tabulation by iterating over all possible views and calculating the total brightness for each view.

The state expression could be the time t, representing the current moment of interest.
The state represents a snapshot in time for the x-coordinate j of the viewed rectangle. The transition relationships can be defined by updating the total brightness as new rectangles are considered.

To implement tabulation, create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the total brightness at time i for the x-coordinate j of the viewed rectangle. Initialize all values to 0 and fill in the table by iterating over all possible views.
For each view, iterate over the x-coordinates within the view and update the total brightness as follows:
    - For each star within the view, check if it's visible at time t based on its initial brightness s_i and current position (x_i, y_i). If it's visible, add its initial brightness to the total brightness.
    - Update dp[t][j] with the calculated total brightness.

The final answer can be obtained by iterating over all views and summing up the total brightness for each view at time t.
