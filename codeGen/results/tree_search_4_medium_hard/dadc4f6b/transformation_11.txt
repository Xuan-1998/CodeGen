===BEGIN PLAN===
For each query, calculate the total brightness for the given rectangular view by iterating over all stars and summing up their initial brightness if they are within the rectangle at the given time. This can be done using a 2D table where each cell represents whether a star is within the rectangle or not.

The state is (x1, y1, x2, y2): the coordinates of the lower left corner and upper right corner of the rectangle.
This problem can be solved by creating a 2D table where each cell represents whether a star is within the rectangle or not. The state would be the current time and the transition relationship would be to update the status at the next time step.

Implement dynamic programming by initializing a 3D table and filling it up iteratively based on the problem constraints.
Update the table for each query: iterate over all stars, check if they are within the rectangle, and sum up their initial brightness.
