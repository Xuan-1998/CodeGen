===BEGIN PLAN===
For each query, calculate the total brightness for the given rectangular view by iterating over all stars that fall within the view's bounds and summing up their initial brightness values.

1. Initialize an empty memoized table with dimensions equal to the maximum possible time (10^9) and coordinates (100 x 100).

2. For each star, calculate its state at every time step from t = 0 to the given query time, considering only stars that fall within the view's bounds.

3. When calculating a state for a star, consider its initial brightness, current position, and the given query time. This allows you to determine if the star is within the viewed rectangle or not.

4. Store each calculated state in the memoized table as (s_i, x, y, t) where s_i is the initial brightness of the i-th star, and (x, y, t) are the coordinates and time for that star.

5. For each query, iterate over all stars within the view's bounds and sum up their stored states to obtain the total brightness for that query.

6. Store the calculated total brightness in an answer table with dimensions equal to the number of queries (q).

7. Finally, return the answer table where the i-th entry corresponds to the total brightness at the i-th query time.

This updated plan considers all stars within each view and avoids recalculating states by utilizing memoization.
