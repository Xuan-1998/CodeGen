===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the total brightness of stars within a rectangle can be broken down into smaller rectangles. Use dynamic programming with tabulation by iterating over all possible views and calculating the total brightness for each view.

The state expression could be the time t, representing the current moment of interest.
The state represents a valid view rectangle within the given time frame. The transition relationships can be defined by iterating over all possible views.

Use a 2D table where the state is the time t and the value is the total brightness of stars within the corresponding rectangle. Initialize the table with zeros to represent unknown values.

Iterate over each view, calculate the total brightness for the current view, and update the table accordingly. To do this, iterate over all stars that fall within the viewed rectangle and add their initial brightness if they are still active at the given time t (i.e., their time of activation is less than or equal to t).

When iterating over each view, consider only the stars whose coordinates lie within the viewed rectangle. This can be achieved by iterating over the stars and checking if their coordinates satisfy the constraints.

The total brightness for a given view can be calculated as the sum of initial brightnesses of all stars that fall within the viewed rectangle and are still active at the given time t.
