===BEGIN PLAN===
For each query, calculate the total brightness for the given rectangular view by iterating over all stars within the rectangle and adding their initial brightness if they are visible at the given time. This allows you to avoid recalculating the same value multiple times.

The state is (x1, y1, x2, y2, t): the coordinates of the lower left corner and upper right corner of the rectangle, as well as the time.
This problem can be solved by creating a 3D table where each cell represents the total brightness at time t and coordinates (x, y) within the rectangle. The state would be the current time and the transition relationship would be to update the total brightness at the next time step.

Create a 3D table of size (100+1)*(100+1)*10, where each cell represents the total brightness at time t and coordinates (x, y) within the rectangle.
