===BEGIN PLAN===
The subproblems are based on a rectangle view, considering overlapping views in terms of their coordinates. One possible approach is to use dynamic programming with memoization.

The state is a pair (t, r) where t is the time and r is a set of rectangles viewed up to that time, with the base case being when there are no views left.

Consider a state (t, r) where t is the time and r is the set of rectangles viewed up to that time. The next state would be (t+1, r') where r' is the updated set of rectangles considering the current rectangle's visibility at time t+1.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with memoization as follows:

* Initialize a 2D array dp of size n x c filled with zeros.
* Define a function f(t, r) that calculates the total brightness for the given state (t, r).
* For each rectangle vi in r:
    * If vi is visible at time t, update dp[t][c] with the sum of initial brightnesses of stars within vi and recursively call f(t+1, r') where r' is the updated set of rectangles.
    * Else, do nothing (since vi is not visible).
* Return the value of dp[q][c] as the total brightness for the given time q.

This approach considers overlapping views in terms of their coordinates. By using dynamic programming with memoization, we avoid redundant calculations and ensure an efficient solution.
