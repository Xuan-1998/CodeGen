===BEGIN PLAN===
The subproblems are based on a rectangle view, considering overlapping views in terms of their coordinates. One possible approach is to use dynamic programming with memoization.

The state is a pair (t, r) where t is the time and r is a set of rectangles viewed up to that time, with the base case being when there are no views left.

The state transition function f(t, r) can be calculated as follows:
- If there are no more views (r == []), return c (initial brightness).
- Iterate over each rectangle in r.
  - Calculate the intersection of this rectangle with all previously viewed rectangles.
  - Add the initial brightness of stars within the intersection to the current total brightness.
  - Update the state t and r by shifting the coordinates of the rectangles to consider the current rectangle's overlap with others.

Create a 3D DP table dp[n][q][max(x1, x2)][max(y1, y2)] filled with initial brightness value c. The dynamic programming equation is:
dp[t][r] = c
- If there are no more views (r == []), return c.
- Iterate over each rectangle in r.
  - Calculate the intersection of this rectangle with all previously viewed rectangles.
  - Add the initial brightness of stars within the intersection to the current total brightness.

The final answer is dp[q][[]][max(x1, x2)][max(y1, y2)].
