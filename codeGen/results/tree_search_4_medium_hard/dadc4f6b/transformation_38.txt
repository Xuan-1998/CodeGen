===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the total brightness of stars within a rectangle can be broken down into smaller rectangles. This can be achieved by iterating over all possible views and calculating the total brightness for each view.

The state expression could be the time t, representing the current moment of interest.
The state represents a snapshot in time for the x-coordinate of the viewed rectangle. The transition relationships can be defined by updating the total brightness as new rectangles are considered.

To implement memoization, define a function f(t, x1, x2, y1, y2) that calculates the total brightness at time t for the rectangle with coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). 

The recursive relationship can be defined as follows:
f(t, x1, x2, y1, y2) = sum of brightnesses of stars within the current rectangle + f(t-1, x1, min(x2, x_i), y1, min(y2, y_i)) for all i such that (min(x2, x_i), min(y2, y_i)) is within the previous rectangle.

Use memoization to store previously computed values and avoid redundant calculations. This way, we can efficiently calculate the total brightness of stars in a given rectangular view at a given time.
