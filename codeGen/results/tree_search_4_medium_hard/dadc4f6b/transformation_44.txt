===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the total brightness of stars within a rectangle can be broken down into smaller rectangles. Use dynamic programming with tabulation by iterating over all possible views and calculating the total brightness for each view.

Initialize a 2D array dp of size (100*100+1) * (10^9+1) to store the maximum brightness for each possible view.

For each star, calculate its initial brightness based on its position within the rectangle. Use a 1D array stars of size n to store the initial brightness of each star.

For each view, iterate over all stars and add their initial brightness to dp[view][t]. If the total brightness exceeds c, set it to c.

Finally, return the total brightness for each view in the output.
