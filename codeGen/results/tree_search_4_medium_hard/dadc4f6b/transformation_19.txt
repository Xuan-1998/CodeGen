===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming with memoization:
For each query, calculate the total brightness for the given rectangular view and store these values in a memoized table. This allows you to avoid recalculating the same value multiple times.

A state consists of two indices i and j indicating which stars are currently within the rectangular view.

State: (i, j), where:
  - i is the index of the leftmost star that has not been covered by the current view
  - j is the index of the topmost star that has not been covered by the current view

Transition relationship:
  - The state transitions when a new line segment is added to the view. This can be done by checking if any stars in the new line segment are within the current view.

Calculate the total brightness for each query using dynamic programming with memoization, where:
  - The state is (i, j) representing which stars are currently within the rectangular view
  - The transition relationship is the addition of new line segments to the view

Memoize the total brightness values in a table dp[][].
For each query:
  - Initialize i and j as the indices of the leftmost and topmost stars that are initially within the view.
  - Calculate the total brightness by iterating through all stars within the view, updating i and j accordingly.
  - Store the calculated total brightness value in dp[i][j].
  - Return the stored value.
