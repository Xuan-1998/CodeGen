===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the total brightness of stars within a rectangle can be broken down into smaller rectangles. We will use dynamic programming with tabulation by iterating over all possible views and calculating the total brightness for each view.

State: dp[t][x1][y1][x2][y2], where (x1, y1) is the lower left corner and (x2, y2) is the upper right corner of the rectangle at time t. This state represents the total brightness within the given rectangle at time t.

Memoization: Define a function to calculate the total brightness for a given state dp[t][x1][y1][x2][y2] and use memoization to avoid redundant calculations. This can be achieved by initializing an array of size 10^5 * 101 * 101 * 101 * 101 filled with -1 and updating it as we calculate the total brightness for each state.

The function would iterate over all stars within the given rectangle, calculate their initial brightness at time t, and add it to the total brightness. The function should return the total brightness at time t.

The main function would iterate over all views and call the dp function for each view, using memoization to avoid redundant calculations. This way, we can efficiently calculate the total brightness for each view without recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.

Finally, print out the total brightness for each view as the output.
