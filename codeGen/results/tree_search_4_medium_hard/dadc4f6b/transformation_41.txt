===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the total brightness of stars within a rectangle can be broken down into smaller rectangles. Use dynamic programming with tabulation by iterating over all possible views and calculating the total brightness for each view.

Another option is to consider a tuple (x1, y1, x2, y2) defining the coordinates of the viewed rectangle and its corresponding time t.
The state is the viewed rectangle's coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2) and time t. The transition relationship is based on iterating over all possible views and calculating the total brightness for each view.

Use a 3D array to store the maximum brightness of stars within each rectangle at different times, where the state is the coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2) and time t.

Iterate over all rectangles, and for each rectangle, iterate over all times from the start time to the end time. Calculate the total brightness of stars within the current rectangle at the current time.

The transition relationship can be updated as follows: 

* For a new view (x1, y1, x2, y2) at time t, calculate the total brightness of stars within this rectangle.
* The maximum brightness is the maximum between the previous maximum and the current brightness.

The plan includes edge cases:
- Start and end times: Ensure that the start and end times are calculated correctly to avoid out-of-range errors.
- Rectangle coordinates: Verify that the rectangle coordinates are within the valid range.
- Initial brightness: Confirm that the initial brightness values are within the correct range.

This plan can be improved by using a more efficient data structure or optimizing the calculation of total brightness for each view. However, this basic approach seems to be correct and covers most edge cases.
