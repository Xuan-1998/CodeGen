===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the total brightness of stars within a rectangle can be broken down into smaller rectangles. 
Use dynamic programming with tabulation by iterating over all possible views and calculating the total brightness for each view.

1. Initialize a 2D array dp of size (100+1) x (100+1) filled with zeros, where dp[i][j] represents the total brightness at time t=0 for a rectangle with lower left corner at (i, j).

2. Iterate over all stars and update the dp array accordingly. For each star at position (x_i, y_i), consider the number of stars that fall completely within the current rectangle, as well as those that overlap with its boundaries.

3. Use memoization to store the calculated brightness values for each view and reuse them when needed, rather than recalculating them every time.

4. Finally, iterate over all views and calculate the total brightness by summing up the dp values for the rectangles corresponding to each view.
