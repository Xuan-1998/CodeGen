===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using Dynamic Programming:
1.. Initialize a 2D array dp with dimensions (10^9 + 1) x (101 x 101). This will store the total brightness for each star at each time step.
2. For each query, calculate the total brightness for the given rectangular view and update dp accordingly.
3. Use a separate 2D array stars to store the initial brightnesses of the stars.
4. Initialize an empty map memo to store previously computed values.
5. Iterate through each star's initial brightness and position in the input.
6. For each star, iterate from its initial time to the maximum possible time (10^9).
7. Calculate the total brightness for this star at this time using dp and update it accordingly.
8. Store the updated dp value in memo for future reference.
9. Iterate through each query's rectangular view and calculate the total brightness for this view.
10. Use memo to look up previously computed values and avoid recalculating them.
