// BEGIN PLAN
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the total brightness of stars within a rectangle can be broken down into smaller rectangles. Use dynamic programming with tabulation by iterating over all possible views and calculating the total brightness for each view.

state expression: time t, representing the current moment of interest.
state represents a valid view rectangle within the given time frame.
transition relationships can be defined by iterating over all possible views.

iterate over all possible views:
    - initialize dp array with zeros
    - iterate over all stars and calculate their brightness at each time step
    - for each star, calculate its contribution to the total brightness within the current view
    - update dp array with the maximum total brightness seen so far

// END PLAN
