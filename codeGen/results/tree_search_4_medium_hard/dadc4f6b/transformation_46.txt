===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the total brightness of stars within a rectangle can be broken down into smaller rectangles.

Use dynamic programming with tabulation by iterating over all possible views and calculating the total brightness for each view.

Consider a tuple (x1, y1, x2, y2) defining the coordinates of the viewed rectangle and its corresponding time t. 

To calculate the total brightness of stars within a given rectangle at a given time:

    1. Initialize an empty table dp with dimensions (c+1) * (10001*10001)
    2. Iterate over all possible views:
        - For each view, iterate over all stars that are within the view and calculate their initial brightness
        - Update the total brightness for the current rectangle based on the initial brightness of the stars and their position within the rectangle
        - Store the updated total brightness in dp

Tabulating the calculation of the initial brightness of stars within a rectangle at a given time:

    1. Initialize an empty table sdp with dimensions (c+1) * (10001*10001)
    2. Iterate over all possible views:
        - For each view, calculate the initial brightness for each star that is within the view
        - Update the initial brightness for the current rectangle based on the position of the stars and their initial brightness
        - Store the updated initial brightness in sdp
