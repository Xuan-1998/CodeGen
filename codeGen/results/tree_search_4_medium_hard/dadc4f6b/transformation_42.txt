===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the total brightness of stars within a rectangle can be broken down into smaller rectangles. 
Use dynamic programming with tabulation by iterating over all possible views and calculating the total brightness for each view.

Create a dictionary, dp, to store the total brightness for each unique rectangle-coordinate pair, using memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
Let the state be (x1, y1, x2, y2) defining the coordinates of the viewed rectangle and its corresponding time t. 
The transition relationship is based on iterating over all possible views and calculating the total brightness for each view.

For a given view, iterate over all stars within the view's bounds and add their initial brightness to the total if they are visible.
If a star is not visible due to its y-coordinate being outside the view's top and bottom boundaries or its x-coordinate being outside the view's left and right boundaries, ignore it.
Add 1 to the time for each step of time passed since the last update. 
Update dp[(x1, y1, x2, y2)] with the total brightness calculated from the current view.

To query the total brightness for a given view, simply return dp[(x1, y1, x2, y2)].
