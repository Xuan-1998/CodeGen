The potential issues with the plan are:

* The current plan assumes that the input is valid and doesn't handle edge cases. It's necessary to add checks to ensure that the input is within the specified constraints.
* The plan doesn't consider the visibility of stars at different times. It's necessary to update the state considering the visibility of stars at each time step.
