The subproblems are based on a rectangle view, considering overlapping views in terms of their coordinates. One possible approach is to use dynamic programming with memoization.

The state is a tuple (t, r) where t is the time and r is a set of rectangles viewed up to that time, with the base case being when there are no views left.

Consider a state (t, r) where t is the time and r is the set of rectangles viewed up to that time. The next state would be (t+1, r') where r' is the updated set of rectangles considering the current rectangle's visibility at time t+1.

Utilizing a 2D table with a nested loop for memoization:

* Initialize dp_table as an array of size (q + 1) x (c + 1)
* Fill dp_table by iterating over each view from left to right
    * For each view, iterate over each rectangle in the view
        * If the rectangle is visible at time t, add its brightness to the current state
        * Update r' as the updated set of rectangles considering the current rectangle's visibility
* Return dp_table[q][c] as the total brightness of stars in the given rectangular view at a given time

This plan seems correct and should work well for this problem. To improve it, you could optimize the nested loop by using a more efficient data structure to store the rectangles or by reducing the number of iterations.
