===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the total brightness of stars within a rectangle can be broken down into smaller rectangles. Use dynamic programming with tabulation by iterating over all possible views and calculating the total brightness for each view.

The state expression could be the time t, representing the current moment of interest.
State: (t, x), where x is the x-coordinate of the viewed rectangle at time t, and the total brightness is calculated based on the stars within this slice.

Dynamic programming with a 2D table dp[t][x] to store the total brightness for each point (t, x) in the rectangle at time t.
Initialize dp[0][i] = 0 for all i; since there are no stars initially.
For each star (xi, yi), add its initial brightness s_i to dp[0][xi] and update dp[t][x] as follows:
    For each point (t, x) in the rectangle at time t:
        If xi <= x and yi >= y1i and yi <= y2i, add s_i to dp[t][x].
        Update dp[t][x] = max(dp[t][x], dp[t-1][xi]) for all i.
Return dp[q-1][x2]; this is the total brightness of stars in the q-th view at time t=q.

This plan correctly identifies the optimal substructure and uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It also considers edge cases, such as initializing the dynamic programming table with a value that represents the absence of stars initially.
