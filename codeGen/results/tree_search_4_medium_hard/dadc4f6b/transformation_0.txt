===BEGIN PLAN===
The subproblems are based on a rectangle view, considering overlapping views in terms of their coordinates. One possible approach is to use dynamic programming with memoization.

The state is a pair (t, r) where t is the time and r is a set of rectangles viewed up to that time, with the base case being when there are no views left.

Consider a state (t, r) where t is the time and r is the set of rectangles viewed up to that time. The next state would be (t+1, r') where r' is the updated set of rectangles considering the current rectangle's visibility at time t+1.

Using a dictionary to store and update dynamic programming states.

When calculating the brightness for each view, consider only the stars that are fully or partially visible in that view. This can be done by iterating through the stars and checking if their coordinates fall within the boundaries of the view.

The base case is when there are no more views left (q == 0). In this case, return a list of zeros with length q.
