===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the total brightness of stars within a rectangle can be broken down into smaller rectangles.

// Define the state expression and transition relationships
dp = {}
for t from 1 to q:
    for x1, y1, x2, y2 in views:
        // Calculate the total brightness for each view at time t
        dp[t] = (dp[t-1] if t > 0 else 0) + sum(s_i for i in range(n) 
            if min(x1, y1) <= x_i < max(x2, y2) and min(y1, x1) <= y_i < max(y2, x2) 
            and abs(t - s_i / c) % c < c)

// Apply memoization by storing previously calculated values
dp = {0: 0} # Base case for time t=0
