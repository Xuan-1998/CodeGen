===BEGIN PLAN===
The subproblems are based on a rectangle view, considering overlapping views in terms of their coordinates. One possible approach is to use dynamic programming with memoization.

Let's define the state as a tuple (t, r) where t is the time and r is a set of rectangles viewed up to that time. The base case would be when there are no views left.
We can iterate through each view, and for each view, calculate the total brightness considering all previous views and add it to the current state.

Let's use a dictionary to store the DP states where keys are tuples of (t, r) and values are the corresponding total brightness. This way, we avoid recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.

The transition from one state to another would be as follows: for each rectangle in the view, check if it overlaps with any previously viewed rectangles. If it does, then add its area to the current total brightness and update the state accordingly.
If it doesn't overlap with any previously viewed rectangles, then simply add its initial brightness to the current total brightness.

Finally, we can use this DP solution to find the total brightness for each view in the given time interval. This way, we ensure that we only consider the rectangles that are actually visible at a particular time.
