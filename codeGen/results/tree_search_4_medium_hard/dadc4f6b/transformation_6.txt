===BEGIN PLAN===
The subproblems are based on a rectangle view, considering overlapping views in terms of their coordinates. One possible approach is to use dynamic programming with memoization.

The state is a tuple (t, r) where t is the time and r is a set of rectangles viewed up to that time, with the base case being when there are no views left.
The transition function can be defined as:
- For each rectangle view at time t, calculate its brightness by summing up the initial brightness of all stars within the view.
- If the current star's visibility is not affected by the new view (i.e., it was visible before and still is), then add its brightness to the total.
- If the current star's visibility is now hidden due to the new view, remove its brightness from the total.

The dynamic programming array dp can be a 2D array with dimensions [t_max + 1] x [r_max + 1], where t_max and r_max are the maximum time and number of rectangles respectively.
dp[t][r] represents the total brightness at time t considering all rectangle views up to r.

The base case is when there are no more views left (i.e., r = 0). In this case, dp[t][0] represents the initial brightness, which is simply the sum of all stars' initial brightnesses.

The recursive formula can be written as:
dp[t][r] = dp[t-1][r-1] + sum(brightness of visible stars at time t)

Finally, we return dp[q][n-1], where q is the last view and n is the total number of rectangles.
