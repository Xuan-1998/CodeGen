===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure lies in the fact that the total brightness of stars within a rectangle can be broken down into smaller rectangles. Use dynamic programming with tabulation by iterating over all possible views and calculating the total brightness for each view.

Define a 2D table dp[i][j] to store the total brightness of stars within the view defined by (0, 0) to (i, j).

Base case: when there are no stars in the view, i.e., all star positions fall outside the rectangle. In this case, dp[i][j] = 0.

Initialization: dp[0][0] = 0.

For each pair of coordinates (x1i, y1i) and (x2i, yi), calculate the total brightness of stars within the view defined by (x1i, y1i) to (x2i, yi).

Iterate over all possible views and for each view, iterate over all stars that fall within the view. If a star's initial brightness is less than or equal to c, add its initial brightness to dp[i][j].

For each pair of coordinates, check if any star positions overlap with the rectangle boundaries. If they do, update the total brightness accordingly.

Update dp[i+1][j+1] using the base case and previous calculations.

Return dp[n-1][m-1], where n and m are the maximum number of stars in a row or column.
