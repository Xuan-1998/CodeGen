dp_state:
Let dp[x] be the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n.

Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation:

1. Define base cases: dp[0], ..., dp[9] = 0 (no operations needed for single-digit numbers)
2. Initialize a dictionary memo: memo = {i: float('inf') for i in range(10)}

3. Recursively fill up the dictionary:
    For x from 10 to the desired value:
        Calculate min_ops(x) = 
            min(min_ops(d * 10 + (x % 10)) + (x > 9), dp[x % 10] + 1)
        Update memo: memo[x] = min(memo[x], min_ops(x))
4. For n from the desired value down to 2:
    Calculate dp[n] by looking up the minimum number of operations required for x = 10^(n-1) in the dictionary

Combine memoization with iteration:

Initialize a dictionary memo with base cases: 
memo = {i: float('inf') for i in range(10)}

Fill up the dictionary by iterating over values of n from 2 to the desired value:
    For n from 2 to the desired value:
        dp[n] = min(dp[n-1] + 1, memo[10**(n-1)])
