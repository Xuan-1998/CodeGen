===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation:
First, use recursion to find the minimum number of operations required for small values of n, then tabulate the results and use them as lookups for larger values of n.

base_case
Define state as a pair (x, n) where x is the current value and n is the desired length.
The transition relationship can be formulated as:
    if the length of decimal representation of x is less than n,
        then try to multiply x by 0-9 and recursively calculate the minimum number of operations required for each possibility;
    otherwise, return -1 since the length cannot be increased further.

Use a dictionary-based approach to store the results of subproblems as keys and their corresponding values (minimum number of operations) as values.
Store the base cases (when x is single-digit or n is small) in the dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

For larger values of n, use the tabulated results as lookups to accelerate the calculation process.
When calculating for a new value of x and n, check if the result is already stored in the dictionary; if it is, return the cached value instead of recalculating it.

This hybrid approach should provide a good balance between exploration and exploitation.
It should be able to efficiently solve the problem for all possible values of n and x within the given constraints.
