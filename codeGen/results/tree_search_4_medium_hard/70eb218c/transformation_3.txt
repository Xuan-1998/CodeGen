===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with memoization: The optimal substructure of this problem is that the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n can be achieved by considering the last digit of x and then recursively solving for the remaining digits.

The state is a tuple (n, k) where n is the target length and k is the number of digits in the current decimal representation of x. 

The transition relationship can be formulated by considering the last digit of x and then recursively solving for the remaining digits. For example:
- If the last digit of x is 0 and k < n, (n, k) -> (n-1, k+1)
- If the last digit of x is not 0, (n, k) -> (n, k+1)

The base case is when n = k. In this case, the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n is 0.

Use a dictionary to store the computed values and look up the result for each state as needed.

For edge cases:
- If n < 2 or x >= 10^(n-1), return -1 because it's impossible to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n.
- If n == k, return 0 because the target length is already reached.
