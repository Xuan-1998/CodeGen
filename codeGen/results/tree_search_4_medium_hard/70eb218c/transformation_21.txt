===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation:
Define dp[i] as the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i.

State relationship: The last digit of x can be changed by multiplying x by 1-9. This means that for each possible last digit j, we need to consider all possibilities of how we got to this state (i.e., which digits were previously added or removed). Let's denote the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i when the last digit is j as f(i, j).

Transition relationship: If we are currently at state (i, j), then we can either keep the same last digit and decrease i by 1 (in which case we need dp[i-1] operations), or we can change the last digit to a new digit k and increase i by 1 (in which case we need f(i+1, k) operations). This means that the minimum number of operations required for state (i, j) is the minimum of these two options: min(dp[i-1], f(i+1, k)).

Base cases: dp[0] = 0 and dp[1] = 0. The minimum number of operations to make the length of decimal representation equal to 0 or 1 is 0.

Updated plan:
1. Initialize an array dp with size n + 1, where dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i.
2. For each possible last digit j from 0 to 9, calculate f(i, j) as follows:
    a. If i is 0, then f(0, j) = 0 (base case).
    b. Otherwise, consider all possibilities of how we got to this state: for each k from 1 to 9, if x * k ends with digit j and the length of decimal representation of x * k is equal to i + 1, then update f(i, j) as min(f(i, j), dp[i-1] + 1).
3. Return dp[n].

This plan considers all possible cases and avoids redundant calculations using memoization.
It also includes edge cases by handling the base cases for i = 0 and i = 1 separately.
