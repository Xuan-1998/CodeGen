===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation:
First, use recursion to find the minimum number of operations required for small values of n, then tabulate the results and use them as lookups for larger values of n.

base_case
Define the state as a tuple (n, x) where n is the desired length of decimal representation and x is the current value.
The transition relationship can be formulated as:
if the last digit of x is 0, then there's no need to perform any operation;
otherwise, consider all possible digits that can replace the last digit of x and recursively calculate the minimum number of operations required for each of those possibilities.

Implement memoization by defining a recursive function with a dictionary to store the results, then modify the function to use the stored results when possible.
Use a bottom-up tabulation approach to precompute and store the results for smaller values of n, then use these lookups as references for larger values of n.
Incorporate an edge case to handle the situation where it is impossible to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n.

The plan looks correct, but here's a potential improvement:
Instead of using recursion and memoization, consider using dynamic programming with tabulation.
This can be more efficient for larger values of n because it avoids the overhead of function calls and returns.
The updated plan is as follows:
