===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation:
 Define dp[i] as the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i.

dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x's last i digits equal to i.

Formulate state and transition relationships based on the fact that the last digit of x can be changed by multiplying x by 1-9.

Initialize dp array with all values as infinity or -1, depending on whether we want to handle impossible cases.

dp[0] should be set to 0, since making the length equal to 0 doesn't require any operations. Then recursively calculate dp[i] for i > 0:

If x is less than 10^(i-1), then it is possible to make its length equal to i by simply adding leading zeros.
Set dp[i] as the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x's last (i-1) digits equal to (i-1).

Otherwise, if x is greater or equal to 10^(i-1), then we can change its last digit and recursively calculate dp[i].

Update dp[i] as the minimum between dp[i] and 1 plus the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x's last (i-1) digits equal to (i-1).

Calculate dp[n] where n is the desired length, and return it as the answer.

If the desired length is not achievable, set the answer as -1.
