===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation:
Define dp[i] as the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i.

dp[i] can be calculated recursively based on dp[j], where j is the last digit of x.
For each possible last digit of x, compute the minimum number of operations by multiplying x by 1-9 and then adding the number of digits added in the multiplication.

The state transition relationships are:
- If the length of decimal representation of x is already i, dp[i] = 0 (base case).
- Otherwise, dp[i] is the minimum of dp[j] + 1, where j is the last digit of x, and considering all possible values for x's last digit.

The transition function can be formalized as follows:
dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1) for j = 0 to 9

The edge cases are handled by setting dp[1] = 0 (since one-digit numbers have no operations), and ensuring that the base case is correctly implemented.
