===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation:
Define dp[i] as the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i.

dp[0] is initialized as 0, since it's always possible to represent 0 as an empty string.
For each i from 1 to n (inclusive):
    dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + 1, dp[max(0, floor(log10(x)))])
        where max(0, floor(log10(x))) is the maximum digit that can be added to x without changing its length.
    Iterate through all digits d from 1 to 9:
        if x % 10 == d:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[max(0, i-1)] + 1)
        else:
            x *= d
            dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + 1, dp[max(0, floor(log10(x)))])
    Update x to its decimal representation.
