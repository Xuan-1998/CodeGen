===BEGIN PLAN===
dp_state:
Let dp[n][x] be the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n. Then:

- For each digit d in the decimal representation of x, update dp[n][x] to be the minimum of its current value and 1 plus the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of dx equal to n.
- Base case: If the length of decimal representation of x is already n or more, then return 0 as no operation is needed.

Initialization:
dp[n][i] = âˆž for all i in range(1, 10^(n-1)).

Main loop:
For each x from 1 to 10^(n-1):
    For each digit d in the decimal representation of x:
        Update dp[n][x] to be the minimum of its current value and 1 plus the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of dx equal to n.
    If the length of decimal representation of x is already n or more, then return 0 as no operation is needed.

Return:
The minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of any given integer x equal to n, which is dp[n][x].
