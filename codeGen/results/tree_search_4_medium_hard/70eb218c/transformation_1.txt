===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with memoization: The optimal substructure of this problem is that the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n can be achieved by considering the digits of x from left to right. You can use memoization to avoid redundant computations.

The state is a tuple (n, k), where n is the target length and k is the current length of x.
State: (n, k) represents the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of a number with k digits equal to n by performing at most k-1 operations.

Memoize the dynamic programming function by storing the results in a dictionary where the key is a tuple (n, k) and the value is the minimum number of operations.
Base case: If x has less than n digits, return -1 as it's impossible to make the length equal to n. Otherwise, consider the last digit of x:
- If the last digit is not 0 and n >= len(str(x)), you can perform an operation by replacing x with x * (last digit), then recursively solve for the remaining k-1 digits.
- If the last digit is 0 or n < len(str(x)), you can't perform any operations, so return -1.
Memoize the results of these recursive calls and store them in a dictionary.
