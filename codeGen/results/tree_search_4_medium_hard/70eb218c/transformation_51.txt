1. Initialize an empty memoization table dp with dimensions (n+1) x 10 and fill it with infinity values for all n and initial digits.
2. Define base cases for states where n is 0 or less, returning 0 if the current digit is 0, -1 otherwise.
3. Define a state transition function that calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n:
   - If the remaining length (n) is 0, return the current number of operations for this digit.
   - If the remaining length (n) is greater than the current digit's value, increment the current number of operations by the difference between n and the current digit's value, then decrement the remaining length to be equal to the current digit's value.
   - Otherwise, calculate the minimum number of operations required for this state by considering two options: adding a new digit (incrementing the current number of operations) or removing the last digit (decrementing the current number of operations and decreasing n).
4. Implement memoization by filling up the dp table from scratch using previously computed values as lookups.
5. Calculate the minimum number of operations required for the given initial state x with n, using the dp table as a lookup table for smaller subproblems.

Note: The plan includes edge cases where n is 0 or less, and it takes into account all possible transitions. However, you should be aware that some states might not have a valid solution if it's impossible to make the length of decimal representation equal to n. In such cases, return -1.
