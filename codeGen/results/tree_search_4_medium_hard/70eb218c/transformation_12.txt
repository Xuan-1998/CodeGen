===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i when the last digit is j.

The state transition can be described as follows:
- If n = 1, return 0
- If d < 10^(n-1), return -1 (as it's impossible to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n)
- Otherwise, consider the options to make the last digit d zero by multiplying x by some digit y:
    * For each possible y in the range [0, 9], calculate dp[n-1][y] + 1 (as we need one more operation to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n)
    * Return the minimum value among these options

The base case is when n = 1, as there's no need for operations to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to 1.

To avoid redundant computations, you can fill up the table in a bottom-up manner from smaller values of n to larger ones.
