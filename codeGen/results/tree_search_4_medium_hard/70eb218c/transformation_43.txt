===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation:
First, use recursion to find the minimum number of operations required for small values of n, then tabulate the results and use them as lookups for larger values of n.

base_case
Define state as a pair (x, n) where x is the current value and n is the desired length.
The transition relationship can be formulated as: 
  - If the length of decimal representation of x is less than n, then try to multiply x by 0-9 and recursively calculate the minimum number of operations required for each possibility;
  - Otherwise, return -1 since the length cannot be increased further.

Create a dictionary where the keys are tuples representing the state (x, n) and the values are the corresponding minimum number of operations.
Use this dictionary as a memo to store and look up previously computed results.

Pre-compute base cases: For small values of n (e.g., 2-5), use the plan above to calculate the minimum number of operations required for each value of x, then tabulate these results in the memo dictionary. This will serve as a lookup table for larger values of n.

Use the memoized values to solve the problem:
For given values of n and x, use the memoization to find the minimum number of operations required.
If the desired length n is greater than 19 or less than 2, return -1 (as per the constraints).
