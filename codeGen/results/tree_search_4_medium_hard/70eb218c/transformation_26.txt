===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation:

Define dp_state:
dp[0][x] as 0, since it is impossible to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to 0.

For each i > 0 and each x:
- If the length of decimal representation of x is already i, define dp[i][x] as 0.
- Otherwise, consider the last digit d in the decimal representation of x. There are two cases:
    - If d < 10, define dp[i][x] as the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x * d equal to i.
    - If d >= 10, define dp[i][x] as the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x / d equal to i.

Use recursive function calls with memoization to precompute a dictionary that maps small values of n to their corresponding minimum number of operations. This dictionary can be used as lookups for larger values of n.

Store the results in a 2D array dp[][] where dp[i][x] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i.

Finally, use this 2D array as lookups to find the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n.
