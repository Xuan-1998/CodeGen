===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation:
First, use recursion to find the minimum number of operations required for small values of n, then tabulate the results and use them as lookups for larger values of n.

base_case
Define state as a pair (x, n) where x is the current value and n is the desired length. The transition relationship can be formulated as:
if the length of decimal representation of x is less than n, 
  then try to multiply x by 0-9 and recursively calculate the minimum number of operations required for each possibility; 
  otherwise, return -1 since the length cannot be increased further.

Employ a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of i equal to j. The base case is when n = 1, in which case we can simply return the number of digits in x as the minimum number of operations required.
The recursive relationship can be formulated as:
dp[x][n] = min(dp[10*y][n-1] + 1 for y in range(0, 10)) if x < 10^(n-1) else -1

Employ a bottom-up approach to fill the dp table by iterating from n=1 to 19 and from x=1 to 10^(n-1). Then, use this table as a lookup when calculating the result for larger values of n.
