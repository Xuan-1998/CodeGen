===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach with memoization: The optimal substructure of this problem is that the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n can be achieved by considering the last digit of x and then recursively solving for the remaining digits. You can use memoization to avoid redundant computations.

The state is a tuple (x, n), where x is the current number and n is the target length.
You can define the state as (n, k) where n is the target length and k is the number of digits in the current decimal representation of x. The transition relationship can be formulated by considering the last digit of x and then recursively solving for the remaining digits.

For example: (n, k) -> (n-1, k-1) if the last digit of x is 0; (n, k) -> (n, k-1) if the last digit of x is not 0. This process can be repeated until n reaches 2.

Create a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i when the current number has j digits.

Initialize dp[0][j] for all j as -1, since it is impossible to achieve a length of 0. 

Then, iterate from n down to 2 and for each k, calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i when the current number has k digits.

For example: dp[i][k] = min(dp[i-1][k-1], dp[i][k-1]) + 1 if the last digit of x is 0; dp[i][k] = dp[i][k-1] if the last digit of x is not 0. 

Finally, return dp[n][k].
