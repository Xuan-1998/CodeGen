===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a top-down recursive approach with memoization:
The optimal substructure of this problem is that the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n can be achieved by considering the last digit of x and then recursively solving for the remaining digits.
You can use memoization to avoid redundant computations.

State: A tuple (x, n), where x is the current number and n is the target length.

Transition relationship:
(x, n) -> ((10*x + d), n-1) if the last digit of x is not 0; 
(x, n) -> (-1) if it's impossible to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n.

Use a dictionary-based memoization approach to store the computed values and avoid redundant computations.

Memoization:
Maintain a dictionary dp where dp[(x, n)] = min_operations. Initialize dp with default value infinity for all states (x, n).

Base case: 
dp[(0, n)] = 0 if n >= 1; otherwise, return -1.
dp[(10**n, n)] = 0.

Recursive case:
If the last digit of x is not 0, then consider two options: multiply by 2 or add 1 to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n. 
Choose the option that requires fewer operations and update dp accordingly.
If it's impossible to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n, return -1.

Main function:
Take input (n, x) from standard input, compute the minimum number of operations using memoization, and print the result to standard output.
