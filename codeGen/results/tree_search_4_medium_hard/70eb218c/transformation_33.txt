===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation: First, use recursion to find the minimum number of operations required for small values of n, then tabulate the results and use them as lookups for larger values of n.

Let dp[i] be the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i. The state is dp[i], which can range from 1 to n.

dp[i] = 
    dp[min(i-1, len(str(x))-1)] + 1 if x // 10**(i-1) == 0 else
    min(dp[j] + (i-j-1) + (x // 10**j != 0)) for i in range(2, n+1)

Use dynamic programming by initializing an array dp[0..n] with initial conditions and then iteratively update each state using previously computed states.

Initialize dp[0..n] with initial condition: dp[i] = -1 for all i in range(n+1), since it's impossible to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to 0

Main loop:
for i from n downto 2:
    for j from min(i-1, len(str(x))-1) downto 1:
        if x // 10**(j-1) == 0:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j-1] + 1)
        else:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j-1] + (i-j-1) + (x // 10**j != 0))

Return the value of dp[n]
