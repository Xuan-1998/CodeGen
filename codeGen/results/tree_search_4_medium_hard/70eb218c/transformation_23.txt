===BEGIN PLAN===
Create a state variable dp[i][x] to represent the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i.

Top-down recursive memoization:
1. Define a function f(i, x) that returns the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i.
2. Base case: if the length of decimal representation of x is already equal to i, return 0.
3. Recursive case: try multiplying x by each digit y in its decimal representation, and recursively call f(i-1, xy) for each possible multiplication. Return the minimum number of operations found among these recursive calls.
4. Memoization: store the results of f(i, x) in a dictionary dp[i][x] to avoid redundant computation.

Bottom-up tabulation:
1. Initialize an empty table dp with dimensions (n+1) x (10^(n-1)).
2. Fill the table row by row, starting from the bottom: for each i and x, compute f(i, x) using the memoized function and store the result in dp[i][x].
3. Use the precomputed values in dp to solve larger instances of the problem.

Edge cases:
1. Handle the case where n is 2 (the minimum possible value). For x = 0, return 1 (since the length of decimal representation of 0 is 1).
2. Handle the case where n is 2 and x > 0. Return -1, since it's impossible to make the length of decimal representation of a positive integer less than 10 equal to 2.
3. Handle the case where n = 19 (the maximum possible value). For x in [1, 9], return -1, since it's impossible to make the length of decimal representation of an integer less than 10^18 equal to 19.
