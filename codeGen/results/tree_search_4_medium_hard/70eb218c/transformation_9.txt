===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with memoization: The optimal substructure of this problem is that the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n can be achieved by considering the last digit of x and then recursively solving for the remaining digits. You can use memoization to avoid redundant computations.

The state is a tuple (x, n), where x is the current number and n is the target length. 
You can define the state as (k, l) where k is the number of digits in the current decimal representation of x and l is the target length.
The transition relationship can be formulated by considering the last digit of x and then recursively solving for the remaining digits.

For example: (0, l) -> (-1) if it's impossible to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to l;
(k+1, l) -> (10*x % 10 + d, l-1) if the last digit of x is not 0;

Consider using a dynamic programming table with O(n) rows and O(log n) columns to store the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of x, where n is the target length.

To improve the plan, you can consider the following:
- Handle edge cases such as when it's impossible to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n.
- Consider optimizing the dynamic programming table size by using a more efficient data structure or compression technique.

The plan includes edge cases: It handles the case where it's impossible to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n by returning -1.
