===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation: First, use recursion to find the minimum number of operations required for small values of n, then tabulate the results and use them as lookups for larger values of n.

For x = 10^(i-1), the minimum number of operations is always i. This serves as a base case.

A dynamic programming approach could be used where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i when x is j digits long.
Implement tabulation with a 2D table where:
    - For i = 1, dp[i][x] = i if x >= 10^(i-1) (the base case), otherwise -1
    - For i > 1, 
        + If x < 10^i, use the base case dp[i-1][x]
        + Otherwise, consider two possibilities: either x is multiplied by a single digit y to make it in the range [10^(i-1), 10^i) or x is already in this range
            - For the first possibility, try all possible values of y and update dp[i][x] with the minimum number of operations required for the new value of x
            - If none of the above works (i.e., x is not in the range [10^(i-1), 10^i)), return -1

Tabulate the results for all possible values of i and j, then use these lookups to find the minimum number of operations required for larger values of n.
