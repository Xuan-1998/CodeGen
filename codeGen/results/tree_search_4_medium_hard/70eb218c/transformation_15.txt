===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation:
Define dp[i] as the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i.

Formulate state and transition relationships based on the fact that the last digit of x can be changed by multiplying x by 1-9. The state is the current length of decimal representation, and the transitions are the possible changes in the last digit.
Use memoization by defining a function that takes x and n as inputs and returns the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n, and then store the results of subproblems in a dictionary.

For each i from 1 to n:
    - If the length of decimal representation of x is already i, return 0 (no operations needed)
    - Otherwise, iterate over all possible last digits y that could make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i
        - For each y, calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i by multiplying x by a power of 10 with last digit y
        - Store the result in dp[i]
    - Return dp[n]
