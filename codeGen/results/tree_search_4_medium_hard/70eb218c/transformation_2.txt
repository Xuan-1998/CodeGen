===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a top-down recursive approach with memoization: The optimal substructure of this problem is that the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n can be achieved by considering the last digit of x and then recursively solving for the remaining digits. You can use memoization to avoid redundant computations.

The state is a tuple (n, len(str(x))), where n is the target length and len(str(x)) is the current length of x.
State: (n, k) represents the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation equal to n for the last k digits of x.

Implement memoization using a two-dimensional list dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation equal to i for the last j digits of x.

To avoid redundant computation, initialize dp with -1 and update it as follows:

- If n is less than or equal to k, return 0 (no operation needed)
- If k is 0, return -1 (it's impossible to make the length equal to n)

Update dp[i][j] by considering all possible last digits for x. For each digit d from 0 to 9:

- Calculate the new length of decimal representation if x is multiplied by 10d
- If this new length is less than or equal to i, update dp[i][j] with the minimum between its current value and dp[i-new_length][j-1] + 1

Finally, return dp[n][len(str(x))]
