1. Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation:
    - Start by using recursion to find the minimum number of operations required for small values of n (e.g., 2-5).
    - Once the base cases are covered, transition to bottom-up tabulation to fill in the rest of the table.
2. For x = 10^(i-1), the minimum number of operations is always i:
    - This simplification can be used as a base case for the recursive function or as an initialization value for the dynamic programming table.
3. Define a state as a pair (n, d) where d is the current digit of x and n is the remaining length:
    - The transition would be from one state to another by either adding a new digit or removing the last digit.
4. Use dynamic programming with a 2D table to store the minimum number of operations for each (n, x) pair:
    - Initialize the table with base cases (e.g., small values of n).
    - Fill in the rest of the table by iteratively considering all possible transitions from one state to another.
5. Use memoization to avoid redundant computation and speed up the process:
    - Store previously computed results in a cache or lookup table for faster retrieval.
6. Handle edge cases:
    - For x = 1, the minimum number of operations is always 0 (since there's no need to perform any operations).
    - For n = 1, the minimum number of operations is also always 0 (since there's only one digit to consider).
7. Refine the plan as needed:
    - Analyze the performance and correctness of the plan.
    - Consider optimizations or alternative approaches if the original plan doesn't yield the desired results.
