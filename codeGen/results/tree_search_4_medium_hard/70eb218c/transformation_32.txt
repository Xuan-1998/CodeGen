===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation: First, use recursion to find the minimum number of operations required for small values of n, then tabulate the results and use them as lookups for larger values of n.

Let dp[i] be the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i. The state is dp[i], which can range from 1 to n.
dp[1] = len(str(x))
for i in range(2, n+1):
    dp[i] = min(dp[j] + (i-j-1) + (x // 10**j != 0)) for j in range(min(i-1, len(str(x))-1), i)

Use a recursive function with memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.
