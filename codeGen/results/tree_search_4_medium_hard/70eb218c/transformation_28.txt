===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation:

dp_state
Define dp[i][x] as 0 if i is less than 1 (since it is impossible to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to a negative value), and then for each i >= 1 and each x, define dp[i][x] as the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i.

Create a recursive function that calls itself with smaller values of n until it reaches a base case (i.e., when the length of decimal representation of x is less than or equal to 1), and then use a dictionary to store the results for future lookups. 

For each operation, if the last digit of x is 0, consider removing the trailing zeros; otherwise, multiply x by the smallest non-zero digit (i.e., 1) to make it grow.
