===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation:

dp_state
Create a state variable dp[i][x] to represent the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i.

Use a 2D list to implement tabulation, where dp[i][x] represents the minimum number of operations required for x with decimal representation length i.
Fill in dp[0][x] base cases: When n = 1, the minimum number of operations is simply the number of digits in the decimal representation of x.
For larger values of n, use recursion to fill in the dp table. The minimum number of operations is either:
    - 1 plus the minimum number of operations required for the number obtained by removing the most significant digit from the decimal representation of x
    - 1 plus the minimum number of operations required for the number obtained by multiplying the most significant digit from the decimal representation of x with itself

Tabulate the results and use them as lookups for larger values of n.

Edge cases:
- For x = 0, return 0 because there are no digits in its decimal representation.
- For n > log10(x) + 1, return -1 because it is impossible to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n.
