===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation:
1. **Base Case:** For x = 10^(i-1), the minimum number of operations is always i, since adding one more digit to x would make its length equal to i.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table (dp):** Create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of j equal to i.
3. **Bottom-up Tabulation:** Fill in the dp table row by row, starting from the base case (i=1). For each value of i, calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of j equal to i for all j from 1 to 10^(i-1).
4. **Top-down Recursive Memoization:** Use the precomputed dp table values as lookups for larger values of n.
5. **Final Answer:** For a given input (n, x), check if x's decimal representation is already i digits long. If not, find the minimum number of operations required to make it i digits long using the precomputed dp table values.
