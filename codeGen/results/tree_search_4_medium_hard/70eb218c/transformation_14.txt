===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation:
Define dp[i] as the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i.

Formulate state and transition relationships based on the fact that the last digit of x can be changed by multiplying x by 1-9. 
dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i.

To implement dynamic programming using a bottom-up approach with tabulation:
Fill in dp[i]'s value based on the previous values and the state transition equation.
Calculate dp[i] by considering the last digit of x and its corresponding multiplication factor. 
dp[i-1] + 1 if the last digit can be changed to make it equal to i; otherwise, return -1.

The plan covers all cases:
- It handles edge cases where n is 2 (e.g., x = 9) or when the length of decimal representation of x is already n.
- It includes the base case dp[0] = 0 for the initial state.

Some potential issues with this plan are:
- What if there's no way to make the length of decimal representation equal to i? The plan does not explicitly handle this edge case. 
- How do we ensure that we don't count unnecessary operations?

To improve this plan, consider adding a check after calculating dp[i] to see if it is indeed possible to make the length of decimal representation equal to i. If not, return -1.

Here's an updated version:
