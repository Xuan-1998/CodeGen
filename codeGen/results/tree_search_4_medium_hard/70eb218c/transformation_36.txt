===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation:

base_case
Define the state as a tuple (n, x) where n is the desired length of decimal representation and x is the current value.

Transition Relationship:
1. Define the state space: Let S = {(n, x)| 2 <= n <= 19, 1 <= x < 10^(n-1)}.
2. Initialize a 2D table dp with size |S| filled with infinity for all states (n, x).
3. Base case: If the length of decimal representation of x is already n, then there are no operations required, so dp(n, x) = 0.

Recursion:
1. Define the recursive function f(n, x):
   a. If the last digit of x is 0, there's no need to perform any operation.
   b. Otherwise, consider all possible digits that can replace the last digit of x and recursively calculate the minimum number of operations required for each of those possibilities.

Tabulation:
1. Fill the table dp using a bottom-up approach:
   a. For each state (n, x) in S:
      i. If n is 2, directly calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n.
      ii. Otherwise, find the smallest digit y that can be used to replace the last digit of x and calculate the minimum number of operations required for the new state (n-1, xy) in dp.
   b. Return dp(n, x) as the minimum number of operations required.
