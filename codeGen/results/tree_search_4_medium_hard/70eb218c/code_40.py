===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation:
base_case
Formulate state as a string representing the current decimal representation of x, and the transition relationship as:
    if the length of the current decimal representation is less than n, then try to append '0' or '1' to it and recursively calculate the minimum number of operations required;
    otherwise, return -1 since the length cannot be increased further.
Use a recursive function with a dictionary-based memoization approach, where the function calls itself with updated values and stores them in the dictionary for future reference. Fill up a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make x's decimal representation have j digits when n = i. Initialize dp[0][1] = 0 (base case: one-digit number), dp[0][k] = -1 for k > 1 (base case: cannot increase length).

For larger values of i, use the following transitions:
    if the current decimal representation has less than j digits, try to append '0' or '1' and recursively calculate the minimum number of operations required;
    otherwise, return dp[i-1][j] since the length is already at least j.
After filling up the table, the answer for n and x can be obtained by looking up dp[n-1][x]'s value. If it's -1, then it's impossible to make the decimal representation have x digits.

Here's the Python code that implements this plan:
