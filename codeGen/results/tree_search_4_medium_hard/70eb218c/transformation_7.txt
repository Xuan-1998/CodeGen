===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach: The optimal substructure of this problem is that the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n can be achieved by considering the last digit of x and then recursively solving for the remaining digits. You can use memoization to avoid redundant computations.

The state is a tuple (x, n), where x is the current number and n is the target length. 

You can define the state as (x, n) where x is the current number and n is the target length. The transition relationship can be formulated by considering the last digit of x and then recursively solving for the remaining digits. For example: 
(x, n) -> ((10*x + d), n-1) if the last digit of x is not 0; (x, n) -> (-1) if it's impossible to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n.

Implement a dynamic programming table using a list or array, where each cell represents the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n for the given state (x, n).

Base cases: 
- If n is 1, return 0 because one digit always takes at least one operation.
- If n is greater than the length of decimal representation of x, return -1 because it's impossible to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n.

Initialize a dynamic programming table with size (10^(n-1), n+1) filled with -1. 

For each cell in the dynamic programming table from left to right and top to bottom:
- If the last digit of x is 0, set dp[x][n] = dp[10*x][n-1]
- Else if it's not impossible (i.e., dp[10*x + d][n-1] != -1), set dp[x][n] = min(dp[10*x + d][n-1], dp[x][n]) + 1
- If it's impossible, set dp[x][n] = -1

Finally, return dp[x][0]
