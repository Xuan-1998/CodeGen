===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with memoization: The optimal substructure of this problem is that the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n can be achieved by considering each digit of x and then recursively solving for the remaining digits.

The state is a tuple (n, k), where n is the target length and k is the current length of x. The value dp[n][k] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n when x has k digits.

State: dp[n][0] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of 1 equal to n, which is simply n-1. This base case helps to compute all other values in the dp table.

The recurrence relation for computing dp[n][k] is as follows:
If k == 0, then return -1.
Else, find the maximum number y such that y*10^m <= x and y has m digits. This can be achieved by iterating from the most significant digit to the least significant digit of x.
For each digit d in y's decimal representation, compute dp[n][k-1-d] for all 0 <= d <= len(str(y)).
Return the minimum value plus 1.

The answer is stored in dp[target_length][len(str(x))].
