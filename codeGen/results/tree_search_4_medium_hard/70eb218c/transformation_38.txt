===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation:

**Base Case**
Formulate state as a string representing the current decimal representation of x, and the transition relationship as:
    - if the length of the current decimal representation is less than n, then try to append '0' or '1' to it and recursively calculate the minimum number of operations required;
    - otherwise, return -1 since the length cannot be increased further.

**Memoization**
Use a dictionary as a lookup table for storing and retrieving previously computed values during recursion. This will prevent redundant calculations and improve efficiency for larger values of n.

**Tabulation**
Store the results from recursive calls in the dictionary as they are computed. Then, when calculating the minimum number of operations required for larger values of n, use the stored results as lookups to avoid redundant calculations.

**Improved Plan**
To further optimize the plan:

    - Precompute a lookup table for single-digit multiplication (0-9) and store it in a dictionary.
    - Modify the transition relationship to consider multiplying x by 2 or 5 before appending '0' or '1', as these multipliers can help shorten the decimal representation more efficiently.

**Edge Cases**
Ensure that the plan handles edge cases such as:

    - n = 1: return 0 since the length of the decimal representation is already equal to n.
    - x = 0: return 0 since appending '0' or '1' does not change the length of the decimal representation.
