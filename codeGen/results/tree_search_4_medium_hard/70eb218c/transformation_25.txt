===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation:
First, use recursion to find the minimum number of operations required for small values of n, then tabulate the results and use them as lookups for larger values of n.

dp_state
Create a state variable dp[i][x] to represent the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i.
For each value of i from 2 to n:
    For each value of x from 1 to 10^(i-1):
        If the length of decimal representation of x is already i, then dp[i][x] = 0
        Else:
            Initialize min_ops = INF (or a very large number)
            For each digit d in the decimal representation of x:
                For each possible replacement y for the digit d:
                    Calculate new_x = x * y
                    Check if the length of decimal representation of new_x is i-1
                    If it is, then update min_ops with dp[i-1][new_x] + 1
            Update dp[i][x] with min_ops

Develop a hybrid approach by first implementing tabulation for small values of n and then using recursive memoization to extend the results for larger values of n.
