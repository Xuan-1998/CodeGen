===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with memoization and recursion: The optimal substructure of this problem is that the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n can be achieved by considering the last digit of x and then recursively solving for the remaining digits. You can use memoization to avoid redundant computations.

The state is a tuple (x, n), where x is the current number and n is the target length.
You can define the state as (k, l) where k is the number of digits in the current decimal representation of x and l is the target length. The transition relationship can be formulated by considering the last digit of x and then recursively solving for the remaining digits.

For example: (0, l) -> (-1) if it's impossible to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to l; 
(1, l) -> 1 + dp(10*x % 10, l-1) if the last digit of x is not 0;
(1, l) -> (l == 1 ? 0 : -1) if the last digit of x is 0 and n is 1.
You can implement memoization by creating a dictionary that maps tuples (x, n) to the minimum number of operations required.

The base case would be when the length of decimal representation of x equals n. In this case, return 0 because no operations are needed. Otherwise, try to make the last digit of x equal to 0 and recursively solve for the remaining digits.

For example: (k+1, l) -> min(1 + dp(10*x % 10, l-1), dp(x // 10, l)) if the last digit of x is not 0;
(1, l) -> (l == 1 ? 0 : -1) if the last digit of x is 0 and n is 1.
The final answer would be dp(x, n).
