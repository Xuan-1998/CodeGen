===BEGIN PLAN===
dp_state
Let dp[x] be the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n. Then, for each digit d in the decimal representation of x:
    * If x is less than 10 (one-digit), then dp[x] = 0 because no operations are needed.
    * Otherwise, update dp[x] to be the minimum of its current value and 1 plus the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of dx equal to n-1.
Use a bottom-up tabulation approach: Create an array dp[] of size 10^(n-1) initialized with infinity, then iterate over all numbers from 1 to 10^(n-1), and for each number x:
    * If the length of decimal representation of x is equal to n, set dp[x] = 0.
    * Otherwise, update dp[x] based on the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of dx equal to n-1 for all digits d in the decimal representation of x.
Finally, return dp[x].
