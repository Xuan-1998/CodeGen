===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation:
  * First, use recursion to find the minimum number of operations required for small values of n, then
    tabulate the results and use them as lookups for larger values of n.
  For x = 10^(i-1), the minimum number of operations is always i.

  A dynamic programming approach could be used where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of
  operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i when x is j
  digits long. Use top-down recursive memoization with a dictionary (memo) to store and reuse
  previously computed values, and recursively compute the minimum number of operations for each
  value of n and x.

  Initialize dp array with all values set to infinity.
  For each value of n:
    For each value of x from 10^(n-1) down to 1:
      If the length of decimal representation of x is already equal to n, return 0 (no operations
      needed).
      Else:
        Initialize min_ops = infinity and consider all possible digits d that can be appended
        to x.
        For each digit d:
          Calculate the new value of x after appending d: d * 10^(length(x)) + remainder(x)
          If this new value of x is already in memo, use the cached result for min_ops.
          Else:
            Recursively calculate the minimum number of operations needed to make the length of
            decimal representation of the new x equal to n and store it in memo.
            Add 1 to the recursive result and update min_ops.
        Return min_ops.

  If no value of x can be found that requires fewer than infinity operations, return -1.
