===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation: First, use recursion to find the minimum number of operations required for small values of n, then tabulate the results and use them as lookups for larger values of n.

1. Initialize dp[0][i] = i for all 1 <= i < 10^(n-1), since the decimal representation of x will always be at least one digit long.
2. For each i from n to 2, do:
    - Iterate j from max(10^(i-1)-1, 1) to min(10^i, 10^(n-1)) (inclusive).
    - If the length of decimal representation of j is equal to i, dp[i][j] = 0.
    - Otherwise, find the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of j equal to i, and update dp[i][j].
3. Return dp[n-1][x].

For x = 10^(i-1), the minimum number of operations is always i.
Consider using a recursive function that takes as input the current value of n and x, and returns the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n.

You can use dynamic programming by creating a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of j equal to i.
