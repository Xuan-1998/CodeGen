===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation: First, use recursion to find the minimum number of operations required for small values of n, then tabulate the results and use them as lookups for larger values of n.

base_case
Define the state as a tuple (n, x) where n is the desired length of decimal representation and x is the current value. The transition relationship can be formulated as: if the last digit of x is 0, then there's no need to perform any operation; otherwise, consider all possible digits that can replace the last digit of x and recursively calculate the minimum number of operations required for each of those possibilities.

Implement dynamic programming by defining a recursive function with a dictionary to store the results, then modify the function to use the stored results when possible and update the dictionary accordingly.

Correctness:
The plan is correct in that it outlines a hybrid approach combining top-down recursion with bottom-up tabulation. However, there are some potential issues:

* The base case is not clearly defined. What should be the initial value of n?
* The transition relationship needs to be refined to handle cases where x has more than one digit.
* There's no guarantee that the recursive function will terminate for larger values of n.

To improve the plan, consider adding a memoization table to store intermediate results and use it to avoid redundant calculations. Also, ensure that the base case is well-defined and the transition relationship handles all possible cases.

Edge Cases:
The plan should include edge cases such as:

* What if x has only one digit? Should it still be considered for operations?
* What if n is 1? Should it return -1 or 0?
