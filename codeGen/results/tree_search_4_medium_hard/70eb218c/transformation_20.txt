===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation: Define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i, considering the last digit is j. Then, formulate state and transition relationships based on the fact that the last digit of x can be changed by multiplying x by 1-9.

dp[0][j] = -1 for all j (base case: if the length of decimal representation of x is already 0, it's impossible to make it equal to i)

dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][j] + 1 for all i > 0 and j (state transition: one operation can change the last digit from j to any other digit, and then recursively calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i-1)

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + 1) for all i > 0, j, k (state transition: one operation can change the last digit from j to any other digit, and then recursively calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i-1)

Finally, return dp[n][d] where d is the last digit of x. If there's no valid solution (i.e., all values in dp are -1), output -1.
