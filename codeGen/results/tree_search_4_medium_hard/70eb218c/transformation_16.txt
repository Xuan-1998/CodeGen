===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation: Define dp[i] as the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i. Then, formulate state and transition relationships based on the fact that the last digit of x can be changed by multiplying x by 1-9.

Let's break it down step by step:

* Initialize a table dp[0..n] with all elements set to infinity (or some very large number). This represents the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to each i from 0 to n.
* For each i from 1 to n, iterate through all possible last digits y in the range [0..9]. Calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i-1 and then append y as the new last digit. This is represented by dp[i-1] + (y == x % 10 ? 0 : 1).
* Update dp[i] with the minimum value among all possible cases.
* The final answer will be dp[n].

This plan seems correct, but it can be improved by using a more efficient approach. Instead of iterating through all possible last digits y for each i, we can iterate through the decimal representation of x and update dp[i] based on the last digit of x.

Potential issues with the plan:
* Edge cases: What if x is 0? We need to handle this case separately.
* The current plan assumes that it's always possible to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i. However, there might be cases where it's impossible (e.g., when x is already in its shortest form). We should add a check to ensure that dp[i] is not negative.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
