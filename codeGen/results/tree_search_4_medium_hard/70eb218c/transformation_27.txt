dp_state:
Define dp[n][x] as the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n.

Base case: For each 0 <= i <= n and each x, define dp[i][x] as follows:

* If the length of decimal representation of x is already i, then dp[i][x] = 0.
* Otherwise, consider all possible leading digits y in the range [1..9]. 
  For each y, calculate the new value of x after replacing it with xy. 
  Then, recursively find the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of this new x equal to i-1 (since one operation has been performed). 
  Take the minimum among all these possibilities.

Hybrid approach: First, fill up the bottom-left corner to top-right diagonal of the dp array using a recursive function that uses memoization. Then, use the filled-up values as lookups for larger values of n.

Edge cases: Handle the edge case where x is 0 or 1 separately, since they have different properties than other values.
