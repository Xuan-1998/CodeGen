===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation: First, use recursion to find the minimum number of operations required for small values of n, then tabulate the results and use them as lookups for larger values of n.

base_case
Formulate state as a string representing the current decimal representation of x, and the transition relationship as:
  if the length of the current decimal representation is less than n,
    then try to append '0' or '1' to it and recursively calculate the minimum number of operations required;
  otherwise, return -1 since the length cannot be increased further.

Employ a 2D array where each sub-array represents a state (a string representing the current decimal representation of x) and its corresponding minimum number of operations required, updating the array in bottom-up manner.

Pre-compute all possible values of x up to the maximum value of 10^(n-1), by recursively calculating the minimum number of operations required for each value of x. This can be done using a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS).

Store the pre-computed results in a hash map or dictionary, where the key is the decimal representation of x and the value is the minimum number of operations required.

When asked to find the minimum number of operations for a given x, simply look up the result from the pre-computed table.

This approach ensures that the computation is done only once for each unique value of x, making it efficient and scalable.
