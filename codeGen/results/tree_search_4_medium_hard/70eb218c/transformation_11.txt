===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with memoization: The optimal substructure of this problem is that the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n can be achieved by considering the last digit of x and then recursively solving for the remaining digits. You can use memoization to avoid redundant computations.

The state is a tuple (x, n), where x is the current number and n is the target length.
You can define the state as (k, l) where k is the number of digits in the current decimal representation of x and l is the target length. The transition relationship can be formulated by considering the last digit of x and then recursively solving for the remaining digits.

Define a dynamic programming function with memoization using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems, and update the memoization table as you solve each problem. Initialize the memoization table with values (-1) for all initial states (k=0, l=n).

The base case is when k=l, return 0 if the length of decimal representation of x is already equal to n.

For other cases, consider the last digit of x:

* If the last digit is not 0, you can reduce the problem size by replacing x with 10*x % 10 and decrementing l.
* If the last digit is 0, you cannot make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n.

The transition relationship can be formulated as: dp(k+1, l) = min(dp(k+1-1, l-1)+1 if k>0, -1) if k==0
