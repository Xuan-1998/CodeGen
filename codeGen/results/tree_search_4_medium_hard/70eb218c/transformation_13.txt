===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a top-down recursive approach with memoization:

The optimal substructure of this problem is that the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n can be achieved by considering the last digit of x and then recursively solving for the remaining digits. You can use memoization to avoid redundant computations.

The state is simply n, as we only care about the target length.

Consider the last digit d of x and consider the options to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n:

* If the length of decimal representation of x is already less than or equal to n, return 0 because no operations are needed.
* If the length of decimal representation of x is greater than n, multiply x by 10 until the length becomes n, and recursively call the function with the updated value. This operation counts as one step.
* If d is 0, you can't make the length shorter; so return -1 because it's impossible to achieve the target length.

Memoization can be implemented by defining a recursive function with a dictionary memo where the key is the current state (n) and the value is the result, avoiding redundant computations.

The base case for recursion is when n equals 1. In this case, if x is not equal to 0, return 0 because one step is enough; otherwise, return -1 because it's impossible to achieve the target length.
