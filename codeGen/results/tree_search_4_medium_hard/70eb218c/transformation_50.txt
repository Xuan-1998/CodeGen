===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation:
First, use recursion to find the minimum number of operations required for small values of n, then tabulate the results and use them as lookups for larger values of n.

For x = 10^(i-1), the minimum number of operations is always i.

Think about defining a state as a pair (n, d) where d is the current digit of x and n is the remaining length. The transition would be from one state to another by either adding a new digit or removing the last digit.

Employ bottom-up tabulation: Create a 2D array dp with dimensions (n+1) * (10^k + 1), where k is the maximum number of digits in x, and initialize all values to infinity. Set dp(0, 0) to 0.
Iterate through n from 1 to N, and for each n:
  Iterate through x from 0 to 10^(n-1)-1, and for each x:
    If the length of decimal representation of x is equal to n, set dp(n, x) to 0. 
    Otherwise, consider adding a new digit or removing the last digit.
      Calculate the minimum number of operations required by adding a new digit: Calculate the number of digits in x * 10^k, where k is the maximum number of digits in x. If this value is less than n, set dp(n, x) to min(dp(n-1, x//10), dp(n-k, x//10)+k).
      Calculate the minimum number of operations required by removing the last digit: Calculate the number of digits in x//10. If this value is less than n, set dp(n, x) to min(dp(n-1, x//10), dp(n-1, x)+1).

Finally, return dp(N, x).
