===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursive memoization with bottom-up tabulation:
For x = 10^(i-1), the minimum number of operations is always i.

Consider using a recursive function that takes as input the current value of n and x, 
and returns the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n.

To implement memoization, define a dictionary memo that maps tuples of (n, x) to their corresponding minimum operation counts.
Use recursion to find the minimum number of operations for small values of n, then tabulate the results and use them as lookups for larger values of n.

Start by calculating the base case: if the length of decimal representation of x is already equal to n, return 0.
Otherwise, consider two possibilities:
- If x is less than or equal to 9, it can be made to have a length of n by appending digits, which requires n - 1 operations. 
- Otherwise, x must be in the form 10k for some k, so we need to find the minimum number of operations required to make k have a length of n - 1.
Recursively call the function with arguments (n - 1, k) and add 1 to the result.

Memoize the results of each recursive call by storing them in the dictionary memo.
When calculating the result for a given pair (n, x), check if it is already stored in the dictionary. 
If it is, return the stored value; otherwise, calculate the result recursively and store it in the dictionary before returning it.

Tabulate the results of the recursive function calls by storing them in a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of j equal to i.
Fill up the first row of dp with base cases, then fill up the rest of the array using the memoized results.

Finally, return the value stored at dp[n][x] as the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to n.
