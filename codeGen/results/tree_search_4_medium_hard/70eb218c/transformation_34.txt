===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a dynamic programming approach:
Let dp[i] be the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of x equal to i.
The state is dp[i], which can range from 1 to n.
dp[i] = dp[min(i-1, len(str(x)))-1)] + 1 if x // 10**(i-1) == 0 else 
            min(dp[j] + (i-j-1) + (x // 10**j != 0)) for i in range(2, n+1)
Generate the lookup table based on the recurrence relation, where the current minimum number of operations depends on the previous minimum number of operations.
Fill in dp[1] as base case: dp[1] = 0
