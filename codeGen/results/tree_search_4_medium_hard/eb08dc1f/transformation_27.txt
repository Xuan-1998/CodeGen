===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i][j] represent the number of blocks ending at position i with j digits.

dp[0][j] = 1 for all j (base case)

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(j, min(j+1, n)))

For each position i from 0 to n:
    For each number of digits j from 1 to min(j, n):
        Calculate dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(j, min(j+1, n)))
Return the sum of all dp[i][n] values.
