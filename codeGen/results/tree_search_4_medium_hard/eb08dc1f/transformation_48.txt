===BEGIN PLAN===
To use top-down approach with memoization, define a function that recursively counts blocks for smaller inputs.

The state expression is a pair (i, j) where i is the current digit and j is the number of consecutive equal digits found so far.

Create a 2D list dp where each entry stores the count of blocks for a given length and position.
dp[i][j] will store the count of blocks of length j up to index i in the given range from 0 to 10^n-1

Function will take three parameters: n, pos, and last_digit. It will return the total number of blocks for the given range.

Base case: if n is less than or equal to 0, then it means that we have counted all digits and there are no more blocks left. So, return 0.
If pos is greater than 10^n-1, then it means that we have gone beyond the given range. So, return 0.

Recursive case:
If last_digit == (pos % 10), then it means that the current digit is same as the last digit seen so far. In this case, count the number of blocks for the remaining n-1 digits and add to the result.
Else, reset the count and start counting new blocks.
Store the result in dp[i][j] and update i.
