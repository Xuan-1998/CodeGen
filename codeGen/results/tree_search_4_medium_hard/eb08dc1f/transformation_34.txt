===BEGIN PLAN===
To decide on optimal substructure, think about how blocks can be extended from left to right.

The base case would be that for any i, there is only one block ending at position i with 1 digit (which is just the digit itself).

Consider a state where you store the count of blocks that end at each position, considering all possible blocks of lengths 1 to n.
Use dynamic programming with a 2D table to store the count of blocks that end at each position for each length.

 Initialize the table dp[i][j] where i is the position and j is the length. 
Base case: dp[i][1] = 1 for all i, since there's only one block ending at position i with 1 digit.
For longer lengths, consider two cases:
- The last digit is the same as the previous one (dp[i-1][j-1]).
- The last digit is different from the previous one (dp[i-1][j] - count of blocks that end at position i-1 with length j).
Update dp[i][j] accordingly.
