===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming, define a function that recursively counts blocks for smaller inputs.

The state expression is a pair (i, j) where i is the current digit and j is the number of consecutive equal digits found so far. This allows us to keep track of the current sequence of equal digits and its length.

The transition function should increment pos for each digit, and update l if a new sequence of equal digits starts.

Define a memoization function that takes an integer n and returns a list of integers representing the number of blocks of each length from 1 to n.

In this function, use a dictionary dp to store the results of subproblems. For each i from 0 to n-1, calculate the total count of blocks ending at i and update the result in dp.

Finally, return the list of counts in dp.
