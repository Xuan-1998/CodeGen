===BEGIN PLAN===
To decide on optimal substructure, think about how blocks can be extended from left to right.

Let dp[i][j] represent the number of blocks ending at position i with j digits.
dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(j, min(j+1, n)))

This plan seems correct. It uses dynamic programming to solve the problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and storing the results in a 2D array dp.

To improve this plan, we can sort the blocks by their length from shortest to longest and then calculate the number of blocks of each length from left to right. This will reduce the time complexity of the plan.

The potential issue with this plan is that it does not handle edge cases properly. For example, what if n = 1? We need to add a check for this case at the beginning of the plan and handle it separately.

Here is the updated version of the entire detailed plan:
