===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, consider counting the number of blocks ending at each digit position.

Choose a state for each digit position, i.e., the number of blocks that end at that position with length 1 to n.

The state for each digit position is the number of blocks that end at that position with length 1 to n. Let's denote this state as dp[i]. We can calculate dp[i] by considering all possible lengths from 1 to n, and update it based on the previous states (dp[j]) where j < i.

The key insight here is that a block ending at position i of length k can be extended or not, depending on whether the digit at position i-k+1 is the same as the one at position i. If they are the same, we can extend the block to have length k+1; otherwise, we cannot.

Implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by iterating from n to 1 and updating the state dp[i] based on the previous states (dp[j]) where j < i. The recurrence relation for dp[i] is as follows:

- If the digit at position i is the same as the one at position i-n, then we can extend all blocks ending at position i of length from 1 to n-1, so dp[i] += dp[i-n]
- Otherwise, we only consider blocks of length 1 because they cannot be extended
dp[i] = (the number of blocks ending at position i of length 1)

The final answer is the sum of all states dp[i] for i ranging from 1 to n.
