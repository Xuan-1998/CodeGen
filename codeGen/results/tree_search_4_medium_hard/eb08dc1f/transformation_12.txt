===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, consider counting the number of blocks ending at each digit position.

Let dp[i][k] be the count of blocks ending at digit position i with length k.

The state is the count of blocks ending at each digit position up to length k.
The state represents the number of blocks of length 1 to k that end at each digit position.

Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you iterate over the range [0, 10^n - 1] and update the count for blocks of each length as you go. 

For each number from 0 to 10^n - 1:
    For each block ending at this position:
        If the block is of length k:
            Update dp[i][k]
        For each possible block extension (by appending a digit):
            If the extended block ends at this position and has length k+1:
                Update dp[i][k+1]

Let's calculate the number of blocks for each length. To do so, sum up all occurrences of blocks ending at each digit position with that length.

For each length from 1 to n:
    Calculate total_blocks[k] = Î£(dp[i][k]) (i in range [0, 10^n - 1])

Return total_blocks[1], total_blocks[2], ..., total_blocks[n]

The answer is the vector of counts modulo 998244353
