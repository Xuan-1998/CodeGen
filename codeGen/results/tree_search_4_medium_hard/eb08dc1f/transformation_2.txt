===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, consider counting the number of blocks ending at each digit position.

Choose a state for each digit position, i.e., the number of blocks that end at that position with length 1 to n. This can be represented by an array dp[] where dp[i] is the count of blocks ending at the ith position and having lengths from 1 to n.

Consider the count of blocks ending at each digit position, as well as the block structure information at this position. To calculate dp[], iterate over all numbers from 0 to 10^n - 1 and for each number, find the last digit that is different from the previous one. This will be the end of a block.

Utilize a 2D array dp[][] where dp[i][j] represents the count of blocks ending at position i with length j. Initialize dp[0][i] to 1 because there's always exactly one block of length 1, and then update dp[i][j] as follows:

* If the last digit is different from the previous one, it means we've encountered a new block; increment the count for this block.
* Else, the current number has the same digits as the previous one. Calculate how many blocks with this length can be formed in total and update dp[i][j] accordingly.

Finally, calculate the final answer by summing up dp[n-1][i] * 10^(n-i-1) for all i from 0 to n. This represents the count of blocks of each length.
