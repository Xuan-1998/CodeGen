===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, consider counting the number of blocks ending at each digit position.
The state is the count of blocks with exactly k consecutive equal digits in them.
Let the state be a tuple (k, c) representing the number of blocks ending at each digit position with exactly k consecutive equal digits in them, and c being the current count.

For each digit 0 to 9:
    Initialize an array dp[i] for i from 1 to n, filled with zeros.
    For each block length j from 1 to n:
        dp[j][i] = (dp[j-1][i] + dp[j-1][i-1]) mod 998244353

Return the last row of the array.
