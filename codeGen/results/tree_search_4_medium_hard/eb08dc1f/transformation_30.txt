===BEGIN PLAN===
To decide on optimal substructure, think about how blocks can be extended from left to right.

Let dp[i][j] represent the number of blocks ending at position i with j digits.

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-k-1][min(k, j)] for k in range(0, i+1)) + 1 if all digits from i-k to i are equal

Memoize the subproblems using a dictionary and iterate over all possible lengths of blocks, considering edge cases where n is less than or equal to 1.

Let's use dp[i][j] = 0 for all i < 0 (base case) and dp[0][j] = 1 if j is 0

For each position i and block length j, we can iterate over all possible values of k from 0 to i. For each value of k, we update the count of blocks ending at position i with j digits.

This plan takes care of edge cases where n is less than or equal to 1.
