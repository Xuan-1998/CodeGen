===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming with memoization, we will define a function that recursively counts blocks for smaller inputs. The state expression is a tuple (i, j) where i is the current digit and j is the number of consecutive equal digits found so far.

The state will be represented as (l, k, pos): l is the length of the block, k is the count of blocks with this length, and pos is the current position in the number.

We will define a function dp(l, k) that takes the state as input, performs some computation, and returns the result. This function will be used to fill up our memoization table.

The base case for our recursion will be when the length of the block (l) is 0, meaning we have found all the blocks of a certain length.

In each recursive step, we will iterate over all possible next digits that can be added to the current block. For each digit, we will recursively call dp(l+1, k+1) and add it to our count if the new block is valid (i.e., the same as the previous one).

The function will return k + 1, which represents the total count of blocks with length l.

Finally, we will fill up our memoization table by calling dp(0, 0) for each number from 0 to 10^n - 1 and then summing up all the counts modulo 998244353.
