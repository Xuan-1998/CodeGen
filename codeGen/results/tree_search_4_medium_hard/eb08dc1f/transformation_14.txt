===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, consider counting the number of blocks ending at each digit position.

dp[i][k] represents the count of blocks ending at digit position i and having length k.

The state is initialized as follows:
- dp[0][1] = 10^(n-1) // for a block of length 1
- dp[0][k] = 0 for k > 1

Transition function:
dp[i][k] = sum(dp[j][l] * (10^(i-j)-1) for j in range(i), l in range(1, min(k+1, i-j+2)))

Base case: 
dp[n][1] is the count of blocks ending at digit position n and having length 1

The final answer is the sum of dp[i][k] for k from 1 to n.
