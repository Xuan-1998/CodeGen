===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with memoization in a bottom-up approach.

Let's define the state as (l, k): l is the length of the block and k is the count of blocks with this length. The function dp(i, j) will return the total number of blocks up to position i with the last j digits being equal.

We can initialize a dictionary dp where keys are states and values are results. Then we iterate over all positions in the number from right to left and update the dp dictionary accordingly.

Base cases: When i is less than 0, it means we have reached the beginning of the number, so return 1. If j is less than 0 or l is less than 0, it's not a valid state, so return 0.

Transition rule: For each position i and last j digits being equal:

- If this is the first digit, dp(i, j) = 1
- If there are already k blocks of length l found before, add k to dp(i - 1, j)
- Add a new block of length l to the count

Finally, return dp(n - 1, n)
