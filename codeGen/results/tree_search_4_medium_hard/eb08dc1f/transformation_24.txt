===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, consider counting the number of blocks ending at each digit position.

The state is the count of blocks with exactly k consecutive equal digits in them.

Let the state be a tuple (k, c) representing the number of blocks ending at each digit position with exactly k consecutive equal digits in them, and c being the current count.

Maintain a dynamic programming table dp[k] where dp[k] represents the total count of blocks ending at each digit position with exactly k consecutive equal digits in them.

For each digit position i from 0 to n-1:

    Initialize a variable curr_count = 0.
    For each block length l from 1 to min(n, 10^(i+1)):
        If the block has exactly l consecutive equal digits:
            Update curr_count by adding dp[l-1] * (10^((i+1)-l) - 10^((i+1)-l-1)).
        Else:
            Break the loop.
    Update dp[i] = curr_count.
