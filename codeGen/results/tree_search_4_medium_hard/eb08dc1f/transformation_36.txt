===BEGIN PLAN===
To decide on optimal substructure, think about how blocks can be extended from left to right.

The base case would be that for any i, there is only one block ending at position i with 1 digit (which is just the digit itself).

Consider a state where you store the count of blocks that end at each position, considering all possible blocks of lengths 1 to n.

Use memoization with a recursive function to store the results of subproblems.

Let dp[i][k] be the number of blocks ending at position i with k digits. Then,

dp[i][1] = 1 (base case)

for any j < i, if the digit at position j is equal to the digit at position i-k+1, then dp[i][k] += dp[j][k-1]

This plan considers all possible blocks of lengths 1 to n and uses memoization with a recursive function to store the results of subproblems.
