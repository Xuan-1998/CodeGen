===BEGIN PLAN===
To decide on optimal substructure, think about how blocks can be extended from left to right.

The base case would be that for any i, there is only one block ending at position i with 1 digit (which is just the digit itself).

Consider a state where you store the count of blocks that end at each position, considering all possible blocks of lengths 1 to n.
Let dp[i] denote the number of blocks that end at position i.

We can use dynamic programming with a 1D array to store the cumulative count of blocks that end at each position, considering all possible lengths. The recurrence relation would be:
dp[i] = (sum from j=0 to i-1) (number of ways to form a block of length i-j starting from position j)

At each step, we iterate over all positions up to i and for each position j, calculate the number of blocks that end at position i using the base case.

To calculate this, we can use the idea that a block of length k ending at position i can be extended as long as the digit at position i-k is the same as the last digit of the block. This would mean we need to consider all blocks of lengths 1 to k that end at position j and have the same last digit.

The final answer would be dp[n], which gives us the total number of blocks for each length from 1 to n.
