===BEGIN PLAN===
To use top-down approach with memoization, define a function that recursively counts blocks for smaller inputs.

Let dp[i][j] be the count of blocks of length j ending at digit i.
The state expression is a pair (i, j) where i is the current digit and j is the number of consecutive equal digits found so far.

A memoization table could store counts of blocks for given lengths (up to n) and positions from 0 to 10^n-1

Implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary to store the intermediate results. The base case would be when j = 1, in which case we simply count the number of blocks ending at digit i.

The recursive case would be where we count the number of blocks ending at digit i and having length j.
This is done by considering the previous digit (i-1) and the current digit (i).
For each possible value of the previous digit, we check if it's equal to the current digit.
If they're equal, then we add 1 to the count of blocks of that length found at the previous position.

The function should return dp[i][j] for the given input i and j.

The updated plan would be:
