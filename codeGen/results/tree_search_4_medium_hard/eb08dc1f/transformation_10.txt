===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, consider counting the number of blocks ending at each digit position.

Let dp[i][j] be the count of blocks ending at each digit position up to length i and containing j 0's. Initialize all dp[i][j]'s to 0 for all i and j.

The base case is when i = 1, where there can only be one block with length 1, which contains 1 or 9 (10^i - 1) 0's.

For each length i > 1, consider the number of blocks ending at each digit position that are not fully utilized. This can be calculated by summing up all dp[i-1][j]'s for j ranging from 0 to 9 minus the number of blocks of length i - 1 that are not fully utilized.

Store these counts in a prefix sum array, so that we only need to calculate the counts once and reuse them when calculating the counts for larger lengths.

Finally, return the count of blocks ending at each digit position up to length n.
