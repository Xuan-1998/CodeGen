===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, consider counting the number of blocks ending at each digit position.
Let dp[k][i] be the count of blocks ending at digit position i and having length k.
The state represents the count of blocks ending at each digit position up to length k.
Using an array to store the count of blocks ending at each digit position, then calculate the number of blocks of each length.

For a given block, it must have its rightmost digit as the last digit of a multiple of 10^(k-1) (since blocks cannot be extended to the left).
Count all integers from 0 to 10^n - 1 and for each integer:
    - For k from 1 to n:
        - Count the number of times the last k digits are a multiple of 10^(k-1)
        - Update dp[k][i] accordingly, where i is the digit at position k
    - Return the count of blocks of each length modulo 998244353

The plan does not include edge cases but it should work for all valid inputs.
