===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, consider counting the number of blocks ending at each digit position.

State: dp[i][j] represents the count of blocks ending at i-th digit position up to length j.
The state represents the count of blocks ending at each digit position up to length k.

Counting the number of blocks ending at each digit position for all lengths:
    - Initialize dp[0][0] = 1
    - For every i from 1 to n, for every j from 1 to n:
        - Calculate dp[i][j] as the sum of dp[k][j-1] * (10^(i-k)-1) for k from 0 to i-1 (inclusive)
    - Return dp[n][n]

This plan correctly captures the essence of the problem. It identifies the dynamic programming state and correctly counts the number of blocks ending at each digit position up to length j.
No potential issues or edge cases are mentioned, so this plan is mostly correct.

However, there's room for improvement:
    - Consider handling the modulo operation (998244353) during the computation instead of doing it afterwards. This could avoid unnecessary calculations and make the code more efficient.

Here is the updated plan:
