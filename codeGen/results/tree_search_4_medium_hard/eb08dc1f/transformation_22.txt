===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, consider counting the number of blocks ending at each digit position.

The state is the count of blocks with exactly k consecutive equal digits in them. Consider the state as (i, k) where i is the current digit and k is the length of the block.

Let dp[i][k] be the count of blocks ending at position i that have a length of k.
Let pre be the previous digit in the sequence (or -1 if it's the first digit).
For each digit i from 0 to 10^n-1, do:
    For each length k from 1 to n:
        If i % 10^k == pre % 10^k, then dp[i][k] = dp[pre][k-1]
        Else dp[i][k] = 0
    pre = i

Use a hashmap to store the frequency of each digit and then use this information to update the state.

Finally, iterate over all positions from 0 to 10^n-1, and for each position, add up the counts of blocks ending at that position with lengths from 1 to n. This sum is the answer.
