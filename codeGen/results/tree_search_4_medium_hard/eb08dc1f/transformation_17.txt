===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, consider counting the number of blocks ending at each digit position.

Let dp[i][k] be the count of blocks ending at position i and having length k.

1. Initialize dp[0][0] to 1 (since there is exactly one way to have a block of length 0 ending at position 0).
2. For each digit position i from 1 to n, iterate over each possible value for the digit at this position.
3. For each value v, consider all blocks ending at position i-1 that end with v and have length k (where 1 <= k <= n). The number of such blocks is dp[i-1][k-1] * (since there are dp[i-1][k-1] ways to have a block ending at position i-1 with the same value as the current digit).
4. Add up all these counts for each possible value v and store this total in dp[i][k].
5. Return dp[n][n] as the final answer.

The edge case is when n=0, which should return 1 because there is only one way to have no blocks (i.e., an empty string).

This plan seems correct and avoids redundant calculations by using memoization.
