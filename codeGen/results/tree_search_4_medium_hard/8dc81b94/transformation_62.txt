===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i] = True if and only if all elements in array[0..i] are equal to zero after applying some operations.

Define the base case as dp[n] = False, where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because it's not possible to make all elements in an array equal to zero by decrementing a certain number of elements at a time from either the beginning or end of the array if there are no more operations left.

To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can use a bottom-up approach. Initialize dp[0] = True and dp[n] = False for all n > 0.

Now, consider an element a[i]. To make all elements equal to zero after i operations, either the first or last element needs to be decremented by i at each operation. We know that we have done at most i operations. So, we can decrement the first or last element of the array up to i times.

This gives us the following recurrence relation: dp[i] = (a[i-1] == 0 and dp[i-1]) or (a[n-i] == 0 and dp[i-1])

This recurrence relation can be used to build a dynamic programming solution. The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we need to process each element in the array once, and the space complexity is also O(n) for storing the dynamic programming values.
