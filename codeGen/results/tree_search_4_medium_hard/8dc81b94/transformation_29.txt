===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's an optimal substructure for this problem, where making one part of the array equal to zero is sufficient to solve the entire problem, allowing you to apply dynamic programming using tabulation.

Let dp[i][k] represent whether it's possible to make all elements in the first i elements of the array equal to k.

dp[i][0] = true (base case: making all elements equal to 0 is always possible)

dp[i][k] = (k == 0) || (k > 0 && dp[i-1][k-1] && a_i >= k) || (k < 0 && dp[i-1][k+1] && a_i <= -k);

Create a 2D table dp where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements in the first i elements of the array equal to j.
