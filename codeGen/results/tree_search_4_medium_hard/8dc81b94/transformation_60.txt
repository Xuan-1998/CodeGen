===BEGIN PLAN===
Define dp[i] as a boolean indicating whether it's possible to make all elements in the first i elements of the array equal to zero by applying some operations. 
The base case is dp[0] = True because there are no more operations needed to make an empty array equal to zero.
The recursive relation can be defined as follows:
- If the difference between the current element and the last element processed (the 'end' pointer) is decreasing, then it's possible to make all elements in the first i elements of the array equal to zero if it's possible to do so for the remaining elements (i.e., dp[i - 1]).
- If the difference between the current element and the first element processed (the 'start' pointer) is increasing, then it's possible to make all elements in the first i elements of the array equal to zero by moving the start pointer forward (i.e., dp[i - 1]) or keeping it at its current position.
The recurrence relation can be written as: 
dp[i] = min(dp[j - 1], j) for 0 <= j < i.

To make sure that all elements in the array become equal to zero, we need to check if dp[n - 1] is True. If it is, then it's possible to make all elements in the array equal to zero; otherwise, it's not.
