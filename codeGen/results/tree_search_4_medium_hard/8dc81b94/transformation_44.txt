===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's an optimal substructure for this problem, where making one part of the array equal to zero is sufficient to solve the entire problem, allowing you to apply dynamic programming using tabulation.

Define dp[i][k] as true if and only if for every j <= k, it is possible to make all elements in the first i-1 elements of the array equal to j.

dp[i][k] should be true if and only if the maximum value in the first i-1 elements is less than or equal to k, and there exists j <= k such that it is possible to make all elements in the first i-1 elements equal to j.

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][k] represents whether it's possible to make all elements in the first i-1 elements of the array equal to k.

For each cell dp[i][k], check if it's possible to make all elements in the first i-1 elements equal to k. If yes, then return "YES". Otherwise, continue to the next cell.

Check for edge cases: The input array contains only positive integers and its size does not exceed 30000.
