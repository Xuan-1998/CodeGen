===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a top-down dynamic programming approach, where you recursively explore all possible ways to make the array elements equal to zero, and store the results in a memoized dictionary.

Define the state as the current sum of elements in the array, considering all possible operations that can be applied to make the array equal to zero.
State: Whether the current sum is zero or not, Transition: Apply an operation that would make the sum zero, otherwise do nothing.

Create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to make all elements in the array equal to zero considering only the first i elements and having a remaining sum of j.
Base case: If the remaining sum is less than or equal to 0, then it's always possible to make the array equal to zero.

Transition:
- For each operation (decrement from start or end), update dp[i][j] if the new remaining sum is still non-negative and not previously calculated.
- Update dp[i][j] with the maximum of its current value and the values obtained by applying the operations.

Return "YES" if dp[n][0], otherwise return "NO".
