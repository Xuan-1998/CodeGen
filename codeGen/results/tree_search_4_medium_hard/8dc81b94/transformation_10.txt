===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you iteratively build up solutions for smaller subarrays and combine them to solve the original problem.

Define the state as the maximum number of operations required to make the array elements equal to zero, considering all possible operations that can be applied to make the array equal to zero.

State: The maximum number of operations required to make the array elements equal to zero, Transition: Apply an operation that reduces the total sum by a constant or increases it by a constant.

Initialize the dynamic programming table with base cases:

* For an empty array (n = 0), the maximum number of operations is 0.
* For an array with one element (n = 1), the maximum number of operations is 1 if the element is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.

Fill in the dynamic programming table by considering all possible subarrays:

* For each subarray [a1...an], calculate the maximum number of operations required to make its elements equal to zero.
* For a single-element array (n = 1), the maximum number of operations is 1 if the element is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.
* For an empty array (n = 0), the maximum number of operations is 0.

Combine the dynamic programming table with the original problem:

* The maximum number of operations required to make all elements in the array equal to zero is the minimum value in the dynamic programming table.

Check for edge cases: What if the input array contains only zeros? In this case, you can return "YES" immediately.
