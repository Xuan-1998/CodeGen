===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 1D DP table where dp[i] represents whether it's possible to make all elements in the first i positions of the array equal to zero if we can decrement up to i elements from the end. The base case is dp[0] = True, since an empty array has no elements to decrement.
The recursive relationship can be expressed as:
dp[i] = (dp[i-1] and a_i >= 1) or dp[i-1]
This means that either we can decrement the current element and continue processing the rest of the array, or we cannot decrement the current element because it's already zero, so we just process the rest of the array as before.
To make the DP computation more efficient, we can use a bottom-up approach by iterating from i = n to 1. For each i, we compute dp[i] based on dp[i-1] and the value of a_i.
The final answer is dp[n]. If it's True, then it's possible to make all elements in the array equal to zero; otherwise, it's not possible.
