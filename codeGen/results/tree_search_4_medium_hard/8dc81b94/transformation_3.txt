===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you start with the base case of an empty array (which is trivially YES), and then iteratively build up the solution by considering smaller subarrays.

Define the state as a pair of integers (left, right) representing the sum of elements from index left to the end of the array, and the sum of elements from the start of the array to index right. This allows you to easily determine if it's possible to make all elements equal to zero by decrementing certain elements.

Initialize a memoized dictionary dp with default value False, where dp[(left, right)] represents whether it's possible to make all elements in the subarray [left..right] equal to zero.

Base case: For an empty array (i.e., left = right), set dp[(-1, -1)] = True, since it's always possible to make an empty array equal to zero by doing nothing.

Iterate over all indices i from 0 to n-1, and for each i:
    Calculate the sum of elements in the subarray [i+1..n] (right), and calculate the sum of elements in the subarray [0..i] (left).
    If dp[(left, right)] is True, then it's possible to make all elements in this subarray equal to zero. Otherwise, set dp[(left, right)] = False.
Return dp[(0, n-1)], which represents whether it's possible to make all elements in the original array equal to zero.
