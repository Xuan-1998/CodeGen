dp[i] = True if it's possible to make all elements in a[i..n-1] equal to zero, and False otherwise.

Let dp[i][j] be the state expression for whether it is possible to make all elements in array slice a[i..j] equal to zero. Then consider implementing memoization recursively by passing the current start index i, end index j as arguments, storing the results in a dictionary for later reference:

dp[i][j] = True if any of the following conditions hold:
    - The difference between j and i is 1, meaning there's only one element left. In this case, we just need to check if that element is zero.
    - It is possible to make all elements in array slice a[i+1..j-1] equal to zero (dp[i+1][j-1]), and the last element in a[i..j] can be reduced to zero by removing either the first or last element from this subarray. This means that if j-i is even, we need to make sure the middle element is zero; otherwise, the end element needs to be zero.

Consider implementing memoization recursively as follows:

dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] and (a[j]%2 == 0 or a[i]%2 == 0) if j-i > 1
    elif j - i == 1
        return a[0] == 0
    else
        return False

Initialize dp with zeros and fill in the values for all possible subarrays from left to right. The final answer is whether it's possible to make all elements in array a equal to zero, which is the value of dp[0][n-1].
