===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's an optimal substructure for this problem, where making one part of the array equal to zero is sufficient to solve the entire problem, allowing you to apply dynamic programming using tabulation.

Consider dp[i][j] as a state, where we have made all elements from index 0 to i-1 equal to zero and j represents whether the current element (at index i) has been decremented or not. We need to find if it's possible to make all elements in the first i+1 elements of the array equal to 0.

Initialize the base case as dp[0][0] = (a[0] == 0), indicating whether the first element is already equal to zero.

Consider a state where we have made all elements from index 0 to i-1 equal to zero. We can either make the current element (at index i) equal to zero by decrementing it, or leave it as it is and consider the remaining elements. This leads to two possible states: dp[i][0] and dp[i][1]. The state dp[i][0] represents that we have decremented the current element, and the state dp[i][1] represents that we haven't.

The transition from dp[i-1][j] to dp[i][k] (where k can be either 0 or 1) depends on whether the current element is decremented or not. If the current element is decremented, then it's possible to make all elements in the first i+1 elements equal to zero only if a[i] = 0; otherwise, we need to check if the remaining elements can be made zero.

If the current element isn't decremented, then it's possible to make all elements in the first i+1 elements equal to zero only if the remaining elements can be made zero and a[i] is not zero.

The final answer will be dp[n-1][0], indicating whether it's possible to make all elements in the array equal to zero or not.
