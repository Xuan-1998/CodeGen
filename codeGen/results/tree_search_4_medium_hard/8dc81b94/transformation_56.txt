===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i] = True if it's possible to make all elements in a[0..i-1] equal to zero, and False otherwise.

Use a recursive function with memoization: dp[i] = (dp[i-1] and canMakeZero(a[i..n-1])) or (canMakeZero(a[0..i-1]) and dp[n-i]), where canMakeZero(subarray) is a helper function that checks if the sum of all elements in subarray equals the length of the subarray.

Let the state expression be dp[i] = True if it's possible to make all elements in a[i..n-1] equal to zero, and False otherwise.

Look into whether there's a recursive relationship between smaller problems and larger ones, which could be solved by memoizing the results.
