===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you iteratively update the array elements in-place by either decrementing or skipping them, and check if all elements become equal to zero.
Define the state as the current sum of the array elements from index i to j, and define the transition relationship based on whether the sum is greater than 0, equal to 0, or less than 0. If the sum is positive, decrement it by 1; if negative, increment it by 1; if zero, leave it as is.
To decide which operation (decrementing or skipping) to perform at each step, you can maintain two pointers, one from the start of the array and one from the end. If the sum is positive, move the pointer from the start towards the end; if negative, move the pointer from the end towards the start. If the sum is zero, both pointers stay in place.
Keep track of whether it's possible to make all elements equal to zero starting from indices i and j by maintaining a flag that becomes 'YES' only when all elements are 0 at the same time.
