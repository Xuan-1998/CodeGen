===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a top-down dynamic programming approach, where you recursively explore all possible ways to make the array elements equal to zero, and store the results in a memoized dictionary.

Define the state as a boolean indicating whether it's possible to make the array equal to zero by applying operations, with base cases being arrays that are already equal to zero or have only one element. You can also consider defining states based on the current sum of the array elements, and formulate state transitions based on how these values change as you process each element.

The recursive function would take the current sum of the array elements as input, and return whether it's possible to make the array equal to zero by applying operations. The base case for this recursion would be when the array is already equal to zero or has only one element, in which case it's always possible to make the array equal to zero.

To improve this plan, you can consider adding more states and state transitions to handle edge cases. For example, you might need to handle the case where all elements are greater than zero but the sum is less than zero (which means that some negative values can be added to make it equal to zero).

Here's an updated version of the plan:
