===BEGIN PLAN===
Look into whether there's a recursive relationship between smaller problems and larger ones, which could be solved by memoizing the results.

Define dp[i] as True if it's possible to make all elements in the array from index 0 to i equal to zero. The base case is dp[0] = True because there are no more operations needed to make an empty array equal to zero.

Think about how to use the 'greedy' approach, by always choosing the operation that will make the largest impact on the remaining elements in the array. For each element at index i, consider two options:

- Decrement it and see if the rest of the array can be made zero.
- Leave it as is and decrement the last element.

Memoization can be used to store the intermediate results of the recursive function calls, which could lead to an exponential time complexity if not properly optimized. The key idea is to identify the overlapping subproblems that can be solved using a dynamic programming approach.

To optimize the memoization, use a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to make all elements in the array from index 0 to i equal to zero if the last j elements are decremented. The base case is dp[0][j] = True for any j.

Then, iterate through the array and update dp[i][j] based on the two options above. If either option makes it possible to make all elements in the array from index 0 to i equal to zero if the last j elements are decremented, then dp[i][j] should be set to True.

Finally, return dp[n-1][n-1], which represents whether it's possible to make all elements in the entire array equal to zero.
