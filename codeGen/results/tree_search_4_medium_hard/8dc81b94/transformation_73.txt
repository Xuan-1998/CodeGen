===BEGIN PLAN===
Look into whether there's a recursive relationship between smaller problems and larger ones, which could be solved by memoizing the results.
Consider the state expression dp[n] = (dp[n-1] or any(a[0] > 0)) as we can either process the entire array and decrement elements from the beginning if there are non-zero elements at the start or continue processing the array.
Formulate state dp[n] = min(dp[n-1], any(a[i] > 0) ? (dp[0] or all(a[j] == 0 for j in range(n-1))) : dp[n-1]) as we can either process the entire array and decrement elements from the beginning if there are non-zero elements at the start or continue processing the array.
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing dp with zeros and filling it up iteratively, where dp[0] = (all(a[i] == 0) ? "YES" : "NO") and for n > 1, dp[n] = min(dp[n-1], any(a[i] > 0) ? (dp[0] or all(a[j] == 0 for j in range(n-1))) : dp[n-1]).
Check if the last element is zero, then it's possible to make all elements equal to zero.
If the array contains only one element and that element is not zero, then we can't make all elements equal to zero.
