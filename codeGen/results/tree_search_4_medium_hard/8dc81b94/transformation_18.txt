===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you iteratively build up the solution by processing each array element from left to right (or right to left) and keeping track of the maximum number of operations required to make all elements equal to zero.

Define the state as an integer indicating the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the subarray equal to zero, with base cases being arrays that are already equal to zero or have only one element.

The recursive function should take two parameters: the current index and the target value (0). The function will recursively call itself until it reaches the end of the array or finds a solution.

To improve the plan, consider using memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. This can be done by storing the results in a dictionary where the key is the current index and the value is the minimum number of operations required to make all elements equal to zero.

Edge cases should include arrays that are already equal to zero or have only one element, as these will require no operations.
