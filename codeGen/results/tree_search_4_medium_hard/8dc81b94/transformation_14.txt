===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you build up the results by considering all possible ways to make the array elements equal to zero.

Define the state as the current sum of elements in the array, and whether it's possible to make the remaining elements equal to zero. The transition is based on two operations: subtracting the first element or adding the last element.

Create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to make all elements in the array equal to zero considering the first i elements and having a sum of j.

The base case for the problem is when the sum is already zero, so you can return YES immediately. If the sum is non-zero, you need to consider two possibilities: subtracting the first element or adding the last element. This gives you two recursive cases:

* If you subtract the first element and the remaining elements are equal to zero, then the answer is YES.
* If you add the last element and the remaining elements are equal to zero, then the answer is also YES.

The final answer will be the maximum of these two possibilities. If neither possibility works, then the answer is NO.
