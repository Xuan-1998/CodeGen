===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you iteratively build up solutions for sub-problems and store the results in a memoized dictionary.

Define the state as a boolean indicating whether it's possible to make the array equal to zero by applying operations, with base cases being arrays that are already equal to zero or have only one element.

Formulate the problem recursively:

- If the array is empty, return true (since there are no operations needed).
- If the array has only one element, check if it's equal to 0. If yes, return true; otherwise, return false.
- For arrays with more than one element:
  - Try subtracting the last element from the first element. If the resulting array is possible to make zero (based on memoized results), return true.
  - Try removing the last element. If the resulting array is possible to make zero (based on memoized results), return true.
- Store the result of the recursive call in a memoized dictionary for later use.

Use a recursive function with memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
