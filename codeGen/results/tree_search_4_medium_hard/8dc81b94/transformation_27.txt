===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's an optimal substructure for this problem, where making one part of the array equal to zero is sufficient to solve the entire problem, allowing you to apply dynamic programming using tabulation.

Let dp[i][k] represent whether it's possible to make all elements in the first i elements of the array equal to k. Since we need to decrement a certain number of elements at a time from either the beginning or end of the array, we can consider the remainder of each element modulo 2. If the remainder is 0, we can simply decrement it to get to zero; if the remainder is 1, we need to decrement two elements to get to zero.

dp[i][k] = (dp[i-1][k-(a_i-1)%2] && a_i > 0) || dp[i-1][k+(a_i-1)%2];

To implement memoization using a dictionary where the keys are tuples of (i, k) and the values are boolean values indicating whether it's possible to make all elements in the first i elements of the array equal to k.
