===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a top-down dynamic programming approach, where you recursively explore all possible ways to make the array elements equal to zero, and store the results in a memoized dictionary.

Define the state as a tuple (i, j) representing the current indices into the array, where i is the index from the start of the array and j is the index from the end of the array.

The transition relationship can be formulated as follows: if the current element at index i or j is greater than 0, then we have two choices - either decrement it (and move to the next element), or skip it (and move to the previous element). If the current element is already 0, then we simply move to the next element. We can represent this as a function f(i, j) that returns 'YES' if it's possible to make all elements equal to zero starting from indices i and j, and 'NO' otherwise.

Memoize the results of the recursive function calls by storing them in a dictionary, but instead of using a separate dictionary for each recursive call, use a single dictionary where keys are tuples (i, j) and values are either 'YES' or 'NO'.

To avoid unnecessary recursive calls, sort the array first and then start from both ends. If an element at index i is greater than 0, we can move to the next element only if all elements after index i have been processed. Similarly, if an element at index j is greater than 0, we can move to the previous element only if all elements before index j have been processed.

Check for edge cases: what if the array contains only zeros? In this case, the answer should be 'YES'.
