===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i] be True if it's possible to make all elements in a[0..n-i-1] equal to zero, and False otherwise.
We can update this state based on whether or not it is possible to make all elements in the subarray a[n-i..n-1] equal to zero.

Let's define a recursive function without memoization:

dp[i] = (dp[i-1] && (sum(a[0..i]) == i)) || (!dp[i-1] && sum(a[n-i..n-1]) == 0)

This is because if we can make all elements in the subarray a[0..n-i-1] equal to zero, then it's possible to make all elements in the array a[0..n-1] equal to zero by setting the remaining i elements to i. If we cannot make all elements in the subarray a[0..n-i-1] equal to zero but can set all elements in the subarray a[n-i..n-1] to 0, then it's also possible to make all elements in the array a[0..n-1] equal to zero.

To avoid redundant computation, we can use memoization by storing the results of dp[i] for each i in an array.

The base case is when i = n, in which case dp[n] = True if and only if sum(a) = 0.

Let's initialize a boolean array with size n+1, where dp[0] = True since it's possible to make all elements in the empty array equal to zero.

We can then fill up this array by computing each dp[i] based on its recursive definition.

Finally, we return dp[n].
