===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you start with the base case of an empty array (which is trivially YES), and then iteratively build up the solution by considering smaller subarrays.

Define a dynamic programming table dp where dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to make all elements in the subarray from index i to j equal to zero.

Initialize dp with all values set to 0, and consider the base case: if n is 0, return YES (since an empty array can be made equal to zero).

Then, for each subarray [i, j], where 0 <= i <= j < n:

1. If i == j, check if a[i] is greater than 0; if so, update dp[i][j] as NO.
2. Otherwise, consider two cases:
	* Case 1: decrement from the beginning (i.e., subtract a[i] from every element in [i, j]).
	* Case 2: decrement from the end (i.e., subtract a[j] from every element in [i, j]).

For each case:

	+ Calculate the new values for dp[i][j-1] and dp[i+1][j].
	+ If either of these values is YES, update dp[i][j] as YES; otherwise, set it to NO.
3. Return the value of dp[0][n-1].
