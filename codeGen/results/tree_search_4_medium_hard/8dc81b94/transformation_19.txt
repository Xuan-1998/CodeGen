===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you iteratively build up the solution by processing each array element from left to right and keeping track of the maximum number of operations required to make all elements equal to zero.

Define a function that takes an array as input, iterates through it, and for each element, calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all subsequent elements equal to zero by applying operations from either end of the array. Store this result in a memoized dictionary.

The base case is when the array has only one element; in this case, you can simply decrement the element once to make it equal to zero.

For larger arrays, consider the following recursive relation:

- If the current element is greater than 1, you have two options: either decrement the current element or decrement an element from the right side of the array. In both cases, you need to recursively calculate the minimum number of operations required to make all subsequent elements equal to zero.
- If the current element is 0 or 1, you can't apply any operations; just move on to the next element.

Finally, return "YES" if it's possible to make all elements equal to zero by applying a certain number of operations and "NO" otherwise.
