===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's an optimal substructure for this problem, where making one part of the array equal to zero is sufficient to solve the entire problem, allowing you to apply dynamic programming using tabulation.

Consider dp[i][0] as a base case, where we need to find if it's possible to make all elements in the first i elements of the array equal to 0. This will help us determine whether we can make all elements in the array equal to zero by decrementing a certain number of elements at a time.

Let's say we have made all elements from 0 to k-1 equal to zero. We can now either make the current element (at index k) equal to zero or leave it as is, then consider the remaining elements. This gives us two possible states: dp[k][0] and dp[k][1].

We need to find a way to determine whether we can make all elements in the array equal to zero by considering these two possibilities. If we can make all elements from 0 to k-1 equal to zero, it means that either the current element is already zero or we can decrement it to zero. We then need to consider the remaining elements and repeat this process until we reach the end of the array.

To implement memoization, define a function that takes an index k and returns True if it's possible to make all elements from 0 to k-1 equal to zero, and False otherwise. This will help us avoid redundant calculations by storing the results of subproblems in an array dp[].
