===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you explore all possible ways to make the array elements equal to zero from left to right and store the results in a memoized dictionary.

State: The current sum of elements in the array, considering all possible operations that can be applied to make the array equal to zero.
Transition:
    - If the current sum is greater than 0, apply an operation that would decrement the sum by 1 (i.e., remove the largest element from the left).
    - If the current sum is less than 0, apply an operation that would increment the sum by 1 (i.e., add the smallest element from the right).
    - If the current sum is exactly 0, do nothing.
Use a dictionary memo where memo[i] returns True if it's possible to make all elements in the array equal to zero considering only the first i elements, and False otherwise.

For each i from 1 to n:
    - Initialize memo[i-1] = False
    - If i is 1, set memo[0] = (a_1 == 0)
    - For each j from a_1 to a_i:
        - If j <= 0 and memo[j-1], return True
        - If j >= 0 and memo[i-j-1], return True
    - Return memo[i-1]
