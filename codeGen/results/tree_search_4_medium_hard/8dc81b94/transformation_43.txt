===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's an optimal substructure for this problem, where making one part of the array equal to zero is sufficient to solve the entire problem, allowing you to apply dynamic programming using tabulation.

Consider dp[i][0] as a base case, where we need to find if it's possible to make all elements in the first i elements of the array equal to 0. This represents the state where no operations have been performed yet.

Let's say we have made all elements from 0 to k-1 equal to zero. We can now either make the current element (at index k) equal to zero or leave it as is, then consider the remaining elements. This gives us two possible states: dp[k][0] and dp[k][1]. The state dp[k][0] represents that all elements from 0 to k have been made zero, while dp[k][1] means we haven't made any changes yet.

Use tabulation by initializing a 2D array dp where each cell dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to make all elements in the first i elements equal to zero after j operations, then fill up the table using dynamic programming. The base case would be dp[0][0] = true, because we can always make an empty array zero by performing 0 operations.

The recursive formula could be: if a[i] is the current element, then:
- If a[i] > 0 and it's possible to make all elements in the first i-1 equal to zero (dp[i-1][0]), then we can decrement a[i] and make all elements in the first i equal to zero.
- If a[i] <= 0 or it's not possible to make all elements in the first i-1 equal to zero (dp[i-1][j]), then we have two choices: either leave a[i] as is and consider the remaining elements, or decrement a[i] and try to make all elements in the first i-1 equal to zero.

Finally, iterate through the array from left to right and update the dp table based on this recursive formula. If at any point it's possible to make all elements in the first i equal to zero after j operations (dp[i][j]), then we can output "YES" for that test case.
