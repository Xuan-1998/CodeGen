===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you iteratively fill a 2D table dp with the minimum number of operations required to make elements equal to zero up to indices i and j.
Define the state as a tuple (i, j) representing the current indices into the array, where i is the index from the start of the array and j is the index from the end of the array.
Formulate the problem as a dynamic programming problem. Let dp[i][j] be the minimum number of operations required to make elements equal to zero up to indices i and j.
Base case: For dp[0][n-1], if all elements are already zero, return 0; otherwise, return -1 (impossible).
Fill the table using a bottom-up approach. For each pair (i, j), calculate the minimum number of operations required by considering two possibilities:
    * Decrement an element from the start: dp[i-1][j] + 1
    * Decrement an element from the end: dp[i][j-1] + 1
Return "YES" if there's a path that leads to all elements being equal to zero (i.e., dp[n-1][n-1] is less than or equal to 0); otherwise, return "NO".
