===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you build up the solution by considering all possible ways to make the array elements equal to zero.

State: The current sum of elements in the array, and whether the end or start of the array is being processed. 
Transition: Apply an operation that either decrements the total sum from the start of the array, or increments it from the end of the array.
Use dynamic programming by creating a 2D table dp[i][s] where i represents the current element in the array and s represents the current sum.

The base case is when the entire array has been processed (i.e., all elements are zero). In this case, the problem becomes trivial, as the sum is already zero.
Fill up the dp table by iterating over each element in the array. For each element, consider all possible sums that can be achieved by decrementing or incrementing from either end of the array.

The final answer is YES if there exists a way to make the entire array equal to zero, and NO otherwise.
