===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you iteratively build up solutions for arrays with fewer and fewer elements, storing the results in a memoized dictionary.

Define the state as a boolean indicating whether it's possible to make the array equal to zero by applying operations, with base cases being arrays that are already equal to zero or have only one element.

Model the problem as a 2D table dp[n][k], where n is the length of the array and k is the maximum number of operations allowed. dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to make the first i elements of the array equal to zero using at most j operations.

Formulate state transitions as follows:
- If the current element is 0, you can always make all elements equal to 0 with 0 operations.
- If the current element is greater than 0 and j > 0, you can try making it equal to 0 by applying one more operation, or leave it as is. dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] && a[i] <= k) || dp[i-1][j]
- If the current element is less than 0 and j > 0, you can try making all elements equal to 0 by applying one more operation, or leave it as is. dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] && a[i] >= -k) || dp[i-1][j]

Create a dictionary to store the results of subproblems, and update the dictionary as you solve each subproblem.

Finally, check whether it's possible to make all elements equal to 0 by applying at most k operations. If dp[n][k] is true, then "YES" should be printed; otherwise, print "NO".
