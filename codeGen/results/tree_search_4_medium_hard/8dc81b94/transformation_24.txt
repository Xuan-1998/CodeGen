===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach using a 2D table, where the number of rows represents the array length and the number of columns represents the number of operations applied so far.

Let dp[i][j] be a boolean indicating whether it's possible to make the first i elements of the array equal to zero by applying at most j operations.

Base cases:
- For arrays with only one element, it's always possible to make them equal to zero.
- For empty arrays, it's also possible to make them equal to zero.

State transitions:
- If it's possible to make the first i-1 elements of the array equal to zero by applying at most j operations, and the ith element is greater than 0, then it's possible to make all i elements equal to zero by applying at most j+1 operations.
- If it's possible to make the first i-1 elements of the array equal to zero by applying at most j operations, and the ith element is less than or equal to 0, then it's also possible to make all i elements equal to zero by applying at most j operations.

Initialize dp[0][j] for all j to True.
Fill in dp[i][j] values recursively based on state transitions.

Finally, check if dp[n][j] is True for some j. If it is, then it's possible to make the array equal to zero; otherwise, it's not.
