===BEGIN PLAN===
Look into whether there's a recursive relationship between smaller problems and larger ones, which could be solved by memoizing the results. 
Consider the state expression dp[n] = (dp[n-1] or dp[0]) because either we can decrement elements from the end of the array, or we have already processed the entire array and made all elements equal to zero.
Maintain two pointers, one at the start and another at the end, and recursively check if it's possible to make all elements between them equal to zero. 
Memoize by defining a recursive function that stores its own results in a dictionary before performing computations. 

For each pair of (n, total), consider the minimum number of operations required to make all elements equal to zero from the start or end.
If we decrement an element at the end, the new total will be one less than the previous total. 
If we decrement an element at the start, the new total will be one more than the previous total.
Recursively check if it's possible to make all elements between them equal to zero with the new total and n-1 or 0 respectively.

Update dp[n] to be the minimum of the above two cases plus 1. 
If the answer is yes, we have found a way to make all elements in the array equal to zero.
If the answer is no, it's not possible.
