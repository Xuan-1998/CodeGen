===BEGIN PLAN===
Look into whether there's a recursive relationship between smaller problems and larger ones, which could be solved by memoizing the results.
Let the state expression be dp[i][j] = True if it's possible to make all elements in the subarray a[i..j] equal to zero, and False otherwise.
The state transition can be updated based on whether or not it is possible to make all elements in the subarray a[0..i-1] equal to zero.
Let dp[i][j] = True if either (a) dp[0][j] is True and sum(a[i..j]) <= 0, or (b) there exists k such that i <= k < j and dp[k][j] is True and sum(a[i..k]) - sum(a[k+1..j]) <= 0.
The base case can be dp[0][i] = (sum(a[0..i]) <= 0).
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with a 2D table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] is True if it's possible to make all elements in the subarray a[i..j] equal to zero.
Initialize the base case and fill up the dp table accordingly, then return whether or not dp[0][n-1] is True.
