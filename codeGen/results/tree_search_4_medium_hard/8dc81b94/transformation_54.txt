===BEGIN PLAN===
Let the state expression be dp[i] = True if it's possible to make all elements in a[i..n-1] equal to zero, and False otherwise.
The base case is when i == n - 1. In this case, we can check if all elements are already zero, which means it's always possible.
For the recursive case, let dp[j] be True if it's possible to make all elements in a[j..n-1] equal to zero. Then we can update dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] and (sum(a[0..i - 1]) == sum(a[0..j]) or sum(a[0..i - 1]) + n - i <= sum(a[j..n - 1]))) or False.
We use memoization to store the results of subproblems, so we don't need to recompute them. The final answer is dp[0].
