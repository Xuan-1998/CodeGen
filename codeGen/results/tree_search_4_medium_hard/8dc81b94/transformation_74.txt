===BEGIN PLAN===
Look into whether there's a recursive relationship between smaller problems and larger ones, which could be solved by memoizing the results.
Consider the state expression dp[n] = (dp[n-1] or any(a[0] > 0)) as we can either process the entire array and decrement elements from the beginning if there are non-zero elements at the start, or process the remaining part of the array and make all elements equal to zero by decrementing elements from the end.
Formulate state dp[n] = (dp[n-1] or (dp[0] and any(a[i] > 0 for i in range(n))))
Apply memoization to a recursive function that takes into account the current state of the array and the number of elements decremented so far, using bottom-up dynamic programming.
