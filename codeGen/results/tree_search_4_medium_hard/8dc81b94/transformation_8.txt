===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach with memoization.

Define the state as (i, j) representing the current indices into the array, where i is the index from the start and j is the index from the end. The goal is to find whether there's a path that leads to all elements being equal to zero.

Formulate the problem as follows:

* Let dp[i][j] represent whether it's possible to make all elements between indices i and j equal to zero.
* Initialize dp[0][n-1] = True, since we can decrement the last element to zero from either end.
* For each element a[k] in the array:
	+ If k is at the start of the array (i=0), then consider decrementing it from the start: dp[i][k-1] = True if possible.
	+ If k is at the end of the array (j=n-1), then consider decrementing it from the end: dp[k+1][j]=True if possible.
	+ Otherwise, consider both options and take the minimum: dp[i][k-1] or dp[k+1][j]
* Return dp[0][n-1]

This approach ensures that we don't recompute the same subproblems multiple times, reducing time complexity.
