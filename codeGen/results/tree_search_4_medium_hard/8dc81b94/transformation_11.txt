===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you iteratively build up solutions from smaller subproblems.

State: The remaining number of elements to process
Transition: For each element in the array, decide whether to decrement it or skip it. If the element is decremented, subtract 1 from its value; otherwise, do nothing.

To use dynamic programming and maintain a recursive function with memoization:
