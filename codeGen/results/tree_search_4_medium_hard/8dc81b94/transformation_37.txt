===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's an optimal substructure for this problem, where making one part of the array equal to zero is sufficient to solve the entire problem, allowing you to apply dynamic programming using tabulation.

Consider dp[i][0] as a base case, where we need to find if it's possible to make all elements in the first i elements of the array equal to 0.

dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to make all elements from index 1 to i-1 (or i+1) equal to zero, given that the element at index j in the array is not changed.

Implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach using a 2D table where dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to make all elements from index 1 to i-1 (or i+1) equal to zero given that the element at index j in the array is not changed, and update this value based on the values of adjacent cells.

For each cell dp[i][j], calculate the minimum number of operations required to make all elements from index 1 to i-1 (or i+1) equal to zero. This can be done by considering two options: either decrement the element at index j, or skip it and proceed with the remaining array.

Update the values in the dp table based on these calculations.

Finally, check if the value of dp[n][0] is 0 or 1, depending on whether making all elements equal to zero is possible or not. If it's 0, return "YES", otherwise return "NO".
