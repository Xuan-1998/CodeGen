===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's an optimal substructure for this problem, where making one part of the array equal to zero is sufficient to solve the entire problem, allowing you to apply dynamic programming using tabulation.

Define dp[i][k] as true if and only if for every j <= k, it is possible to make all elements in the first i-1 elements of the array equal to j. However, this definition might not capture the correct condition. Instead, consider defining dp[i][k] as true if and only if it's possible to make all elements in the entire array (not just the first i-1 elements) equal to k.

dp[i][k] should be true if and only if for every j <= k, it is possible to make all elements in the entire array equal to j. This definition ensures that making all elements equal to k is achievable from any element in the array.

Use a 2D array dp where dp[i][k] represents whether it's possible to make all elements in the entire array equal to k, and for every j <= k, it is possible to make all elements in the entire array equal to j. This ensures that the dynamic programming approach can capture the correct condition.
