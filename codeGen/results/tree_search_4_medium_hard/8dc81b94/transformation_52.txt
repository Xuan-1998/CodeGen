This way we can build up the solution from smaller subproblems.
We iterate over all possible lengths of the subarray, from smallest to largest. 
For each length i, we consider all possible starting positions j. 
If we can make all elements in the subarray a[j...i-1] equal to zero and if the element at index j - 1 is greater than zero (which means it needs to be decreased), then we can also make all elements in a[j...i] equal to zero.
