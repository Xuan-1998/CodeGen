===BEGIN PLAN===
Look into whether there's a recursive relationship between smaller problems and larger ones, which could be solved by memoizing the results.

Consider the state expression dp[n] = (dp[n-1] or dp[0]) because either we can decrement elements from the end of the array, or we have already processed the entire array and made all elements equal to zero.

Think about maintaining two pointers, one at the start and another at the end, and recursively check if it's possible to make all elements between them equal to zero. This could be done by filling a 2D table dp[i][j] where each cell represents whether it's possible to make all elements in the range [i, j] equal to zero.

Fill this table bottom-up, starting from smaller ranges and gradually moving towards larger ones. For example, dp[1][1] would be true because we can always decrement an array with one element to make it equal to zero.

Then, use these values to fill in the rest of the table. For instance, for a range [i, j], we can check if it's possible by considering the two cases: either we decrement the start or end, and recursively check if the remaining range is possible. If both are true, then dp[i][j] should be true.

Finally, answer "YES" if dp[0][n-1] is true (i.e., it's possible to make all elements equal to zero), and "NO" otherwise.
