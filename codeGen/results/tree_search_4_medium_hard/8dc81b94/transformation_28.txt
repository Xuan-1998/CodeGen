===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's an optimal substructure for this problem, where making one part of the array equal to zero is sufficient to solve the entire problem, allowing you to apply dynamic programming using tabulation.

Let dp[i][k] represent whether it's possible to make all elements in the first i elements of the array equal to k.

dp[i][k] = (all(a_j <= a_i) && a_i >= 0 || dp[i-1][k+(a_i-k)%2] && all(a_j < a_i)) || (all(a_j >= a_i) && a_i <= 0 || dp[i-1][k-(a_i-k)%2] && all(a_j > a_i));

Use a 2D DP table with dimensions (n+1, max(a)+1) to store the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the first i elements of the array equal to k, and then use this DP table to find the answer.
