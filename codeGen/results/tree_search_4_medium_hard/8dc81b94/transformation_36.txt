===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's an optimal substructure for this problem, where making one part of the array equal to zero is sufficient to solve the entire problem, allowing you to apply dynamic programming using tabulation.

Consider dp[i][0] as a base case, where we need to find if it's possible to make all elements in the first i elements of the array equal to 0.
dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to make all elements from index 1 to i-1 (or i+1) equal to zero, given that the element at index j in the array is not changed.

Use a memoization dictionary to store the results of subproblems and check if they're already solved before solving them recursively.
If dp[i][0] is true, it means we can make all elements in the first i elements equal to 0. Then, for each element at index j, 
check if there's an optimal solution where the current element remains unchanged (dp[i-1][j]) and the remaining part of the array (i+1) also has an optimal solution (dp[n-i-1][0]). If both conditions are met, then we can make all elements in the first i elements equal to 0.

If dp[i][1] is true, it means we cannot make all elements in the first i elements equal to 0. In this case, 
consider two possibilities: either decrementing the last element or incrementing the first element. 
For each possibility, check if there's an optimal solution for the remaining part of the array (dp[n-i-1][0]) and the current operation (dec/inc) does not create a cycle.

If we find a valid optimal solution, return "YES", otherwise return "NO".
