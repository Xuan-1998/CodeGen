===BEGIN PLAN===
Look into whether there's a recursive relationship between smaller problems and larger ones, which could be solved by memoizing the results.

Define dp[i] as True if it is possible to make the first i elements equal to zero. Then, we can define the base case as follows:

dp[0] = True because an empty array is already equal to zero.
dp[i] = False for i > 0 and a1 > 0 or a[n-1] > 0, where a1 and a[n-1] are the first and last elements of the array.

Consider using a two-pointer approach with one pointer at the beginning of the array (j) and another at the end (k). Update dp[i] based on whether the difference between the elements at these positions is decreasing or not. We can do this by iterating over all possible subarrays [a[j...i], a[0...n-i-1]], where j = 0, i = n-1 and k = n-1, i = 0.

Define dp[i] as follows:

dp[i] = True if min(a[j...i]) - max(a[0...n-i-1]) <= 0. Otherwise, dp[i] = False.

The state is updated based on whether the difference between the elements at these positions is decreasing or not. If it's always decreasing, then we can make all elements equal to zero by decrementing elements from either end of the array. If not, then we cannot do that and dp[i] will be set as False.

This approach ensures that we don't miss any edge cases and provides a way to handle larger arrays.
