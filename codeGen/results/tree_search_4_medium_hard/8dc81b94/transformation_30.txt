===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's an optimal substructure for this problem, where making one part of the array equal to zero is sufficient to solve the entire problem, allowing you to apply dynamic programming using tabulation.

Let dp[i][k] represent whether it's possible to make all elements in the first i elements of the array equal to k.

dp[i][k] = (dp[i-1][k-a_i%2] && a_i <= k) || (dp[i-1][k+a_i%2] && a_i >= k);

Dynamically update the table dp by considering all possible operations that can be applied to the current element and recursively updating the subproblem for the remaining elements.

Update plan:
Let dp[i][0] represent whether it's possible to make all elements in the first i elements of the array equal to 0. Then, we can use a dynamic programming approach with two dimensions:

dp[i][0] = (i == 0 || (a_i % 2 == 0 && dp[i-1][0]) || (a_i % 2 != 0 && dp[i-1][1]));

For k > 0, if the current element is even, we can make it equal to 0 by applying the operation; otherwise, we need to make it equal to 1. Then, update the subproblem for the remaining elements.

dp[i][k] = (a_i % 2 == 0 && dp[i-1][0]) || (a_i % 2 != 0 && dp[i-1][k-1]);

Finally, return "YES" if dp[n][0], and "NO" otherwise.
