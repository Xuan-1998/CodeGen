===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you fill up a table with solutions for all possible sums of the array elements.
Define the state as the current sum of the array elements, and formulate state transitions based on how this value changes as you process each element.
Base case: If the sum is zero or the absolute difference between any two elements in the array is greater than or equal to half the maximum possible value in the array (which can be calculated from the maximum element in the array), then it's impossible to make all elements equal to zero. 
If not, then consider subtracting the minimum element from the sum and recursively explore making the remaining elements equal to zero.
If this is possible, then add the answer back with an additional operation of subtracting the minimum element.
Else, try adding the maximum element to the sum and recursively explore making the remaining elements equal to zero.
If this is possible, then add the answer back with an additional operation of adding the maximum element.
Finally, if all operations fail, return "NO".
