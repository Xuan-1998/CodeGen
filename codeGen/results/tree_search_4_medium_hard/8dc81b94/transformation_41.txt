===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a 2D array dp where dp[i][0] represents whether it's possible to make all elements in the first i elements equal to zero, and dp[i][1] represents the minimum number of operations needed.

Let dp[i][0] be true if it's possible to make all elements in the first i elements equal to zero. Then:

- If a_1 = 0, dp[1][0] is always true.
- For i > 1, consider two cases:
    1. Make a_i = 0: dp[i][0] is true if and only if a_{i-1} = 0 (since we've already made a_{i-1} equal to zero).
    2. Leave a_i as it is: dp[i][0] is true if and only if dp[i-1][0] is true.

Now, consider the minimum number of operations needed (dp[i][1]):
- If a_1 = 0, we need 0 operations.
- For i > 1:
    - Make a_i = 0: We've already made all elements from 0 to i-1 equal to zero. So dp[i][1] is simply the minimum number of operations needed for the subarray from 0 to i-1, which is dp[i-1][1].
    - Leave a_i as it is: If we leave a_i as it is, then the minimum number of operations needed is just the minimum number of operations needed for the subarray from 0 to i-2 (dp[i-1][1]) plus one operation.

Finally, dp[n][0] will be true if and only if it's possible to make all elements in the array equal to zero. And dp[n][1] will give us the minimum number of operations needed to do so.
