===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you iteratively explore all possible ways to make the array elements equal to zero, and store the results in a memoized dictionary.

State: The remaining number of elements to process.
Transition:
    1. Process one element from either end of the array.
    2. Apply no operation (i.e., skip the current step).

Memoization key: The sum of elements processed so far, considering all possible operations that can be applied to make the array equal to zero.

Base case: When there are no more elements to process, it is guaranteed that the array elements will be equal to zero if the total sum becomes zero.

Step-by-step procedure:
    1. Initialize a memoized dictionary dp with default value as False.
    2. Iterate over all possible sums from the maximum possible sum (sum of all array elements) down to the minimum possible sum (0).
        For each sum, calculate the remaining number of elements needed to process to make the total sum equal to zero.
        If this remaining number is less than or equal to the current number of elements, recursively explore all possible ways to process these remaining elements and store the results in dp.
    3. Return "YES" if dp[0] is True; otherwise, return "NO".
