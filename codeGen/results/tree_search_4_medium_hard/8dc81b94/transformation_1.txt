===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you build up the solution by considering all possible ways to make the array elements equal to zero from indices 0 and n-1, and store the results in a table or array.
Define the state as a boolean value representing whether it is possible to make all elements of the subarray [0..i] (or [n-i..n-1]) equal to zero. The base case for this recursive problem would be when i is 0 or n-1, at which point you can simply return True if all elements in that subarray are already 0.
The transition relationship can be formulated as follows: 
- If the current element at index i (or n-i) is greater than 0, then you have two choices - either decrement it and move to the next element, or skip it and move to the previous element. In this case, you would return False, because it's not possible to make all elements equal to zero.
- If the current element at index i (or n-i) is 0, then you can simply move to the next element.
Use dynamic programming to fill up the table in a bottom-up manner, and use this information to determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the original array equal to zero.
