===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to make all elements in the first i positions of the array equal to zero if we can decrement up to j elements from the end.

Let dp[i][0] be true for all i, because we can always make all elements in the first i positions equal to zero by not decrementing any elements (i.e., leaving them as is).

For 1 <= k <= n, consider the following recursive relationship:

dp[i][k] = (min(dp[i-1][k-1], dp[i][0]) or min(dp[0][k-1], dp[i-1][0]))

This means that we can either decrement elements from the beginning of the array, or decrement elements from the end, or do both.

Use dynamic programming to fill up the DP table. For each cell dp[i][j], calculate its value based on the values in the cells above it and to the left of it.

Finally, return "YES" if dp[n][0] is true, and "NO" otherwise.
