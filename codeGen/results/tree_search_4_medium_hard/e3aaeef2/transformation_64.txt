===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum length of the resulting number after i operations, given that the initial number has j digits. The base case is dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since no digits are needed initially.

The recursive relation is dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j-1] + ceil(log10(j)) + (i-k)) for k from 0 to i, where each operation adds a constant number of digits. The ceiling function is used to ensure that the minimum length is considered.

Implement a memoized solution with base case when n or m is 0.
