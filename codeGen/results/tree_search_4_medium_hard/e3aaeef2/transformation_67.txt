===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating intermediate results for each length and number of operations.
The base case is dp[0][j] = 1 for all j, since one digit is needed initially (the leading 1).
Consider two consecutive states: dp[i][j] and dp[i+1][j], where the transition is given by adding one more digit to the previous state. If the number of digits in the current state is i, then the next operation will add at least one new digit; otherwise, the length remains the same.
Determine the optimal substructure: the optimal solution for each state depends only on the previous states and not on any other information.
Identify overlapping subproblems: since the problem allows applying multiple operations, it's possible to apply the same operation multiple times, which leads to overlapping subproblems. To avoid this, we can maintain a separate table dp2[i][j] that stores the length of the resulting number after applying m operations and consider only one operation at a time.
Consider edge cases: n = 0 or m = 0 should be handled separately, as they would result in different outputs (0 for both).
