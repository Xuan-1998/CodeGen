===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

State: Define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of digits required to represent the result after j operations on an i-digit number. We can use a 2D array to store these values.

Transition relationship:
dp[n][m] = min(dp[n-1][m-1], n + ceil(log10(n)) - dp[n-1][m])

where ceil(log10(n)) is the maximum possible increase in the length of the number after an operation, and dp[n-1][m-1] represents the minimum number of digits required for the (n-1)-digit number after m-1 operations.

Use a hashmap to store the previously computed values to avoid redundant calculations. This can be done by using a priority queue to keep track of the states with the smallest remaining number of operations, and updating the dp array accordingly.

Edge cases: 
* For n = 0 or m = 0, return 1 because there is no operation left.
* For n > 10^9, return -1 because the maximum possible length of the number exceeds the limit.
