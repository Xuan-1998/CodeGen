===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

State expression: The state of the current number is represented by a tuple (n, m), where n is the value of the number and m is the remaining operations. 

Base case: When m is 0, the state is processed.

Recursion:
1. If m is 0, return the length of the processed number.
2. Otherwise, recursively call the function with the updated number (apply the operation) and decrement the remaining operations by 1.

Memoization: Store the results for each operation in a dictionary to avoid redundant computation.

Edge cases:
1. Handle the case when n is 0 or less, as there are no digits to process.
2. Handle the case when m is negative, as it doesn't make sense to apply more operations than available.
