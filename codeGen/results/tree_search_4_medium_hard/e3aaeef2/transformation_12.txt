===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

The state is defined by the length and value of the current number, considering all possibilities for the last digit. Base case is when n is a single digit.

You can represent the state as (n, val) where n is the length of the current number and val is the value after an operation is applied. Then the transition relationship can be formulated based on whether the last digit of val + 1 has more or less digits than the previous last digit.

Memoize the state (n, val) with a dictionary where keys are states and values are lengths after m operations. Use a helper function to update the state based on whether the last digit of val + 1 has more or less digits than the previous last digit.

Use the base case as the initial state for memoization, and fill up the memoization table by iterating over all possible combinations of n and m. Then return the length after applying m operations modulo 10^9+7 for each test case.
