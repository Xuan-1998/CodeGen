===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using both top-down and bottom-up approaches with memoization.
The state expression could be dp[n][m] where dp[i][j] represents the length of number i after j operations.
state: (n, m), transition relation:
    if m > 0:
        f((n, m)) = max(dp[n % 10][m - 1], f((int(n / 10), m - 1))) + 1
    else:
        f((n, m)) = 1

The problem can be solved using a bottom-up approach with tabulation.
Fill up the dp table from bottom to top. The base case is when there are no more operations (i.e., m == 0).
For each cell in the table, iterate over each digit d of n and compute the length of the resulting number after applying the operation.

Initialize the dp table with all zeros, then fill it up using a loop.
The base case for the recursion is when there are no more operations (i.e., m == 0).
For each cell in the table, iterate over each digit d of n and compute the length of the resulting number after applying the operation.

To avoid overflow, use modular arithmetic to update the dp table.
When computing the result, add 1 to it and take modulo 10^9+7 for the final answer.

The plan does not include edge cases. It should be extended to handle edge cases like n == 0 or m == 0 separately.
