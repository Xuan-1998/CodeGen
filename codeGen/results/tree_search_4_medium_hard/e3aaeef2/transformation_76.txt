===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a top-down approach with memoization, where the state is the current number and the base case is when there are no more operations.

The state expression could be dp[n][m] where dp[i][j] represents the length of number i after j operations.

dp[n][m] represents the length of number n after m operations, and the recurrence relation is:

    code = 1 + sum(dp[k][j-1] for k in digits(i))

Implementing a dynamic programming solution by creating a 2D table where dp[n][m] represents the length of number n after m operations and using the recurrence relation to fill up the table.

The initial values would be:

    dp[i][0] = len(str(i))

To avoid repeated computations, we can use memoization. The recursive function would look like this:

    def solve(n, m, memo={}):
        if (n,m) in memo:
            return memo[(n,m)]
        if m == 0:
            return len(str(n))
        result = 1 + sum(solve(k, m-1, memo) for k in str(n))
        memo[(n,m)] = result
        return result

Finally, we can use a loop to iterate over the test cases and print the answer:

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(solve(n, m) % (10**9+7))
