===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

The base case is dp[0][j] = 1 for all j, since there are no digits initially.

Let dp[i][j-1] represent the length of number i after applying j-1 operations. Then dp[i][j] is equal to the maximum of the lengths of numbers obtained by replacing each digit d of i with the decimal representation of integer d + 1.

The recursive relation can be written as: 
dp[i][j] = min(dp[Math.floor(i/10)][j-1], (i%10) + 1)

If i > 0, else dp[0][j].

To avoid unnecessary computation and improve efficiency, we can use memoization to store the intermediate results.

The plan is correct, but it should be adjusted to handle the cases where i < 10. In that case, no digit needs to be replaced, so dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]. 

The edge cases are handled by initializing dp[0][j] to 1 for all j.

Here's the updated plan:
