===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a top-down approach with memoization and bottom-up dynamic programming.

The state expression could be dp[n][m] where dp[i][j] represents the length of number i after j operations.

dp(i, 0) = 1 (base case when there are no more operations)
dp(i, m) = min(dp(10d + (i // 10^(len(str(i))-1-k)) % 10), k from 0 to len(str(i))-1) for each digit d in i

Implementing memoization using a dictionary where keys are the states and values are the corresponding results.

For edge cases, consider n or m being zero.
