===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

State: Define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of digits required to represent the result after j operations on an i-digit number. The state is defined as (n, m) where n is the current number and m is the remaining number of operations.

Transition relationship: dp[n][m] = min(dp[k][m-1] for k in range(10**(n-1), 10**n)), where the minimum is taken over all possible numbers k that can be obtained from the current number n by applying one operation. This can be done iteratively, starting from base cases of dp[1][j] = 1 and dp[n][0] = n for 1 <= n <= 9.

Memoization: Use a recursive function to calculate the minimum number of digits required to represent the result after j operations on an i-digit number. This can be done by initializing a memo array with values initialized as infinity, then updating the values based on the transition relationship and memoizing the results.

Edge cases:
- Initialize base cases for dp[1][j] = 1 and dp[n][0] = n for 1 <= n <= 9.
- Handle edge case where m == 0 by returning the initial number of digits required to represent n.
- Handle edge case where j > 0 but there are no more operations left, in which case we should return the current result.
