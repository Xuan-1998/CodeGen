===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

State expression: Define the state as the decimal representation of the current number, with the base case being when the decimal representation has no more than one digit.
Let's denote the initial state (n, 0) where n is the initial number, and the result after m operations as (l, v).

Define a function applyOp(n, m, memo): 
    - If m == 0, return (n, n)
    - Initialize (l, v) = (1, n) // start with the initial state
    - For each digit d of n:
        - Calculate d + 1 and convert it to a string str
        - Calculate the new length l' as the number of digits in str + l - 1 (accounting for the leading digit)
        - If memo[(l', str)] exists, return memo[(l', str)]
        - Calculate v' = str * 10^(l'-1) + v % 10^9+7
        - Update (l, v) = (l', v')
    - Return (l, v)

Memoize the function applyOp(n, m, memo)
Apply the operation recursively until m == 0
Return the result after applying m operations
