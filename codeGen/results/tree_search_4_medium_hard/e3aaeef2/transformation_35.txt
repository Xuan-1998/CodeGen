===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

State: Define dp[i][j] as the length of the resulting number when starting with a number of i digits and applying j operations. 
The state can be defined as (i, j) where i is the current number of digits and j is the current number of operations.
Memoize the function using a dictionary where the key is the current state (i, j) and the value is the result for that state.

For initialization, set dp[1][0] to 1 because the starting number with one digit will always remain as it is. 
Set dp[i][0] to i + 1 for all i > 1 because each operation increases the length by at least 1.
Finally, fill in the dp table based on the following recurrence relation: 
dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j - 1] + 1) for k from 1 to i

Print the value of dp[n][m] as the final answer
