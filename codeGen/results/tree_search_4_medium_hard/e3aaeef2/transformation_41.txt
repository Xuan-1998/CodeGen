===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

State: Define dp[i][j] as the length of the resulting number when starting with a number of i digits and applying j operations. 

dp[1][0] = 1, since one-digit numbers do not change in one operation.
If n is less than or equal to 9 (i.e., all single-digit), then dp[n][m] = m + 1.

For lengths greater than 1, we consider the last digit of the number. If it's less than 9, then applying an operation results in a new number with the same length; if it's 9, then applying an operation makes it 0 and the next digit is considered.
Use memoization by storing the intermediate results in a dictionary where the keys are tuples (i, j) and the values are the lengths of the resulting numbers.

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] if the last digit of n is less than 9
dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 if the last digit of n is 9

Return dp[n][m]
