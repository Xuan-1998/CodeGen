if i > 0

Implement top-down memoization using dictionary where the keys are tuples of current number and operations left and values are results of computations.

For edge cases, we need to handle when n or m is 0. In this case, return 0 as there will be no changes to the number.

For handling overflow, we can use a large integer variable to store the result before printing it modulo 10^9+7.

The plan can be improved by implementing memoization more efficiently. For example, using a dictionary with tuple keys and values that are computed on demand can improve the performance of the code.

The potential issues with this plan include handling overflow when computing the result and edge cases where n or m is 0.

Here is the updated version of the plan:
