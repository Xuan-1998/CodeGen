===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

State: Define dp[i][j] as the length of the resulting number after applying j operations on a number with i digits.

Transition relationship:
  1. For each operation, iterate over each digit d in the current number.
  2. Check if d is greater than or equal to 9. If so, set d to (d % 10) + 1 (reduce the result to [0-9]) and increment i by 1.
  3. Otherwise, apply operation normally (set d to (d + 1) % 10).
  4. Update dp[i][j] based on the updated digits.

Use a dictionary to store the intermediate results for each length and number of operations, then update the states using these memoized values.

Edge cases: 
  1. Handle the case where n is less than or equal to 0.
  2. Handle the case where m is less than or equal to 0.
