===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

State expression: Define the state as the decimal representation of the current number, and the base case is when the decimal representation has no more than one digit.

Consider the state as the tuple (length, value) where length is the current number of digits in the decimal representation of the number, and value is the actual value of the number.

Use a dictionary to store the results for each unique state

Update: Consider using a priority queue instead of memoization to efficiently update the states. This can be achieved by maintaining a heap where the priority is based on the length of the current number.
