===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its value and whether it has been fully processed (processed or not), with base case being when m is 0.

State expression: 
dp[i][j] = length of i-th number after applying j operations.
Base case: dp[0][m] = 1, since the initial number will always have a length of 1 after applying any operation.

Transition function:
For each operation, replace every digit d in the current number with decimal representation of integer d + 1 and apply j - 1 remaining operations to the new number. If m is 0, return 1.
dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] if j == 0
else: 
    temp = 0
    for digit in str(i):
        temp = (temp * 10 + int(digit) + 1) % (10^9+7)
    return dp[temp][j-1]

Memoization:
Use dictionary to store the results of each operation. The key is the state of the current number, and the value is the length of the i-th number after applying j operations.
dp = [[0 for _ in range(m+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]

Initialization: 
dp[0][j] = 1 for all j
dp[i][0] = 1 for all i

Final answer:
return dp[n][m]
