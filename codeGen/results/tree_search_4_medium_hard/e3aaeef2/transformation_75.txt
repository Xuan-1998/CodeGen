===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

State: Define dp[i][j] as the length of the resulting number after applying j operations on a number with i digits. This state can be computed directly without any need to consider maximum or minimum values, unlike initially thought.

Transition relationship: For each operation, apply it normally by replacing every digit d of the current number with the decimal representation of integer d + 1. The length of the resulting number is then simply the sum of the lengths of its digits.

Implement tabulation by creating a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the length of the resulting number after applying j operations on a number with i digits.
