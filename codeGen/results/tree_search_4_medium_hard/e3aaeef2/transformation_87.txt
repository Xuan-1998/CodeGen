The problem can be solved using a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming, where the state is the current number and its length after some operations.

The state expression could be dp[n][m] where dp[i][j] represents the length of the resulting number after j operations, considering all numbers from 1 to i. The base case is when there are no more operations (dp[i][0] = 0, since the length of the resulting number in this case is always 0) or when there's only one operation left (dp[i][1] = 1 if i has an odd number of digits and 2 otherwise).

Define a dynamic programming function with nested loops to fill up the dp table.

The main idea is that for each number i and operation count j, you can either apply the current operation and consider the next possible number k (if k <= n), or stop applying operations. The choice depends on whether the length of the resulting number after applying one more operation would be longer than stopping now.

Since the maximum possible value of n is 10^9 and m is 2 * 10^5, you can precompute all values from 0 to 1e9 for digits 0-9 and store them in an array. Then you just need to find the sum of these digit values modulo 10^9+7.

The state transitions are as follows:

* If j is even, then dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i/10^(dp[i][j-1]-1)][j-1]
* If j is odd, then dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i/10^(dp[i][j-1]-1)][j-1] if i has an odd number of digits; dp[i][j] = 2 otherwise

The final answer would be the value at dp[n][m] modulo 10^9+7.
