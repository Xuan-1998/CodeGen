===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple (length, value), where length is the current number of digits in the decimal representation of the number, and value is the actual value of the number.

State expression: The base case is when the decimal representation has no more than one digit. For larger numbers, consider breaking it down into smaller subproblems by treating each digit separately.

Memoize the function that applies one operation to a given state (length, value), storing the results for each operation.

Define a recursive function that takes as input the initial length and value, and the number of operations m. This function should return the final length modulo 10^9+7.

Apply memoization to avoid redundant calculations by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary or array, and checking if the result is already computed before calculating it.

Edge cases:
- The base case when the decimal representation has no more than one digit.
- When m becomes zero, the number doesn't change, so return the initial length.
