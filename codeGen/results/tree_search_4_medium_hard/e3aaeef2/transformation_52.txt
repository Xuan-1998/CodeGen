===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

State: Define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of digits required to represent the result after j operations on an i-digit number. The state is defined as (n, m) where n is the current number of digits and m is the remaining number of operations.

The transition relationship can be formulated as:
dp[n][m] = 1 + min(dp[k][m-1] for k in range(n)) if n > 0
else dp[0][m] = 1

Memoize a function that calculates the length of an integer after applying m operations to its digits, and use it to calculate the final result.

For each test case:
    Initialize dp with all values set to infinity
    Calculate dp[n][m]
    Print dp[n][m] modulo 10^9+7
