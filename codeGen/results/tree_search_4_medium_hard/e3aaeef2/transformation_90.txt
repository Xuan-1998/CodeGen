===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where the state is the current number and the base case is when there are no more operations.

The state expression could be dp[n][m] where dp[i][j] represents the length of the resulting number after j operations on a number with i digits. This is because we need to consider all numbers from 1 to n, and for each number, we need to apply m operations.

We can use the following recurrence relation:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j-1] + (k+1) for k in range(i)) if j > 0
else dp[0][0] = 1

The base case is when there are no more operations, i.e., j == 0.

We can start by initializing the memoization table with a size of n x m. Then, we fill up the table row by row from top to bottom, and column by column from left to right.

For each cell dp[i][j], we iterate over all possible digits k (from 1 to i) and calculate the length of the resulting number after applying j-1 operations on a number with k+1 digits. We then add 1 to this value because one more digit is added due to the operation.

Finally, we return dp[n][m] as our answer.
