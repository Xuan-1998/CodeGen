===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming, where the state is the current number and the base case is when there are no more digits in the number.

The state expression could be dp[n][m] where dp[i][j] represents the length of the resulting number after j operations on an i-digit number. The base case is when there are no more operations (dp[i][0] = i, since the length of the resulting number in this case is always equal to the number of digits). 

Use a dictionary to store the state values and retrieve them as needed for memoization.

The recursive formula can be dp[i][j+1] = 1 + sum(dp[k][j] for k in range(i)) where the sum represents the number of operations that will result in a new digit. The base case is when there are no more digits (dp[0][m] = 0).

Use a dictionary to store the state values and retrieve them as needed for memoization.

Finally, return dp[n][m]%10^9+7.
