===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

The base case is dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since no digits are needed initially.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of digits in the resulting number after applying j operations to an integer with i digits. The value of dp[i][j] can be calculated as follows:

- If j is 0 (i.e., no operations were performed), then dp[i][j] = i, because the length of the original integer remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, consider the last digit d of the integer with i digits. After applying one operation, this digit becomes d + 1. The number of digits in the resulting integer is either the same as before (if d + 1 has only one digit) or one more than before (if d + 1 has two digits). This means that dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i][j-1]) + 1.

This recursive formula can be used to fill the dynamic programming table, where dp[i][j] is calculated based on the values of dp[i-1][k] for k ranging from 0 to j-1. The final answer is the value of dp[n][m], which represents the minimum number of digits in the resulting number after applying m operations to an integer with n digits.
