===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where the state is the current number and the base case is when there are no more operations.

Let's define a function f(n, m) that represents the length of number n after m operations. The state expression could also be dp[n] where dp[i] represents the length of number i after m operations.

The idea is to build up a table dp[] such that dp[i] stores the length of number i after m operations. Then we can use this table to find the answer for the given problem.

Memoizing with a function f(n, m) to store the results of subproblems:
f(0, 0) = 1 (base case: no more operations and the number is already an integer)

Recurrence relation:
f(i, k) = 1 + ceil(log10(f(i % 9, k-1))) if i > 0
f(i, k) = f(0, k-1) if i == 0

Finally, we can calculate the answer as:
f(n, m)
