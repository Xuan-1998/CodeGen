===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

State: Define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of digits required to represent the result after j operations on an i-digit number. The state is defined as (n, m) where n is the current number and m is the remaining number of operations. 

The transition relationship can be formulated as:
dp[n][m] = min(dp[k][m-1] for k in range(10**(n-1), 10**n))

where the minimum is taken over all possible numbers k that can be obtained from the current number n by applying one operation.

To implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach using a 2D array to store the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

Initialize dp[0][j] = 1, representing the single-digit result after j operations on a 0-digit number. This is because there can be no digits in an empty string.

Fill up the dp table row by row starting from the first row: 

for n from 1 to 10^9:
    for m from 0 to 2*10^5:
        if n == 1:
            dp[n][m] = 1
        else:
            dp[n][m] = min(dp[k][m-1] for k in range(10**(n-1), 10**n))

Finally, print the length of the resulting number after m operations on an n-digit number as dp[n][m]%10^9+7.
