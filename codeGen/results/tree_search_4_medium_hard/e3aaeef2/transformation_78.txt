===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization and a bottom-up approach.

The state expression is dp[n][m] where dp[i][j] represents the length of number i after j operations.

The base case is when there are no more operations (i.e., m = 0), in which case the length of the number remains unchanged, so dp[i][0] = len(str(i)).

The recurrence relation is:

dp[i][m] = 1 + sum(dp[k][m-1] for k in str(i))

This can be implemented using a 2D array where dp[i][j] stores the length of number i after j operations, and then build up the table by iterating over all numbers from 1 to n and all operations from 0 to m.

Edge cases:
- n = 0: Since there is no initial number, return -1.
- m = 0: Since there are no more operations, return len(str(n)) (the length of the initial number).

The updated plan includes edge cases and addresses potential issues with the original plan. It also takes into account that the problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization.
