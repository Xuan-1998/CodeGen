===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

The base case is dp[0][j] = 1 for all j, since there are no digits initially. This ensures that we don't forget about edge cases where the initial number has zero digits.

dp[i][j] represents the length of number i after applying j operations

Define a recursive function f(i, j) to calculate dp[i][j]. The base case is when i or j becomes 0, at which point return 1 (no more digits) or the original value respectively.

Memoize the results by storing them in a 2D array dp[][] and update dp[i][j] using the recursive function. This ensures that we avoid redundant calculations and save time complexity.

To calculate f(i, j), consider each digit d of number i separately. If d is even, then applying one operation will increase its length by 1. If d is odd, applying one operation will increase its length by 2 since the next digit is 10 and not just incremented by 1.

Update dp[i][j] based on the maximum possible length of digits for i and j.

The final answer is the value at dp[n][m] modulo 10^9+7, which represents the length of number n after applying m operations.
