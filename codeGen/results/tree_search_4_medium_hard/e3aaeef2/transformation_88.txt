===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization, where the state is the current number and the base case is when there are no more operations.

The recursive relation could be:

dp[k] = 1 + min(dp[j] for j in range(k-1))

where dp[k] represents the length of the resulting number after k operations. The minimum is taken to ensure that we consider all possible intermediate results.

We can also maintain a dictionary memo to store the values of dp[k] for faster lookup.

The state expression could be dp[n][m] where dp[i][j] represents the length of the resulting number after j operations on a number with i digits, considering all numbers from 1 to n.

Using dynamic programming with memoization as dp[m], where dp[k] represents the length of the resulting number after k operations.
