===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, with base case being when m is 0.

State expression: dp[n][m] where n is the initial value of the number and m is the number of operations remaining to be performed.
The state represents the final length of the processed number after performing m operations on the initial number n.

Initialize a 2D table dp with dimensions (10^9 + 7) x (2 * 10^5), where each cell dp[n][m] stores the result for the initial value n and remaining operations m.
Base case: When m is 0, the length of the processed number is equal to the original length of the number. So, set dp[n][0] = log2(n) + 1.

Transition function:
- If m is even, apply the operation to every digit of the current number n and recursively call the function with the updated number and m/2.
- If m is odd, apply the operation to every digit of the current number n and recursively call the function with the updated number and (m - 1)/2.

Return dp[n][m] as the final answer.
