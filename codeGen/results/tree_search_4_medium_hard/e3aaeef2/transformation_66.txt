===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

The base case is dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since no digits are needed initially.

Consider two consecutive states: dp[i][j] and dp[i+1][j], where the transition is given by adding one more digit to the previous state.
Let's define f(x) as the number of digits in x after m operations. Then we can use the recurrence relation:

dp[i][j] = (f(dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1) % (10^9+7)

The memoization dictionary will store values like dp[i][j]. The goal is to find f(n) = dp[n][m].
