===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

State expression: Consider the current number as a tuple of its value and whether it has been fully processed (processed or not), with base case being when m is 0.

State expression:
	- Initialize memoization table: {length: {value: processed}}
	- Calculate new length after incrementing all digits by 1
	- Update the memoization table accordingly

Use a set to keep track of unique numbers and their corresponding lengths in the memoized table.

Pre-compute the result for each possible number length up to m, store it in a set, then use this set to get the final result. This will reduce time complexity.

Edge cases:
	- Handle initial condition when m is 0
	- Handle when n = 0 (since incrementing all digits by 1 doesn't change its value)

Improved plan:
	- Consider using bitwise operations instead of arithmetic operations for incrementing each digit, which could potentially be faster

Potential issues with the plan:
	- Handling edge cases might require additional logic
	- Memoization might lead to memory issues if the number of unique numbers exceeds the available memory
