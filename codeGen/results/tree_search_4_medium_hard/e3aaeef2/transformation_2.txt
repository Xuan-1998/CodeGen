===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its value and whether it has been fully processed (processed or not), with base case being when m is 0.

State expression: The current number's digits, where each digit can be either the original value or incremented by 1. This could lead to confusion, so let's simplify this state to just the length of the number and its value.

Apply dynamic programming by creating a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] stores the length of the number after applying i operations starting from j.
dp[0][j] = j
For each operation m:
    For every digit d in the current number's digits:
        Calculate the new value and length of the number after incrementing d by 1.
        Store this result in dp[m][length].
State transition: The state is updated as we go along, so no need to explicitly mention it.
