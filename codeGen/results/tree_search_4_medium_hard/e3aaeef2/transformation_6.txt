===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its value and length, use memoization to store the results for each operation.

State expression: (value, length)
Base case: when m is 0, return the initial number's length

Consider the increment operation applied to all digits in the number
Each digit can be either the original value or incremented by 1

Create a dictionary-based memoization approach using a custom function as the key and the result as the value

Function key: (n, m) -> calculate the next state after applying an operation
Memoized values:

* base case: when m is 0, return the initial number's length
* recursive case:
	+ if n is single digit, apply increment to all digits and return new length
	+ else, split into two parts, apply increment to each part separately, 
		   and combine results

Edge cases: handle inputs where n or m are extreme values (10^9, 2â‹…10^5)
