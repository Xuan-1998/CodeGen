===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

State expression: Define the state as (length, value), where length is the number of digits in the decimal representation of the current number, and value is the decimal representation itself. The base case is when the length is 1 or less.

State transition function: For a given state (length, value), apply one operation by replacing each digit d of the value with the decimal representation of integer d + 1. Update the length accordingly based on the number of digits in the resulting value.

Memoize the state transition function using a dictionary, mapping each state to its resulting state after applying one operation.

Edge cases: Handle cases where the initial number has less than or equal to 1 digit (i.e., it's already a single-digit number).

State optimization: To reduce the search space, consider pruning states that have already been visited during the memoization process.

Improved plan:
1. Initialize an empty dictionary for memoization.
2. Define the base case: if the initial length is less than or equal to 1, return it as the final result.
3. For each operation (m times):
    a. Apply one operation to the current state (length, value) by replacing each digit with d + 1 and updating the length accordingly.
    b. Check if the resulting state has already been visited in the memoization dictionary. If yes, return its stored result.
    c. Store the new state in the memoization dictionary for future reference.
4. Return the final result as the length of the resulting number modulo 10^9+7.
