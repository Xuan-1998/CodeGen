===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] represents the length of the resulting number after applying j operations on a number with i digits.

1. Initialize dp[0][j] = 0 for all j (0 ≤ j ≤ m) as there are no digits initially.
2. For each number of digits i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), calculate dp[i][0] = i, since the initial number has i digits.
3. Iterate over all possible combinations of i and j:
    - Initialize dp[i][j] to 0.
    - Calculate the new length of the resulting number after applying one operation on a number with i-1 digits (dp[i-1][j-1]).
    - Add the maximum digit value in the range [0, n) + 1 to get the new length for the current number of operations and digits. This represents the replacement of each digit with its successor.
    - Update dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j-1] + 1).
4. Return dp[n][m] as the maximum possible length of the resulting number after applying m operations on a number with n digits.
