===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

State expression: (length, value)
Base case: when m is 0

The state of the current number as a tuple of its value, with the increment operation applied to all digits, where each digit can be either the original value or incremented by 1.

Use a list-based memoization approach where each element is a tuple of the current number's length and its value.
Pre-compute the values for n = 0 to 10^9
Initialize the memo table with base cases: (m, n) -> 0

Main logic:
- If m is 0, return n
- Else, apply increment operation to each digit of n
- Check if the resulting number has been processed before; if so, return the cached result
- If not, recursively call the function with updated m and n values
- Cache the result for future use

Edge cases:
- Handle n = 0 separately (no digits to process)
- Handle m = 0 separately (no operations)
- Ensure memoization works correctly for edge cases
