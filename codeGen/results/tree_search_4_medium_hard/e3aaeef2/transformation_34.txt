===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

State: Define dp[i][j] as the length of the resulting number when starting with a number of i digits and applying j operations. The state can be defined as (i, j) where i is the current number of digits and j is the current number of operations.

Define dp[i][j] as the minimum length of the resulting number when starting with a number of i digits and applying j operations, considering all possible outcomes of each operation.

Edge case: Handle edge cases for n = 0 (initially) or m = 0 (no operations).

Pre-computation: Pre-compute the lengths of the resulting numbers for small initial values of n and m to speed up the computation.

Initialize: Initialize dp[1][j] with values from 1 to j, representing the length of the resulting number after applying j operations starting with a single-digit number (n = 1).

Transition: Define the transition function as follows:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][m-1] + ceil(log10(digit)) for k in range(1, i+1) and m-1 >= 0)

where digit is the decimal representation of integer d + 1 (the new digit after applying the operation), and k is the number of digits before the operation.

Base case: Set dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since starting with a zero-digit number will always result in a zero-digit number.

Final answer: Return dp[n][m] as the length of the resulting number modulo 10^9+7.
