===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

State expression: Define the state as the decimal representation of the current number, and the base case is when the decimal representation has no more than one digit.

State transition function: Given the current state (length l, value v), apply all possible operations by replacing each digit d of the number with the decimal representation of integer d + 1. Update the memoization dictionary accordingly.

Memoization: Store the results for each operation in a dictionary where the key is the state and the value is the result after applying one operation. Initialize the dictionary with the base case as the initial state.

Dynamic programming: Iterate through all possible states, apply the state transition function to each state, and update the memoization dictionary iteratively by considering all possible operations for each state.

State space pruning: Consider only states that are relevant for the problem (e.g., ignore states where the length is greater than 2 â‹… 10^5 or states where the value exceeds 10^9).

Base case: The base case is when the decimal representation has no more than one digit, which corresponds to a state with a single digit.

Output: For each test case output the length of the resulting number modulo 10^9+7.
