===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

The base case is dp[0][j] = 1 for all j, since one digit is needed initially to represent the number 1. This takes into account that the problem statement implies replacing every digit with its successor.

Let dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j-1] + ceil(log10(i-k+1))) for k from 0 to i, where each operation adds a constant number of digits based on the number of new digits introduced. This ceiling function is used to ensure that the minimum length calculated is always an integer.

Memoize the function that calculates the length after applying m operations, using a dictionary to store intermediate results. This will avoid recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.
