===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

State: Define dp[i][j] as the maximum possible length of the resulting number when applying j operations on a number with i digits. Initially, set dp[1][0] = 1, since there is only one digit in a single-digit number, and we apply 0 operations to it.

Transition relationship:
    1. For each operation, check if all digits in the current number are greater than 9.
        If so, apply operation and reduce the result to [0-9], then increment the count by 1. This means that at least one digit becomes 10 or more; hence, we increase the length of the resulting number.
        If not, apply operation normally, meaning all digits become less than 10, so the length remains the same.

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] stores the maximum possible length of the resulting number when applying j operations on a number with i digits. The base case is when we have no operations (m = 0), so we set dp[i][0] to i for all i.

State: Define f(n, m) as the function returning the length of the resulting number after applying m operations on an initial number n.

Function f(n, m):
    1. Initialize a variable res as the number of digits in the input number n.
    2. Iterate over each operation (0 to m-1).
        For each operation:
            Calculate the new value of n by iterating through its digits and replacing each digit d with d + 1, and then reducing any values greater than or equal to 10 back down to [0-9].
            Update res as the maximum possible length of the resulting number when applying the current number of operations on a number with this many digits.
    3. Return the value of res modulo 10^9+7.
