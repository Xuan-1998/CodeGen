===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

State: Define dp[i][j] as the maximum possible length of the resulting number when applying j operations on a number with i digits.

Base case: dp[0][j] = 0, because there are no digits in the initial number. For any positive integer k, if n < 10^9, then apply m operations to n and calculate the new maximum possible length.

Recursive relation: If we know the maximum possible length after applying j operations on a number with i-1 digits, then it can be applied to a number with i digits by adding 1 to each digit, which increases the length by 1. This relation is used to fill in the dp[i][j] table.

Memoization: Implement memoization by defining a dictionary where each key is a tuple (i, j) representing the current state and each value is the result of applying j operations to a number with i digits, and then using this dictionary to store and reuse intermediate results as you iterate over all combinations of i and j.

Edge cases:
1. If n = 0, m = 0, return 0.
2. If n < 10^9, apply m operations to n and calculate the new maximum possible length.
3. If n > 10^9, n is too large for the operation, so we can't handle it.
