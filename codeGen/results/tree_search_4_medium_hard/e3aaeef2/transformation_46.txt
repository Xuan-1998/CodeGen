===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of digits that can be obtained after applying j operations to an integer of i digits.
The base case is dp[0][j] = 1 for all j, since there are no digits initially.

dp[i][j] is equal to dp[i-1][j-1] * (i-1) if i contains only one digit, regardless of j. This is because a single-digit number remains the same after applying operations.
For general cases, calculate dp[i][j] as the maximum value between:
* dp[i-1][j] + 1: incrementing the last digit
* dp[i-1][j-1] * (i-1) if i contains only one digit

Use a 1D array max_length where max_length[j] is the maximum number of digits that can be obtained after applying j operations.
Initialize max_length[0] = 0, and then calculate each subsequent value as the maximum between:
* max_length[j-1]: no operation
* dp[i][j] + 1: apply one more operation

The answer is max_length[m] modulo 10^9+7.
