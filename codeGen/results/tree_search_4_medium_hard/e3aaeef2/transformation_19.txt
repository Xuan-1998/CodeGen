===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

State expression: 
  Define the state as the decimal representation of the current number. This is because every digit in the number will be incremented by one at each operation.
  The base case is when the decimal representation has no more than one digit.

State represents:
  The length of the number, since every operation adds at least one digit to the number.

Memoize the state (length and value) and update it after each operation
  Initialize a memoization dictionary with default value as -1.
  Iterate through the operations from m down to 0.
    For each operation:
      If the current length is not in the memoization, calculate the next length using the operation rule.
      Update the memoization dictionary.
