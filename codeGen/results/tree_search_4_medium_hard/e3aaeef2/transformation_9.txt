===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

The state is defined by the length and value of the current number, considering all possibilities for the last digit. 

Base case is when n is a single digit. You can consider the state as (n, val) where n is the length of the current number and val is its decimal value. The next state would be determined by applying the operation to each digit of val.

You can use a dictionary to store the results for each possible state (n, val) as you iterate over all possible states.

Let dp[i][j] denote the length of the resulting number after i operations when the initial number is j.

For base case, when n is a single digit, dp[0][k] = k where 1 <= k <= 9.

For each operation, consider applying the operation to each digit of val. The possible states are (n+1, val % 10) and (n-1, (val // 10) + 1), considering all possibilities for the last digit.

The dynamic programming state transition function is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k]) for k such that 0 <= k <= 9 and j % 10 == k+1 or j // 10 == k+1. 

Edge cases are handled by considering all possible states during the iteration.

The final answer would be dp[m][n].
