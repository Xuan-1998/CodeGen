===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

State: Define dp[i][j] as the length of the resulting number when starting with a number of i digits and applying j operations.

Define the state as (n, m) where n is the initial number and m is the number of operations applied so far, and transition relationships can be formulated based on the operation's effect on the number.

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the length of the resulting number when starting with a number of i digits and applying j operations.

For each pair (i, j), calculate dp[i][j] as follows:
- If j == 0, then dp[i][j] = i (since no operations have been applied)
- Otherwise, consider the last digit d of n. Replace it with decimal representation of integer d + 1. This changes the number of digits from i to ceil((i - 1) / 9) + 1.
- Recursively calculate dp[ceil((i - 1) / 9) + 1][j - 1]
- Add 1 for the new digit added
- Take modulo 10^9+7

Transition relationship: dp[i][j] = ceil((i - 1) / 9) + 1 + dp[ceil((i - 1) / 9) + 1][j - 1] mod 10^9+7

Start with base case where i == 0 or j == 0. Initialize the base cases and fill up the dp array accordingly.
Fill in the remaining cells of the dp array based on the transition relationship.

Return dp[i][m] as the answer for each test case, which represents the length of the resulting number after applying m operations starting with a number of i digits.
