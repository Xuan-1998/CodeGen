===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

State expression: Define the state as the decimal representation of the current number, and the base case is when the decimal representation has at most one digit (i.e., the number is less than 10).

Define a recursive function that takes the current number as input, applies the next operation, and returns the resulting length. The function will recursively call itself until it reaches the base case.

To improve the plan:

* Use a more efficient data structure to store the memoization results, such as a dictionary or a hashmap.
* Add a check to handle the edge cases where n is less than 10 (i.e., the number has at most one digit).
* Define the recursive function to take into account the modulo operation required in the problem statement.

Potential issues with the plan:

* The recursive function may cause a stack overflow for large values of m, as it will recursively call itself m times.
* The memoization approach may not be effective if the number of states is too large, as it will require storing and retrieving results from the memoization dictionary.
