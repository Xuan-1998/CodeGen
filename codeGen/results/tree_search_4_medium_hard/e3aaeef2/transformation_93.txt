===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a top-down approach with memoization, where the state is the current number and the base case is when there are no more operations.

The state expression could be dp[n] where dp[i] represents the length of number i after m operations.

dp(i) = 
    if m == 0:
        1
    else:
        min(
            dp(10j + (i//10^(len(i)-1-k))%10)
            for k from 0 to len(i)-1
        )

Employing a recursive function with memoization to build up the solution from smaller subproblems.

To avoid unnecessary calculations, we can use a bottom-up approach and initialize dp array with all values as infinity (or some large number).

We iterate over each digit of the number from left to right. For each digit, we calculate the result of the operation for that digit and update our answer accordingly.

Finally, we return the length of the resulting number modulo 10^9+7.
