===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

State expression: Define the state as the decimal representation of the current number, and the base case is when the decimal representation has no more than one digit.

Consider the state as the tuple (length, value) where length is the current number of digits in the decimal representation of the number, and value is the actual value of the number.

Dynamically create a 2D table where rows represent the states and columns represent the operations. Initialize each cell to -1, indicating that the result for this state and operation has not been computed yet.

For each row representing a state (length, value), iterate through each column representing an operation. For each operation, compute the new state by applying the operation to the current number.

The base case is when the length of the decimal representation of the current number is 1 or less. In this case, simply increment the length and value by 1 for each digit in the decimal representation that becomes greater than 9 after applying the operation.

For larger states, recursively compute the new state by applying the operation to the current number, and then update the result accordingly.

Finally, iterate through the table to find the resulting state (length, value) after applying m operations. Print the length of this state as the answer modulo 10^9+7.
