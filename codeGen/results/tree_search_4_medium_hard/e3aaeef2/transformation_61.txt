===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

The base case is dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since no digits are needed initially.

dp[i][j] represents the number of digits in the resulting number after applying j operations to an integer with i digits.

Use a bottom-up approach by iterating over all possible lengths and number of operations, filling up the dynamic programming table row by row.

For each cell dp[i][j], calculate the maximum possible length of the resulting number when applying j operations to an integer with i digits. This can be done by considering the worst-case scenario where every digit becomes 9 (since adding 1 to a digit results in the next smallest digit, and repeating this process will eventually reach the digit 9).

Since the maximum possible length is i + j, we have dp[i][j] = min(i + j, 18) (since the maximum number of digits that can be formed by replacing each digit with 9 is 18). 

This ensures that our dynamic programming table accurately captures all possible intermediate results.
