===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

State: Define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of digits required to represent the result after j operations on an i-digit number.

The state is defined as (n, m) where n is the current length of the number and m is the remaining number of operations. The transition relationship can be formulated as:

dp[n][m] = 1 + min(dp[n-1][m-1], ceil(log10(n)))

where the minimum is taken over all possible lengths n-1 that can be obtained from the current length n by applying one operation, and log10(n) represents the maximum number of digits that can be obtained after an operation.

Dynamically create a table based on the input values n and m, storing the lengths as you go along. 

If the initial number has more than 1 digit, perform a preprocessing step to calculate dp[0][j] for all j (since no operations are required for single-digit numbers).
