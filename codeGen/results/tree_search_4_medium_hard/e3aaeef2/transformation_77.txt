===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up approach with memoization and dynamic programming, where the state is the number of operations performed and the base case is when there are no more digits in the number.

The state expression could be dp[m][n] where dp[i][j] represents the length of the resulting number after i operations on an initial number of j digits.

dp[m][n] represents the length of the resulting number after m operations on an initial number of n digits, and the recurrence relation is:
if m > 0 and n > 0: 
    dp[m][n] = 1 + min(dp[i-1][j-1] for j in range(n) if n % 10 != 0)
else:
    dp[m][n] = 0

Applying memoization to the dynamic programming function by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary to avoid redundant computations.

The base case is when there are no more operations (m == 0), where the length of the resulting number is simply the initial number of digits n.
When m > 0, we apply each operation and recursively calculate the length of the resulting number after i-1 operations on an initial number of j-1 digits for all possible digits j in the current number.
