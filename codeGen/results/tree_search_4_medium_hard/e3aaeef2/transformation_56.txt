===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

State: Define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of digits required to represent the result after j operations on an i-digit number. Consider implementing a 2D array dp of size (10^9+7) x (2*10^5) to store the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

Transition relationship:
1. If m == 0, then dp[n][m] = n, since no more operations can be applied.
2. For m > 0:
    - Initialize a variable prev_length = 9 (assuming the maximum possible digit value is 9).
    - Iterate from i = 1 to n-1:
        * Calculate new_length = ceil(log10(prev_length + 1)) (since each operation increases the number by at least one digit).
        * Update dp[i][m] = min(dp[i][m], 1 + dp[new_length][m-1]) (considering all possible lengths that can be obtained from the current length by applying one operation).

Edge cases: 
- Handle n == 0, m > 0 separately, since no operations can be applied to a zero-length number.
- Consider handling edge cases for m = 0 and m = 1 separately.
