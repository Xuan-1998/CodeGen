===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

State: Define dp[i][j] as the minimum length of the resulting number when starting with a number of i digits and applying j operations. The state transition can be formulated based on the operation's effect on the number.

Transition relationships:
1. If j is 0, then dp[i][j] = i
2. If j > 0 and i is 1 (single digit), then dp[i][j] = 1
3. Otherwise, consider two cases:
    a. The last digit of the resulting number can be an even number (0-8). In this case, apply one more operation to it, so the transition becomes dp[i-1][j-1].
    b. The last digit of the resulting number is odd (1-9). In this case, add 1 to the last digit and proceed with the next operation.
4. Iterate over all possible values of i from 1 to n and j from 0 to m, considering each operation's effect on the number.

Return dp[n][m] as the result.
