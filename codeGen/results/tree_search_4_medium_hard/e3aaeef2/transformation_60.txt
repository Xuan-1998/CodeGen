===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] represents the number of digits in the resulting number after applying j operations to an integer with i digits.
The base case is dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since no digits are needed initially.
For each digit d from 1 to i:
    Calculate the length of the resulting number after applying one operation to an integer with d-1 digits: dp[d-1][k]
    Add 1 to the result (since the new digit will be added): dp[d-1][k] + 1
    Update dp[d][j]: 
        If j > k, use the previously calculated value dp[d][j-k]: dp[d][j] = dp[d-1][k]
        Else, update the value: dp[d][j] = dp[d-1][j]
Memoize the function that calculates the length of the resulting number for each operation, and use it to avoid redundant calculations.
