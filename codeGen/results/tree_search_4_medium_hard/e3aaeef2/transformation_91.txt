===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming, where the state is the current number and the base case is when there are no more operations.

The state expression could be dp[n] where dp[i] represents the length of number i after m operations.

dp(n) = 1 if m == 0, otherwise consider each digit d in n: 
    - Calculate the next number after applying one operation by replacing each digit with d + 1.
    - Recursively apply this process until there are no more operations left (m becomes 0).

Using a dynamic programming approach, iterate over the possible values of n and update the dp array accordingly.

dp(n) = min(dp(10j + (n//10^(len(n)-1-k))%10) for k from 0 to len(n)-1)

For edge cases, we need to consider when m becomes 0. This will be the base case where the function stops recursively calling itself and returns a value.

The plan should look something like this:

dp(0) = 0
for n from 1 to 10^9:
    if m == 0: 
        dp(n) = 1
    else:
        for k from 0 to len(n)-1:
            next_n = 0
            for digit in str(n):
                next_n = next_n * 10 + (int(digit) + 1)
            dp(n) = min(dp(next_n), dp(n))

The plan can be improved by considering the modulo operation more carefully. For example, if n has a lot of trailing zeros, we don't need to calculate all the powers of 10.

The potential issue with the plan is that it does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, what happens when m becomes 0? The base case should be handled separately.
