===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization.

dp(n, m) will represent the length of number n after applying m operations.

The state transition function could be f(n, k), where:
    - If k is 0, then dp(n, 0) = len(str(n)) (the length of number n)
    - If k > 0, then dp(n, k) = 1 + sum(dp(int(digit) + 1) for digit in str(n))

The memoization dictionary d will store the results of subproblems as we solve them.

dp(0, m) is not defined and it's unclear whether this should be handled separately.

To avoid repeating calculations, we can start by filling up the dp table from left to right (or bottom-up). This way, when we need to calculate dp(n, k), we have already calculated all the necessary subproblems.

This plan seems correct and well-structured. However, it's not entirely clear how to efficiently implement this memoization dictionary d.

Also, edge cases should be handled separately.
