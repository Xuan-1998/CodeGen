===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

State expression: Define the state as the decimal representation of the current number, with base case when the decimal representation has no more than one digit (i.e., 0 or 1).

State transition: Apply m operations by iterating through each digit d in the number, replacing it with the decimal representation of integer d + 1. For each operation, update the state and memoize the result.

Memoization table: Use a 2D array (table) where each cell represents the length of the decimal representation of the number after applying m operations for given n.

Edge cases:
- Handle initial case when n = 0 or m = 0.
- Handle edge cases for very large numbers and operations.
