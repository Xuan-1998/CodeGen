===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

State: Define dp[i][j] as the length of the resulting number when starting with a number of i digits and applying j operations. Use memoization to store and reuse these values.

Base Case:
- dp[1][0] = 1 (initially, the number has only one digit)

Recurrence Relation:
- For i > 1 and j >= 0, calculate dp[i][j] as follows:
    - If j == 0, return dp[i-1][0] (no operations applied)
    - Else, let d be the last digit of the current number. Calculate dp[i][j] by considering two cases: 
        - Case 1: The value of d + 1 is less than or equal to 9 (i.e., it fits in a single digit). In this case, replace d with its decimal representation and recursively calculate dp[i-1][j-1]. 
        - Case 2: The value of d + 1 is greater than 9. Then, the number of digits increases by 1. Calculate dp[i][j] as dp[i-1][j] (the last digit becomes the first digit of a new number).
    - Return the minimum of these two cases

Memoization:
- Store and reuse the calculated values in dp[][] to avoid redundant calculations.
