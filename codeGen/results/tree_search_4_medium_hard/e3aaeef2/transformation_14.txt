===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.
The state is defined by the length and value of the current number, considering all possibilities for the last digit. Base case is when n is a single digit.
You can represent the state as (n, last_digit) where n is the length of the current number and last_digit is the last digit of val after an operation is applied.
Then the transition relationship can be formulated based on whether last_digit + 1 has more or less digits than the previous last_digit.
Implement memoization using a dictionary to store the lengths of numbers after m operations, where keys are the states (n, last_digit) and values are the corresponding lengths.

Consider the base case when n is a single digit. In this case, the length of the number remains 1 regardless of the operation performed.

The transition relationship can be formulated as:
- If the last digit is less than 9, increment it by 1. This will result in a single-digit number.
- If the last digit is 9, set it to 0 and increment the length of the number.
- The new state would be (n + 1, 0) if the length was incremented.

Memoization can help to avoid redundant calculations and improve performance.

The plan does not include edge cases. It should consider handling n equal to 10^9 or m equal to 2 * 10^5.

To further improve the plan, consider using a dynamic programming table with dimensions (n, m) where each cell stores the length of the number after applying m operations.
