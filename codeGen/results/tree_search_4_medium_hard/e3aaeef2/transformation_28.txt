===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

State expression: Define the state as the decimal representation of the current number. Initialize an empty dictionary dp where dp[i][j] will store the length of the resulting number after i operations when the initial number has j digits.

Define a function update_state(n): Calculate the new length and value of the number after applying one operation to n, and return them as a tuple (length, value).

Iterate over all test cases:

    Read the initial number n and the number of operations m.
    Initialize dp[0][j] = j for all 1 ≤ j ≤ log10(n).
    For each operation i:
        Iterate over all possible lengths j of the current number from max(1, log10(n) - i) to min(log10(n), log10(m + n)):
            If j is in dp[i-1], update dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][dp[i-1][j][0]] + 1.
        Update dp[m][max(dp[0])].
    Print the length of the resulting number modulo 10^9+7.
