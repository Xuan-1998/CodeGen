===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

State: Define dp[i][j] as the maximum possible length of the resulting number when applying j operations on a number with i digits. This represents the state transition where we are considering a number with i digits, and after applying j operations, what would be the maximum possible length of the resulting number.

Transition Function: Calculate the next state dp[i+1][k] as the maximum possible length of the resulting number when applying k operations on a number with i+1 digits. This is done by considering all possible numbers with i+1 digits and applying k operations to each, then calculating the maximum possible length of the resulting number.

Initialization: Initialize dp[0][j] = 0 for all j (since there are no digits in an empty number), and dp[i][0] = i (since a number with i digits remains the same after 0 operations).

Base Case: Since we can't apply negative operations or more operations than the initial length of the number, set dp[i][j] to be equal to dp[i][i] for all i and j > i. This ensures that we don't consider any operations beyond what's possible given the initial length.

Main Algorithm:
For i from 1 to n (where n is the maximum possible number of digits):
    For j from 0 to m (where m is the number of operations):
        If j == 0, set dp[i][j] = i.
        Else:
            For each digit d in range(10):
                Calculate the next state transition: dp[i+1][k] = max(dp[i+1][k], d + 1).
            Set dp[i][j] to be the maximum possible length of the resulting number after applying j operations on a number with i digits.

Final Answer:
Return dp[n][m] as the length of the resulting number after applying m operations on a number with n digits, modulo 10^9+7.
