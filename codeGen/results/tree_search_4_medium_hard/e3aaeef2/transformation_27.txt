===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

State expression: Define the state as the decimal representation of the current number.

Base case: When the decimal representation has no more than one digit, consider it as the final state.
When the binary string has no more than one bit, consider it as the base case (just a single 0 or 1).

Use a dictionary to store the results for each operation and update it accordingly. The key would be the tuple of length and value, and the value would be the next state after applying the operation.

Update rule: For each operation, iterate over all digits in the current number, increment each digit by 1, and update the resulting decimal representation as the next state.
This can be done recursively or iteratively based on the problem constraints. The base case would trigger when the length of the resulting number is less than or equal to 1.

Edge cases: Ensure that the plan handles edge cases such as initial numbers with no digits (0) and operation count (m) being 0, in which case the final state would be the same as the initial state.
Also consider the case where m = length of the initial number, as all digits are incremented once by 1.
