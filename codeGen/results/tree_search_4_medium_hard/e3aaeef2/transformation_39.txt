dp[i][j] := (1 + j) if i = 0
else 
    dp[i][j] := min({dp[k][j-1] | k in range(1, i+1)}) + 1;
state: Define dp[i][j] as the length of the resulting number when starting with a number of i digits and applying j operations.
A combination of both (i, j) and (n, m) states can be used, with the latter being a more refined version of the former to better capture the dynamics.
