===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

The base case is dp[0][j] = 1 for all j, since there are no digits initially.

dp[i][j] represents the length of number i after applying j operations.

To calculate the value at dp[i][j], we need to consider two possibilities: 
- If the last digit of number i is even, then it remains unchanged after one operation. In this case, we can recursively calculate dp[(i // 10)][j - 1] and add 1 to account for the unchanged last digit.
- If the last digit of number i is odd, then it becomes even after one operation. In this case, we can recursively calculate dp[(i // 10)][j] without adding any extra digits.

The recurrence relation would be:
dp[i][j] = min(1 + dp[(i // 10)][j - 1], dp[(i // 10)][j])

We initialize the base cases as dp[0][j] = 1 for all j, and fill up the dynamic programming table from bottom to top.

Finally, we return dp[n][m] as the answer.
