===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a pair (len, val), where len is the length of the decimal representation of the current number and val is its value.

State expression: Define the base case as when the decimal representation has no more than one digit. Initialize an empty dictionary memo to store the results for each operation.

Consider the state as a vector representing the digits of the current number, and use memoization to store the results for each operation. Using a dynamic programming table with vectors as rows and columns, where dp[i][j] represents the length of the decimal representation after i operations on the number j.

dp[i][0] = 1 (base case), because one operation always results in a single-digit number.
For larger values j, consider the last digit d of j. If d > 5, then replacing it with d + 1 will result in a two-digit number, so dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][d*10 + (d+1)%10]. Otherwise, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j/10].

Edge cases: Handle the case when j has no more than one digit separately. If len <= 1, return the value of val modulo 10^9+7.
