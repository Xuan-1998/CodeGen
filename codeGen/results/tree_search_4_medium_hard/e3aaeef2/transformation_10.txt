===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

Let dp[i][j] represent the length of the resulting number after i operations when the initial value is j. 
The state is defined by the length and value of the current number, considering all possibilities for the last digit.
Base case: When n is a single digit, the state can be represented as (1, n).
State transitions:
For each operation, replace each digit d of the number with the decimal representation of integer d + 1.
The next state would be determined by applying the operation to each digit of val.
This process continues until no more operations are needed.

To improve the plan, consider using a map to store the results for each initial value and the length of the resulting number. This can help reduce the time complexity of calculating dp[i][j] when i is small.
Edge cases:
Handle edge case where n = 0 or m = 0 separately. In this case, return 1 as the length of the resulting number.
