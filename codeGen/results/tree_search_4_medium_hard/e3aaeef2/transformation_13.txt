===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

The state is defined by the length and value of the current number, considering all possibilities for the last digit. Base case is when n is a single digit.
You can represent the state as (n, last_digit) where n is the length of the current number and last_digit is the last digit of val after an operation is applied.

Then the transition relationship can be formulated based on whether last_digit + 1 has more or less digits than the previous last_digit. For example:

- If last_digit is even, then last_digit + 1 will always have one more digit.
- If last_digit is odd, then last_digit + 1 may either remain the same length (if it's a single-digit number) or increase by one digit.

Use memoization by creating a dynamic programming table dp of size 10^9 x 2, where each cell (n, i) stores the length of n after applying i operations. Initialize dp with base cases for single digit numbers and then fill up the rest of the table based on whether the last digit + 1 has more or less digits than the previous last_digit.
