===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming and memoization, where the state is the number of operations k and the base case is when k equals 0.
The state expression could be dp[k][n], where dp[k][i] represents the length of number i after k operations.
The idea is to iterate over all numbers from 1 to n and for each number calculate the length of the resulting number after m operations.
To do this, we can start from the base case where there are no more operations and then gradually add operations until we reach the maximum allowed number of operations.
We use a table dp[][] where dp[k][i] is the result for the number i and operations k.
