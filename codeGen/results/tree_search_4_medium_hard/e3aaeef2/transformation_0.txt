===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, using memoization to store results for each operation.

State expression: The current number's value after applying m operations, with base case being when m is 0. 

Initialize a dictionary dp with key-value pairs for (n, m), where dp[(n, m)] represents the result of applying m operations on number n. 

For state (n, m), calculate the result by considering the possible cases: 
- If m is 0, return the length of the current number.
- If m > 0, consider the last digit d of the current number and replace it with the decimal representation of integer d + 1. Recursively apply dp[(n // 10, m - 1)] to the rest of the number (n // 10).

Use a dictionary to store intermediate results for memoization.
