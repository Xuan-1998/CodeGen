===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] is defined as the length of the resulting number when starting with a number of i digits and applying j operations.

State: (n, m) where n is the initial number and m is the number of operations applied so far. 
Transition relationship can be formulated based on the operation's effect on the number. 

dp[i][j] = 1 if n % 10 == 0 else dp[ceil(log10(n))][m-1] + (n // 10).count(1)

Memoization is used with Python's built-in dictionary type to store and reuse previously computed results for faster computation.

Edge cases:
- For initial number n = 0, the length of resulting number is always 1.
- If m operations are applied on a single digit number (n < 10), then it will be replaced by another single digit number. So dp[1][m] = 1.

The plan seems correct and the implementation should work correctly for most test cases. However, in some cases where n is very large, ceil(log10(n)) might exceed Python's maximum recursion depth. In that case, you would need to implement a more efficient solution without using recursion.
