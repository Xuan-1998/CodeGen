===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

State expression: Consider the current number as a tuple of its value and whether it has been fully processed (processed or not), with base case being when m is 0. This can be represented as a dictionary where the key is the tuple of length and value, and the value is the result of applying the operations.

The state of the current number as a tuple of its value, with the increment operation applied to all digits, where each digit can be either the original value or incremented by 1. This can also be represented as a dictionary where the key is the tuple of length and value, and the value is the result of applying the operations.

Implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach using a 2D array or a nested loop to store the results.

For each operation, consider all possible next states that the number can transition to. This can include incrementing each digit by 1, as well as handling edge cases such as when the current digit is 9 and it becomes 10 after incrementing.
