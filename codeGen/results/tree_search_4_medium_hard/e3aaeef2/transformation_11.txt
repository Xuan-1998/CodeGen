===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

The state is defined by the length (n) and value (val) of the current number, considering all possibilities for the last digit. Base case is when n is a single digit.

You can consider the state as (n, val) where n is the length of the current number and val is its decimal value. The next state would be determined by applying the operation to each digit of val.

Create a memoization function that takes a tuple (n, val) and returns the result after applying m operations to val.

To apply the operation to each digit of val, iterate over each digit d in val:
    - Replace d with its successor (d + 1)
    - Recursively call the memoization function with the new state (n-1, new_val)

Base case: If n is a single digit, return val

Memoize the results for each operation using a dictionary dp where dp[(n, val)] = result

Initialize the result as the initial value of n
Apply m operations to n by recursively calling the memoization function with the updated state (n-1, new_val)

Return the result modulo 10^9+7
