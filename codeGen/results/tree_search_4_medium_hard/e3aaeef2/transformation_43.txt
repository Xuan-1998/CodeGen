===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

The base case is dp[0][j] = 1 for all j, since there are no digits initially.

dp[i][j] represents the length of number i after applying j operations

Memoize intermediate results using a dictionary to store the calculations for each length and number of operations, reducing computation time by avoiding redundant calculations.

For edge cases:
- Handle n=0: return 0
- Handle m=0: return the initial length of n
