===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.

State: Define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of digits required to represent the result after j operations on an i-digit number.

The state is defined as (n, m) where n is the current number of digits and m is the remaining number of operations. The transition relationship can be formulated as:
dp[n][m] = 1 + min(dp[k][m-1] for k in range(n+1)) if n > 0 else dp[0][m]

where the minimum is taken over all possible numbers of digits k that can be obtained from the current number n by applying one operation. If n is 0, it means we're starting with a single-digit number and there are m operations left to perform.

Tabulate a 2D array dp[n][m] with initial values dp[0][j] = 1 for all j, and fill up the table row by row based on the transition relationship.
