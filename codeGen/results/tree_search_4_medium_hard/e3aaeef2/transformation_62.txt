===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating the intermediate results for each length and number of operations.
The base case is dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since no digits are needed initially.

Let dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j-1] + ceil(log10(i)) - log10(k)) for k from 0 to i, where each operation adds a constant number of digits.
This is because in each operation, the number of digits increases by at most 1. 

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by filling the dp table from left to right and top to bottom.

For the final answer, use dp[n][m] and take the modulus with 10^9+7.
