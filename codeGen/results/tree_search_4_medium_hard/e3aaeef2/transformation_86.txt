===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a top-down approach with memoization, where the state is the current number and the base case is when there are no more operations.

Let dp[i][j] represent the length of the resulting number after i operations on numbers up to j. The state is the current number (n) and the operation count (m). The base case is when there are no more operations (dp[0][j] = 1, since the length of the resulting number in this case is always 1).

The transition from dp[i-1][j] to dp[i][j] involves calculating the length of the resulting number after i operations on numbers up to j. This can be done by considering all possible digits (0 to 9) and calculating the length of the resulting number if each digit is replaced with its successor.

Create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the length of the resulting number after i operations on numbers up to j.
For each operation, calculate the length of the resulting number by iterating through all possible digits (0 to 9) and calculating the length of the resulting number if each digit is replaced with its successor.

The final answer would be dp[m][n], which represents the length of the resulting number after m operations on numbers up to n.
