===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state of the current number as a tuple of its length and value, and use memoization to store the results for each operation.

State expression: Define the state as the decimal representation of the current number, and the base case is when the decimal representation has no more than one digit. The state represents the length of the number.

Memoization:
- Initialize a dictionary dp with default value -1
- For each possible state (length, value), compute the next state by applying the operation to the current state, then store the result in dp

Dynamic programming:
- Start from the base case (single-digit number)
- Compute the length of the resulting number after m operations for each state and store it in dp
- Iterate over all possible states and update the result with the minimum length that satisfies the condition

Dynamically build the sequence of operations based on the length of the current number:
- Initialize a variable res to -1
- For each operation, apply the operation to the current state and update res with the minimum length that satisfies the condition
- Return res modulo 10^9+7
