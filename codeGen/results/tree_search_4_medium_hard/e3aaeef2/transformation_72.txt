===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by tabulating intermediate results for each length and number of operations.
State: Define dp[i][j] as the maximum possible length of the resulting number when applying j operations on a number with i digits.
State: Define n_ as the initial number. Transition relationship:
    - For 0 ≤ k < m, if j = km and n has k digits,
        → Apply operation to each digit d to get (d + 1)_{k+1}...{(d+1)}_{10^(k-1)-1}(d+2).
Memoization can be used to avoid redundant calculations by storing intermediate results.
    - For i ≥ 0 and j ≥ 0, let dp[i][j] = max(1 + dp[⌊log10(n_ + j)⌋][k], k=0...m-1) (if n_ has ⌊log10(n_)⌋ digits)
    - Initialize dp[0][0] = 0, and for i ≥ 1, dp[i][0] = i.
Final Answer: For each test case, output the length of the resulting number modulo 10^9+7. This is equal to max(1 + dp[⌊log10(n_ + m)⌋][m], m=0...m-1). (if n has ⌊log10(n)⌋ digits)
