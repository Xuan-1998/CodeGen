===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up approach with memoization, where the state is the current number and the base case is when there are no more operations.

The state expression could be dp[n][m] where dp[i][j] represents the length of number i after j operations.

dp[n][0] = 1 (base case: no more operations)
dp[n][m] = sum(dp[(k*10 + n%10)][m-1] for k in range(9)) if m > 0
Use dynamic programming by initializing a 2D array dp of size (10^9+7, m+1) and filling it iteratively in row-major order.

dp[0][m] = 1 (base case: no more operations)

For edge cases:
- When n is 0, there are no digits to replace.
- When m is 0, there are no operations to apply.
