===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a top-down approach with memoization, where the state is the current number and the base case is when there are no more operations.

The state expression could be dp[n][m] where dp[i][j] represents the length of number i after j operations.

state: (n, m), transition relation: f((n, m)) = 
  if m > 0:
    let k = count_digits(n) - 1
    f(f(modulo(n, 10), m-1), k)
  else:
    return 1

The dynamic programming approach involves initializing a table dp where dp[i][j] represents the length of number i after j operations. The base case is when there are no more operations (i.e., m == 0).

For each cell in the table, you would iterate over each digit d of n and compute the length of the resulting number after applying the operation.

Initialization: dp[0][j] = 1 for all j

Transition relation:
dp[n][m] = 
  if m > 0:
    let k = count_digits(n) - 1
    f(f(modulo(n, 10), m-1), k)
  else:
    return 1

Base case: dp[i][0] = 1 for all i

Edge cases:
- n == 0, handle it separately

Return the value of dp[n][m]
