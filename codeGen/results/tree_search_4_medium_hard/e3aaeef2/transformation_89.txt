===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using bottom-up tabulation with a 2D array dp[n][m] where dp[i][j] represents the length of the resulting number after j operations on a number with i digits, considering all numbers from 1 to n.

The base case would be when there are no more operations (j=0), in which case the length of the resulting number is just the initial number's length.

To fill up the dp array, for each number with i digits and j operations left:
- Initialize the current number as a string.
- For each digit d of the current number:
  - Replace the digit with the decimal representation of integer d + 1 (dp[i-1][j-1] is used to avoid recomputation).
  - Update the current number.
- The length of the resulting number after j operations on this number with i digits is the length of the updated current number.

Finally, return dp[n][m] as the answer.
