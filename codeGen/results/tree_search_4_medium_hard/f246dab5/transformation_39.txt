===BEGIN PLAN===
A bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used where we fill up a 2D table in which each cell represents the minimum cost for a given timestamp, considering all possible ticket combinations from the start till now.

dp[i] might represent the minimum cost for a passenger to reach time t_i, considering all possible ticket combinations till now.

The state can be defined as (i, k), where i represents the current timestamp and k represents the number of 90-minute tickets used so far.

Applying memoization by storing the minimum cost for each timestamp and number of 90-minute tickets used in a dictionary.

To calculate dp[i][k], we consider all possible combinations of tickets that can be used till time t_i, considering the k 90-minute tickets already used. For each combination, we calculate the minimum cost by taking the minimum of the cost of using another ticket (one-trip or daily) and the cost of not using any new ticket.

We iterate from i = 0 to n-1, updating dp[i][k] for all k from 0 to min(i // 90, remaining_tickets).

Finally, we return dp[n-1][remaining_tickets - (n-1) % 3], which is the minimum cost for the passenger to reach time t_n.

The updated plan includes edge cases and handles the possibility of using more than one ticket per trip.
