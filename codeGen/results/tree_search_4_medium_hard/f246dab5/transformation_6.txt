===BEGIN PLAN===
DP can be solved by identifying that we need to find the minimum cost for a given time stamp, considering all possible ticket combinations from the start till now. This subproblem will have overlapping instances as we move forward in time.

The state is a tuple of (minutes_left_until_ticket_expires, total_cost_so_far): This choice captures both the information about when the ticket expires and the cumulative cost of all previously used tickets.

State: (time_left_until_ticket_expires, cost_of_last_ticket)
Transition relationship: Calculate the minimum cost for each trip considering all possible ticket combinations from the start till now. Update state by updating time_left_until_ticket_expires and cost_of_last_ticket accordingly.

Create a 3D array to store the dynamic programming states, with dimensions (max_time_left + 1) x (max_cost + 1) x 3 (for the three types of tickets), where max_time_left is the maximum time left until a ticket expires and max_cost is the maximum possible cost. The extra dimension is for storing the costs of the last ticket used.

Initialize the array with infinity values, except for the base case where minutes_left_until_ticket_expires == 0 and total_cost_so_far == 0, which should be initialized to the cost of the one-minute ticket.

For each trip, calculate the minimum cost by considering all possible ticket combinations from the start till now. Update the state accordingly.
