===BEGIN PLAN===
A bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used where we fill up a 2D table in which each cell represents the minimum cost for a given timestamp, considering all possible ticket combinations from the start till now.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] representing the minimum cost for a passenger to reach time t_i using j 90-minute tickets.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum cost for a passenger to reach time t_i using j 1-trip tickets, considering all possible ticket combinations from the start till now.

Initialize the table with base cases: dp[0][0] = 0 (no trips and no tickets) and dp[i][0] = 20 * i (using only one-trip tickets for each trip).

Fill up the table row by row:

* For each time t_i, calculate the minimum cost for using j 90-minute tickets: dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j-1] + 50) for k from 0 to i
* Calculate the minimum cost for using j 1-trip tickets: dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j-1] + 20) for k from 0 to i

Memoize the function to calculate the minimum cost for each ticket combination, considering all possible ticket combinations from the start till now.

Finally, return the last cell of the table: dp[n-1][j]
