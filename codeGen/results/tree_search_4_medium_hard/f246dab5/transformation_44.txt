===BEGIN PLAN===
A bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used where we fill up a 2D table in which each cell represents the minimum cost for a given timestamp, considering all possible ticket combinations from the start till now.

Let dp[i] represent the minimum cost for a passenger to reach time t_i, considering all possible ticket combinations till now. We initialize dp[0] = 0 as there are no trips made yet.

The transition can be defined as:
- If the current trip uses a one-trip ticket: min(dp[j - 1] + 20, dp[j])
- If the current trip uses a 90-minute ticket: min(dp[j - 90] + 50, dp[j])
- If the current trip uses a day ticket: min(dp[j - 1440] + 120, dp[j])

Using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation by creating a 2D table to store the minimum cost for each timestamp, considering all possible ticket combinations till now.

We iterate through each trip from start to end. For each trip, we update dp[i] based on the optimal choice of tickets.
Finally, we return dp[n - 1] as it represents the minimum cost for a passenger to reach time t_n.
