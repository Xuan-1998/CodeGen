A bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used where we fill up a 2D table in which each cell represents the minimum cost for a given timestamp, considering all possible ticket combinations from the start till now.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] representing the minimum cost for a passenger to reach time t_i using j 90-minute tickets.
dp[i][k] would represent the minimum cost for a passenger to reach time t_i using k 1-trip tickets, considering all possible ticket combinations from the start till now.

The transition function could be dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][m] + 50*j, dp[i-1][n-1] + (i - t_m) for m from 0 to j and n-1 from 0 to i-t_m), where the minimum cost is calculated by considering all possible combinations of tickets used up to time t_i.
The base case could be dp[0][j] = 50*j, which represents the minimum cost if no trips have been made yet.

Tabulate and use three nested loops to fill up the table, where the outer loop iterates over each trip time t_i, the middle loop iterates over each possible number of tickets used for that trip (from 0 to j), and the innermost loop iterates over all previous timestamps to determine which ticket combinations can be used.

Finally, we iterate over each trip time t_i and print out dp[i][j] as the minimum cost charged after the i-th trip.
