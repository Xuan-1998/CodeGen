===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization can be used with dynamic programming where we keep track of previously computed values and avoid redundant computation.

dp[i] represents the minimum cost for i-th trip.
dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + (50 if t_i > 90 else 20)) for i, t_i in enumerate(range(n))
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by filling up the dp array in order from left to right, where each entry depends only on previous ones.

We can further optimize the plan by initializing dp[0] and dp[1] with base cases. Since there is no ticket used for the first trip, dp[0] should be 20. For the second trip, we need one of either the single-trip or 90-minute tickets. So, dp[1] can be calculated as min(20, 50).

Finally, initialize a variable to store the total cost and iterate over the range from 2 to n (inclusive) to calculate the minimum cost for each trip. In each iteration, use the previously computed dp[i-1] and dp[i-2] values to update dp[i].

This plan includes edge cases by considering the base cases of dp[0] and dp[1]. It also avoids redundant computation using dynamic programming.
