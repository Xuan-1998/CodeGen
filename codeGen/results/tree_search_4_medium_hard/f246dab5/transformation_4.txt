===BEGIN PLAN===
DP can be solved by identifying that we need to find the minimum cost for a given time stamp, considering all possible ticket combinations from the start till now. This subproblem will have overlapping instances as we move forward in time.

The state is a tuple of (minutes_left_until_ticket_expires, total_cost_so_far): This choice captures both the information about when the ticket expires and the cumulative cost of all previously used tickets.
State: (minutes, tickets_used);
Transition relationship: For each possible ticket, calculate the minimum cost that can be achieved using this ticket and the remaining trips. Update state by taking the minimum cost and updating the number of tickets used.

Initialize a dictionary to store the memoized values with an initial value for the base case (0 minutes left until ticket expires).
Recursively traverse through the problem space and update the memoized values.
For each possible trip, calculate the cost using the current minimum cost and the cost of the previous trips. Update the state accordingly.

The plan is correct, but it can be improved by considering edge cases. For example, when there are no more tickets left, the function should return the total cost so far.
