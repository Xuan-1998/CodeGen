===BEGIN PLAN===
A bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used where we fill up a 2D table in which each cell represents the minimum cost for a given timestamp, considering all possible ticket combinations from the start till now.

A state could be defined as dp[i] = min_cost_till_ti, where min_cost_till_ti is the minimum cost for the passenger to reach time t_i.

Consider a 2D array dp[][] where dp[i][j] represents the minimum cost up to timestamp i after using j tickets.

We can fill up this table row by row. For each row i and column j:
- If we haven't used any ticket yet (i.e., j = 0), then the minimum cost is just the cost for the current trip.
- Otherwise, consider all possible combinations of tickets that can be used to reach time t_i with at most j tickets. 
  - For each combination, calculate its cost by summing up the costs of individual trips. 
  - The minimum cost will be the minimum of these costs.

Memoization can be achieved using a function that takes the current timestamp and the number of tickets used as arguments. This function would return the minimum cost after using these many tickets at this timestamp.

This plan covers all the possible scenarios for each trip, considering the optimal ticket combinations to minimize the total cost.
