===BEGIN PLAN===
A bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used where we fill up a 2D table in which each cell represents the minimum cost for a given timestamp, considering all possible ticket combinations from the start till now.

dp[i] might represent the minimum cost for a passenger to reach time t_i, considering all possible ticket combinations till now.
Let s represent the minimum cost for a passenger to reach time t_i, considering all possible ticket combinations till now. The transition can be defined as min(s(t_j - 1) + 20, s(t_j)) if the current trip is using a one-trip ticket, or min(s(t_j - 90) + 50, s(t_j)) if it's using a 90-minute ticket.

To improve the plan, we can sort the trips by timestamp (t_i) to reduce the number of unnecessary calculations.
We should also add edge cases for when there are no previous trips and when the first trip is considered. In this case, the initial value would be the cost of one-trip tickets for each minute until the start of the first trip.
