===BEGIN PLAN===
A bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used where we fill up a 2D table in which each cell represents the minimum cost for a given timestamp, considering all possible ticket combinations from the start till now.

dp[i][num_tickets] might represent the minimum cost for a passenger to reach time t_i, considering all possible ticket combinations till now. The dp state can be defined as:

- If num_tickets < 2: dp[i][num_tickets] = dp[i - 1][0] + 20 (since we need at least one ticket)
- If num_tickets >= 2 and i - num_tickets * 90 <= t_i: dp[i][num_tickets] = dp[i - num_tickets * 90][num_tickets - 1] + 50
- If num_tickets >= 2 and i - num_tickets * 90 > t_i: dp[i][num_tickets] = dp[i - 1][0] + 20
- If num_tickets == 0 or i < 14 * 60: dp[i][num_tickets] = dp[i - 1][num_tickets] + 20

Memoize the function calculating the fare for each trip, using the current timestamp and the number of used tickets as memoization keys.
