A bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used where we fill up a 2D table in which each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum cost for a given timestamp t_i, considering all possible ticket combinations from the start till now.

The state expression could be dp[i][0] representing the minimum cost for a passenger to reach time t_i using no 90-minute tickets. This would be equal to the sum of the fares for each trip up until time t_i.
dp[i][j] represents the minimum cost for a passenger to reach time t_i using j 90-minute tickets, considering all possible ticket combinations from the start till now.

Fill up the 2D table in bottom-up manner. For each cell dp[i][j], consider two possibilities:
1. The current trip does not require any new ticket: In this case, the cost for the current trip will be added to the minimum cost of previous trips.
2. The current trip requires a new 90-minute ticket: In this case, the cost for the current trip and the additional cost of the new ticket will be added to the minimum cost of previous trips.

The final answer would be dp[n-1][0], which represents the minimum cost for all trips using no 90-minute tickets.
