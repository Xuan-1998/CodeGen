A bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used where we fill up a 2D table in which each cell represents the minimum cost for a given timestamp, considering all possible ticket combinations from the start till now.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] representing the minimum cost for a passenger to reach time t_i using j 90-minute tickets.

The state is dp[t][k] where k is the number of 1-day tickets and t is the current timestamp. The transition relationship is based on deciding whether to use a 1-day ticket or a 90-minute ticket to reach time t.

Use a 1D array dp of size 10^9 + 5, and consider dp[t] as the minimum cost for a passenger to reach time t.

Initially, set all dp values to infinity. Then iterate over all trips from start to end, updating dp values based on whether using a 1-day ticket or a 90-minute ticket is more economical. For each trip, use the updated dp value and calculate the fare charged after that trip.

The plan seems correct in terms of its approach. However, it might be improved by considering the time complexity of the problem. The given constraints suggest that the total number of trips will not exceed 10^5. This implies that we can use a simple iteration over all trips instead of using dynamic programming directly on the timestamp.

The plan does consider edge cases such as initializing dp values to infinity and handling the first trip separately.
