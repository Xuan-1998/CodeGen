===BEGIN PLAN===
A bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used where we fill up a 2D table in which each cell represents the minimum cost for a given timestamp, considering all possible ticket combinations from the start till now. 
We can use a 1D array dp of size n+1 where dp[i] = min_cost_till_ti, where min_cost_till_ti is the minimum cost for the passenger to reach time t_i.
The state transition equation can be defined as:
dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + 20, dp[max(0, i-90)] + 50, dp[max(0, i-1440)] + 120)
This ensures that we consider all possible ticket combinations from the start till now.
The base case for the recurrence can be set as dp[0] = 0 since there is no cost initially.
