===BEGIN PLAN===
DP can be solved by identifying that we need to find the minimum cost for a given time stamp, considering all possible ticket combinations from the start till now. This subproblem will have overlapping instances as we move forward in time.

The state is a tuple of (minutes_left_until_ticket_expires, total_cost_so_far): 
This choice captures both the information about when the ticket expires and the cumulative cost of all previously used tickets.

State: (minutes, total_cost); 
Transition relationship: For each possible ticket, calculate the minimum cost that can be achieved using this ticket and the remaining trips. Update state by taking the minimum cost and updating the total cost.
Use a 2D array to store the cumulative minimum cost for each possible pair of (minutes_left_until_ticket_expires, total_cost) and use dynamic programming to fill up the array.

For the first row in the array, set the value as the cost of the ticket that expires at the current time. This is because the only possible choice is the single-use ticket.
Then iterate over each cell in the array:
1. Calculate the minimum cost using the tickets that expire before the current minute (previous row).
2. For each possible ticket that expires after the current minute, calculate the minimum cost by adding the cost of the ticket to the minimum cost of the previous minute when this ticket expires.
3. Take the minimum cost from all options and update the state.

This plan seems correct for solving the problem.
The edge cases are handled by setting the initial values in the array correctly and handling the base case where only one option exists.
There is no potential issue identified with the plan, but it may be improved by using a more efficient data structure or algorithm.
