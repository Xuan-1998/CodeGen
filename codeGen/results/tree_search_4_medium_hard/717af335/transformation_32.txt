===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression seems like it would involve finding the minimum value for X that satisfies the given conditions. The transition relationships might involve recursively calling the function with smaller values of A and B, or maybe even using some kind of iterative approach.

Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = min(X) such that A-i = X + j and B-j = X ^ j, where i is the current value of A and j is the current value of B.

dp[i][j] could be formulated as dp[i][j] = X where A-i = X and B-j = X ^ (i-j), then find the minimum value of X

Use a 2D array to store the minimum values of X for each possible combination of A and B, where dp[A][B] would hold the minimum value of X that satisfies the given conditions.

To make it more efficient, we can first check if i is less than j. If true, then we know that X must be at least (A-i)/2 + 1 because any smaller X would result in a larger sum for A-i. We can skip all combinations where X is less than this minimum value.

Initialize the dp array with infinity values. Then iterate over all possible combinations of i and j, updating the dp array accordingly.

Finally, return dp[A][B] as the minimum value of X that satisfies the given conditions.
