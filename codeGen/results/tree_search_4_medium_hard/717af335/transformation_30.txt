===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression seems like it would involve finding the minimum value for X that satisfies the given conditions. The transition relationships might involve recursively calling the function with smaller values of A and B, or maybe even using some kind of iterative approach.

Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = min(X) such that A-i = X + j and B-j = X ^ j, where i is the current value of A and j is the current value of B. This would help us keep track of the minimum value of X for each possible combination of A and B.

dp[i][j] could be formulated as:
if i <= 0 or j <= 0:
    return float('inf') if i > 0 else 0
else:
    dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][l] + 1) for k in range(i, j+1) and l in range(j, -1, -1)

The base case for the recursive function would be when i or j becomes zero. In this case, we return infinity if i is greater than zero (to handle cases where A is larger than B), otherwise we return 0.

The transition relationship involves finding the minimum value of X that satisfies the given conditions for each possible combination of A and B.
