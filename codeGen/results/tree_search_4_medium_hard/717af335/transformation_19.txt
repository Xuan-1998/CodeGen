===BEGIN PLAN===
The base case could be when A or B is 0, in which case X would just be the other value.

State: (A, B), and the state space can be represented by dp[(i, j)] where i = 0 to A, j = 0 to min(A, B).

dp[(i, j)] represents whether there exists a solution for i and j. Start with dynamic programming and fill up the dp array row by row.

Base case: If either i or j is 0, then dp[i][j] should be True, because X can simply be the other value (A or B).

Recursive relation:
1. If i == A and j == min(A, B), dp[(i, j)] = True
2. Otherwise, dp[(i, j)] = dp[(i - 1, j - 1)] || dp[(i - 1, j + 1)]

Top-down approach: Start from the top-right corner of the dp array and fill it up row by row.
Bottom-up approach: Start from the bottom-left corner of the dp array and fill it up column by column.
