===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression seems like it would involve finding the minimum value for X that satisfies the given conditions. The transition relationships might involve recursively calling the function with smaller values of A and B.

Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = min(X) such that A-i = X + j and B-j = X ^ (i-j), where i is the current value of A and j is the current value of B. This can be rewritten as dp[A][B] = min(X) such that A-X = X + (B-^X).

Create a dictionary to store the results, where keys are tuples (A, B) and values are the corresponding minimum X values.

Create an iterative approach by iterating over all possible values of X from 0 to min(A, B), and for each value of X, calculate A-X and B-^X. If A-X = X + (B-^X), then update dp[A][B] with the current value of X.

The plan does not include edge cases, so it should be modified to handle them. For example, if A or B is 0, then X must be equal to A or B respectively, and dp[A][B] can be updated accordingly.
