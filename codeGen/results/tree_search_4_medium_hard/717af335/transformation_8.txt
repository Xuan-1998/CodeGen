===BEGIN PLAN===
Let's start by defining the recursive function to find the minimum value of X that satisfies the conditions A = X + Y and B = X ^ Y.

We'll use memoization to store the results and avoid recomputation. This will help us solve the problem efficiently.

Next, we'll model the problem as a graph where nodes are pairs (X, Y) satisfying the conditions A = X + Y and B = X ^ Y. Define an edge between two nodes if they differ by 1 in either X or Y.

We can use DFS or BFS to traverse the graph and find the minimum value of X that satisfies the conditions. If the graph is connected, then our algorithm will terminate when we reach the target node (i.e., the pair (X, Y) that satisfies A = X + Y and B = X ^ Y).

To handle edge cases, we should check for special cases like when A = 0 or B = 0.
