Define states as tuples (A, B) and values as the minimum value of X that satisfies A = X + Y and B = X ^ Y for each state.

Create a memo dictionary to store the results of subproblems. Initialize it with default value -1.

For each possible value of X from 0 to A:
    Calculate Y using A - X.
    Check if the current state (A, B) is in the memo dictionary. If not, calculate the minimum value of X for this state and store it in the memo dictionary.
Return the result for the given state (A, B) from the memo dictionary.

This plan handles edge cases correctly because it iterates over all possible values of X up to A, ensuring that the smallest possible value of X is found.
