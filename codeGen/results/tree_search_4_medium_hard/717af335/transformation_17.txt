===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to find the smallest possible value of X, it seems like a top-down approach might be more suitable. We could start by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems where we're given values for A and B that are closer to the solution, and then use memoization to store the results so we don't have to recompute them.

Define the state expression as dp[A][B] = min(X) such that A = X + Y and B = X xor Y. The base case is when A = 0 or B = 0, in which case the smallest possible value of X is either 0 or A/2 respectively.

For the recursive case, consider a subproblem where A' = A - X and B' = B - X. We know that X xor Y = A + B - 2X, so we can rewrite this as X xor (A' + B') = A' + B'. This means that X is equal to the bitwise XOR of two numbers, one being A' and the other being B' - X.

We can use this relationship to reduce the problem size by considering smaller subproblems. We maintain a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the smallest possible value of X when A = i and B = j. The recurrence relation is: dp[A][B] = min(X) such that X + Y = A and X xor Y = B.

The final solution would be dp[A][B]. To avoid re-computing the same subproblems multiple times, we can use memoization to store the results of the subproblems as we solve them.
