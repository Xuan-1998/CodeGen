===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to find the smallest possible value of X, it seems like a top-down approach might be more suitable. We could start by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems where we're given values for A and B that are closer to the solution, and then use memoization to store the results so we don't have to recompute them.

Define the state expression as X = min((A + B) / 2, (B - 1) xor (A - 1)), where the base case is when A = 0 or B = 0. This can be done using a recursive approach with memoization.

X could represent the sum of two numbers, where one number is A - X and the other is B xor (A - X). This relationship can be used to reduce the problem size by considering smaller subproblems.

Consider using a memoized function with a recursive approach, where the base case is when A = 0 or B = 0. This would allow you to store and reuse previously computed values of X.

To handle edge cases, consider adding additional conditions for when A or B equals 1. These special cases can be solved independently without affecting the main algorithm.
