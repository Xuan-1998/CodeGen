===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with memoization.

We define the state expression as X + Y = A, and use a recursive function to find the minimum value of X that satisfies this condition.

Let's define states for each possible value of X from 0 to A, then compute Y for each X using A - X.

We implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary to store intermediate results. The function takes two parameters: A and B.

The base case is when A = 0, in which case we return B as the minimum value of X that satisfies the condition.

For other values of A, we iterate from X = 0 to A, and for each X, compute Y using A - X. Then we check if there exists a Y such that B = X xor Y. If so, we update the memoization dictionary with the result and recursively call the function for A - X and B.

The final result is the minimum value of X that satisfies the condition, which can be obtained by looking up in the memoization dictionary.
