===BEGIN PLAN===
We can solve this problem using Dynamic Programming with a bottom-up approach. Define states for each possible value of X from 0 to A, then compute Y for each X using A - X.

Initialize an array dp where dp[i] represents the minimum value of X that satisfies X + (A - X) = A and X ^ (A - X) = B when X is equal to i. Initialize dp[0] to be 0 because the smallest possible value of X is 0.

Iterate over all possible values of X from 1 to A, updating the minimum value as you go. For each X, compute Y using A - X and check if X + Y = A and X ^ Y = B. If this condition is met, update dp[X] with the minimum value between its current value and X.

Return dp[A] as the minimum value of X that satisfies the conditions.

This plan does not include edge cases but can be easily modified to handle them by checking for specific conditions at the beginning of the algorithm.
