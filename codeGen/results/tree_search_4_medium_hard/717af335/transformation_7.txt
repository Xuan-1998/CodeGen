===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to find the smallest possible value of X, it seems like a bottom-up approach might be more suitable. We could start by iterating from 0 and check if A - i satisfies the condition B = (A - i) ^ Y for some non-negative integer Y.
Define the state expression as X + Y = A, and use dynamic programming to find the minimum value of X that satisfies this condition.
Model the problem as a table where rows are possible values of X and columns are possible values of Y. Fill in the table by iterating from 0 to A, and for each X, check if there exists some non-negative integer Y such that X + Y = A and B = X ^ Y.
Employ dynamic programming using iteration with memorization, solving subproblems only once and storing their results to avoid redundant computation
For edge cases, handle the case when A is even and B is 0 by setting X = 0, Y = A.
