===BEGIN PLAN===
The base case could be when A or B is 0, in which case X would just be the other value. We can use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach by filling a 2D table where each cell represents whether there exists an X and Y that satisfy A = X + Y and B = X ^ Y for given A and B values.

The state is (A, B), and the base case is when either A or B is 0. In this case, we can set X to be the other value directly.

Transition relationship: For each i from 1 to A and j from 1 to min(A, B), consider the following cases:
- If dp[i-1][j] is true, then consider X = i-1 and Y = j-(i-1) as a solution.
- If dp[i-1][j-1] is true, then consider X = i-1 and Y = j-i as a solution.
- If neither of the above cases works out, then set dp[i][j] to false.

The final answer would be the minimum X such that dp[A][B] is true.
