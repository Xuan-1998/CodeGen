===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to find the smallest possible value of X, it seems like a top-down approach might be more suitable. We could start by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems where we're given values for A and B that are closer to the solution, and then use memoization to store the results so we don't have to recompute them.

Define the state expression as A - B = 2 * X, and base case is when X = 0. This will help us to calculate all possible combinations of X and Y.

Think about the fact that XOR is an odd function. This means that if A or B (or both) is even, then the result of the XOR operation will be odd, and vice versa.

You can implement dynamic programming by defining a function findX(A, B) that takes A and B as inputs and returns the smallest possible value of X that satisfies the conditions. Then, use a table dp where dp[i][j] represents the smallest possible value of X when A = i and B = j, and fill up the table in a bottom-up manner using the recurrence relation dp[i][k] = min(dp[i-1][k-1] + k - i, dp[i-k][j]) for all i from 1 to A and j from 0 to B.

Since we're dealing with non-negative integers, we need to handle edge cases where either A or B (or both) is zero. In that case, the smallest possible value of X would be zero as well.
