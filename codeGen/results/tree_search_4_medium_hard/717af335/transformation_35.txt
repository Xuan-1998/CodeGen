===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression seems like it would involve finding the minimum value for X that satisfies the given conditions. The transition relationships might involve recursively calling the function with smaller values of A and B, or maybe even using some kind of iterative approach.

Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = min(Y) such that A-i = X + Y and B-j = X ^ Y, where i is the current value of A and j is the current value of B.

For each valid pair (i, j), dp[i][j] is updated as follows:
  - If there exists a Y such that A-i = X+Y and B-j = X^Y, then update dp[i][j] with this Y. Otherwise, set it to -1.
  - The base case is when i=0 or j=0, in which case we can immediately return the answer.

The main idea is to iterate over all possible values of (i, j) and for each valid pair, calculate the minimum value of X that satisfies A-i = X+Y and B-j = X^Y.

To improve this plan:
  - Add edge cases: Check if i > A or j > B before proceeding. If so, return an error.
  - Update dp[i][j] in a way that takes into account the minimum value of Y for each valid pair (i, j).
  - Use memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computation.

The plan does not explicitly consider edge cases, which should be handled separately. The updated version of the plan is:
