===BEGIN PLAN===
The base case could be when A or B is 0, in which case X would just be the other value.
We can also consider using a combination of both top-down and bottom-up approaches if needed.

The state is (A, B), and the base case is when either A or B is 0.

State: (X, Y) where X = 0 to A, Y = 0 to min(A, B), dp[(i, j)] represents whether there exists a solution for i and j.
Use memoization to store the results of subproblems as you solve them, and then iterate over all possible values for X and Y.

Iterate from (0, 0) to (A, B), and for each pair (i, j):
    If A = i + j and B = i ^ j:
        Find the smallest possible value of X that satisfies these conditions
    Else:
        Return -1

This plan seems correct but can be improved by using bitwise operations instead of calculating the sum and XOR separately. Also, we don't need to iterate over all possible values for X and Y as we can just update X and Y accordingly.

The edge cases are covered in this plan, such as when A or B is 0.
