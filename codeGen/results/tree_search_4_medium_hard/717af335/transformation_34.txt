===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = min(X) such that A-i = X + j and B-j = X ^ j, where i is the current value of A and j is the current value of B.
dp[i][j] could be formulated as dp[i][j] = X where A-i = X and B-j = X ^ (i-j), then find the minimum value of X

State transition: 
- If j == 0, then X = A - i
- If i < j, then there is no possible solution for X and Y, so return -1
- Otherwise, recursively call dp[i-j][j] to get the smallest value of X that satisfies B-j = X ^ (i-j), then update the result as min(X) + j

Employ a recursive function with memoization to store the results of sub-problems

State initialization: 
- Initialize dp[0][0] = 0, since there is no possible solution for i = 0 and j = 0

Memoization: 
- Store the results of sub-problems in a 2D array dp[][]

Main function:
- Calculate the smallest value of X that satisfies A = X + Y and B = X ^ Y by calling dp[A][B]
- If there is no possible solution, return -1
- Otherwise, calculate Y as A - X and print the result
