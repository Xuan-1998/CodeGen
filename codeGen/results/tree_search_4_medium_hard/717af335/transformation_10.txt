===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming and memoization.

We define the state expression as A - B = 2 * X, which represents the relationship between A, B, and X. The base case is when X = 0, where A = B.

Next, we consider the parity of A and B in terms of their evenness or oddness. If both are even, we can find a solution for X and Y.

We create a memoization table dp, where dp[i] represents the smallest possible value of X that satisfies the conditions when A = i and B = 0. We start with dp[0] = 0, since there is no solution when A = 0.

We iterate over all possible values of A from 1 to N (where N is the maximum possible value of A). For each value of A, we find the smallest possible value of X that satisfies the conditions by iterating over all possible values of B from 0 to A. We use memoization to store and look up the results as we solve the subproblems.

Finally, we return dp[A] as the result.
