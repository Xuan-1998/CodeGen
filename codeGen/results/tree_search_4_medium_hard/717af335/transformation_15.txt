===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to find the smallest possible value of X, it seems like a top-down approach might be more suitable.

We could start by checking for edge cases. For instance, if both A and B are 1, then X = 0 is the solution. If one of them is 0, then X is either 0 or the other number.

Next, we can break down the problem into smaller subproblems where we're given values for A and B that are closer to the solution. We can use memoization to store the results so we don't have to recompute them.

Define the state expression as follows: Iterate over possible values of X from 0 to min(A, B), and for each value, check if it satisfies the condition A = X + Y and B = X ^ Y. If not, move on to the next value.

Think about implementing dynamic programming by using a loop that starts at the smallest possible value of X (which is 0) and ends at min(A, B). For each iteration, calculate Y as A - X and check if it satisfies the condition B = X ^ Y. If not, move on to the next iteration.
