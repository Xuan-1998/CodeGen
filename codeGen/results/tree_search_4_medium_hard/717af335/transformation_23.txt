===BEGIN PLAN===
The base case could be when A or B is 0, in which case X would just be the other value.
We consider using a bottom-up approach and a dictionary to store intermediate results for memoization.

State: (A, B)
Base case: When either A or B is 0

Transition relationship:
For each i from 1 to A+1 and j from 0 to min(A, B), 
if there's no solution for i-1 and j, then consider X = i and Y = j-i as the solution.
Store (A, B) -> (X, Y) in the dictionary if a solution is found.

Memoization:
Recursively solve the problem and store intermediate results in a dictionary to avoid redundant computations.

Edge cases:
Handle A=0 or B=0 separately, returning (0, B) or (A, 0) respectively.
