===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression seems like it would involve finding the minimum value for X that satisfies the given conditions. The transition relationships might involve recursively calling the function with smaller values of A and B, or maybe even using some kind of iterative approach.

Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = min(X) such that A-i = X + j and B-j = X ^ j, where i is the current value of A and j is the current value of B.
dp[i][j] could be formulated as dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][l] + 1) for k <= i-l and l <= j, with some constraints on k and l

Let's first handle the base cases:
dp[A+1][B+1] = float('inf'); for x in range(A+1): dp[x][0] = x; for y in range(B+1): dp[0][y] = y
Now, we can fill up the dp table in a bottom-up manner.
For each i from A to 0 and j from B to 0:
    if i >= j: 
        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-j][j-1], i) + 1;
    else:
        dp[i][j] = float('inf');
