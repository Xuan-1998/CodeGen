===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to find the smallest possible value of X, it seems like a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming might be more suitable. We could start by initializing a 2D table dp[A+1][B+1] where dp[i][j] represents the smallest possible value of X for given values A and B.

Model the problem as a graph where nodes are pairs (X, Y) satisfying the conditions A = X + Y and B = X ^ Y. Define an edge between two nodes if they differ by 1 in either X or Y.

Use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming to fill up the table dp[i][j]. Initialize dp[0][0] as 0, since X = 0 satisfies the conditions.

For each cell dp[i][j], consider all possible values of X and Y that satisfy A = X + Y and B = X ^ Y. Since we want the smallest possible value of X, update dp[i][j] with the minimum value among these possibilities.

Finally, return dp[A+1][B+1] as the smallest possible value of X that satisfies the conditions.
