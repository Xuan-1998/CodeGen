===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression seems like it would involve finding the minimum value for X that satisfies the given conditions. The transition relationships might involve recursively calling the function with smaller values of A and B, or maybe even using some kind of iterative approach.

Define the state expression as dp[A][B] = min(X) such that A = X + Y and B = X ^ Y. Then we can use dynamic programming to fill up a 2D array where each cell [i][j] represents the minimum value for X that satisfies these conditions when A = i and B = j.

The transition relationships would be:
dp[i][j] = min(X) such that A-i = X + Y and B-j = X ^ Y, where i is the current value of A and j is the current value of B.

To solve this problem we can use a 2D array to store these minimum values. Start by initializing dp[0][0] = 0 because when A = 0 and B = 0, any value for X will satisfy these conditions.

Then iterate over each cell in the array from top-right corner (A,B) downwards:
- if A-i >= i and B-j == i ^ j, then update dp[i][j] with min(dp[A-i][B-j], i)
- else, dp[i][j] = -1 because there is no possible value for X that satisfies these conditions

Finally, return dp[A][B] as the minimum value for X that satisfies these conditions.
