===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression seems like it would involve finding the minimum value for X that satisfies the given conditions. The transition relationships might involve recursively calling the function with smaller values of A and B, or maybe even using some kind of iterative approach.

Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = min(X) such that i - X = j and j ^ (B - j) = X, where i is the current value of A and j is the current value of B. This can be achieved by iterating over all possible values of X from 0 to i.

For memoization, initialize dp[0][j] = j for j in range(B+1), since if A=0, the minimum value of X would be equal to B. Then, iterate over all possible values of i and j, updating dp[i][j] accordingly.

The base case is when i or j is 0, where we simply return j as the minimum value of X.

The updated plan looks like this:
