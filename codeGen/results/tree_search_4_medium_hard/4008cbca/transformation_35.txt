===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression is a tuple (i, j) representing the current index i in the board string and the number of balls of the same color as the last ball inserted at position j.

The dynamic programming table stores the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from that position. 

We initialize a dictionary dp with default value -1 for each cell (i, j), where 0 ≤ i < len(board) and 0 ≤ j < 6 (assuming max 5 colors). This is because we don't know the minimum number of moves yet.

For the base case, if the current ball in the board string matches the color of the last ball inserted (j > 0), then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][k], where k is the index of the last ball inserted. This is because we can remove all balls by not inserting any more.

For the recursive case, if the current ball in the board string does not match the color of the last ball inserted (j == 0), then we try to insert a ball at this position and calculate dp[i-1][k] for each possible k. We update dp[i][0] as the minimum of these values plus 1.

To find the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls, we start from the last index i = len(board) - 1 and j = 5. If the value is still -1, it means it's impossible to remove all balls, so we return -1. Otherwise, we update dp[i][j] as the minimum number of moves needed.
