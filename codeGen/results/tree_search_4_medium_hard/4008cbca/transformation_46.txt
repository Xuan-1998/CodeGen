===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal approach is to use a bottom-up DP with memoization, where the state expression is the current board configuration, and the dynamic programming table stores the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from that configuration.

The state expression can be represented as (board_state, hand_state) where board_state is the current state of the board and hand_state is the number of balls in hand. The base case is when there are no more balls in hand (hand_state = 0).

To improve the plan, we can consider using a priority queue to select the most promising next move at each step, rather than simply considering all possible moves.

One potential issue with the plan is that it does not account for the fact that removing a ball from the board may make it easier to remove other balls in the future. To mitigate this, we can use a more advanced search strategy such as A* or IDA*, which take into account an estimate of the distance to the goal.

The plan also does not consider edge cases, such as what happens when there are no more balls in hand and it is still possible to remove some balls from the board. To handle this, we can add a special case to return -1 in this situation.

Here's the updated version:
