"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given a row of balls on a table and a set of balls in hand, find the minimum number of balls that need to be inserted into the row to remove all the balls. Balls can be inserted at any position and if there are three or more balls of the same color touching, they are removed. If it is not possible to remove all the balls, output -1.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of two strings: \\\"board\\\" representing the initial row of balls on the table and \\\"hand\\\" representing the balls in hand. The strings contain characters 'R','Y','B','G','W'. The input is provided through standard input.\\n\\nOutput: The output is an integer representing the minimal number of balls that need to be inserted to remove all the balls on the table. If it is not possible to remove all the balls, the output is -1.\\n\\nConstraints: The length of the \\\"board\\\" string is at most 20 and the length of the \\\"hand\\\" string is at most 5. The initial row of balls on the table won't have any 3 or more consecutive balls with the same color.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['String algorithms', 'Dynamic programming', 'Graph traversal']\", \"difficulties\": \"MEDIUM_HARD\", \"source\": \"leetcode\", \"url\": \"https://leetcode.com/problems/zuma-game/\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": [\"\\\"WRRBBW\\\"\", \"\\\"RB\\\"\"], \"output\": -1}]}"
