===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be the length of the current window being considered, and the dynamic programming table would store the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that point.

A base case would be when the board is empty. In this case, the minimum number of moves needed is 0.

To fill in the dynamic programming table, we iterate over the board from left to right. For each position, we consider three options:

1. Insert a ball at this position
2. Don't insert a ball at this position (i.e., just continue with the current state)
3. Try to remove all balls up to the current position

For option 1, we calculate the minimum number of moves needed by considering all possible ways to insert a ball and then removing all balls up to that point.

For option 2, we simply copy the value from the previous position in the dynamic programming table.

For option 3, we check if it's possible to remove all balls up to this point. If not, we set the minimum number of moves needed to -1 (indicating it's impossible). Otherwise, we recursively calculate the minimum number of moves needed for the remaining board and add the number of balls removed at this position.

The final answer would be the value in the dynamic programming table corresponding to the length of the entire board.
