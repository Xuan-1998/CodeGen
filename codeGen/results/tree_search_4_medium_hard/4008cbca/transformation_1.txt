===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be the length of the current window being considered, with the dynamic programming table storing the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that point.

The state could be a tuple (i, j) representing the current window of the board and hand, with i being the index of the last ball on the board and j being the number of balls in hand.
Let dp[i][j] be the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to the ith position on the board with j balls remaining in hand.

The base case would be when i is equal to the length of the board, representing the empty board. In this case, we only need to use the hand to remove any remaining balls, so dp[i][j] = min(j, len(hand)) for all j.

For the recursive case, let's consider two possibilities: either we insert a ball from our hand and then try to remove it with the next three balls on the board, or we don't insert this ball yet. If we do insert the ball, we need to add 1 to the minimum number of moves needed for the remaining part of the board.

On the other hand, if we don't insert this ball, we can consider only removing it later when we have three balls with the same color. In this case, we would add 3 to the minimum number of moves needed for the remaining part of the board minus one.

So, dp[i][j] = min(1 + dp[i - 1][j], 3 + dp[i - 4][j - 3]) if i >= 3 and j >= 3, otherwise it's min(j, len(hand)).

The final answer would be the value at dp[len(board)][len(hand)].
