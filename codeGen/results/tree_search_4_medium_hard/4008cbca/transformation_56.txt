===BEGIN PLAN===
A bottom-up tabulation approach could work by iterating through the board from left to right and keeping track of the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position. The state expression would be the current position in the board.

The state expression is a tuple (i, prev_color) where i is the current position in the board and prev_color is the color of the ball to the left of the current position.
State: (i, hand_colors[0]) where i is the current position in the board and hand_colors[0] is the color of the first ball in the hand

Design a recursive function that takes state (i, prev_color) as input and returns the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at position i with previous color j.

To handle edge cases:
- Initialize the dp array with -1 for each position, representing it's not possible to remove all balls
- Set the base case for the first ball on the board, considering there are no previous colors
