===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression is a pair (board_state, hand_state) where board_state is the current state of the board and hand_state is the number of balls in hand, and the base case is when there are no more balls in hand.

We use memoization to store the dynamic programming table. The key is the current position in the board, and the value is the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from that position.

The priority queue-based approach can be used to optimize the search process by always choosing the configuration with the least moves needed first.

We use a dictionary to store the dynamic programming table and perform lookups for subproblems. This way, we avoid recomputing the same subproblem multiple times.

The plan includes edge cases such as when there are no more balls in hand (base case) and when it is not possible to remove all the balls (output -1).
