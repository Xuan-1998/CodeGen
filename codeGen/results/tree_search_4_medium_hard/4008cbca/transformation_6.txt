===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be the length of the current window being considered and the color of the last ball removed, with the dynamic programming table storing the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that point. A base case would be when the board is empty.
The dynamic programming table (DP) would store the minimum number of moves required to remove all balls in each state.

Let's initialize the DP table:
- Initialize a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to i balls on the board, considering j balls are left in hand.
- For each cell, try to insert one ball from the hand into the board at different positions. This can be done by iterating over the board and trying to insert a ball with the same color as the last ball removed.

The recurrence relation would be:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j-1] + 1) for k ranging from i-1 to 0, where dp[k][j-1] is the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to k balls on the board, considering j-1 balls left in hand.

The base case would be when the board is empty (i == 0), then dp[0][j] = 0 because no more moves are needed.
- If it's not possible to remove all balls with the given number of balls left in hand, return -1.

This plan should work for the problem. However, there might be some edge cases that need to be handled. For example, if the board starts with an empty row and the hand has more than 5 balls, you would have to handle this case separately.
