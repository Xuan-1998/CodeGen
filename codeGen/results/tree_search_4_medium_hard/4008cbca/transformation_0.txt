===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be the tuple (i, j) representing the current window of the board and hand, with i being the index of the last ball on the board and j being the number of balls in hand. The dynamic programming table would store the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that point.

The base case would be when the board is empty (i.e., i == 0), in which case no moves are needed.

To fill in the DP table, for each state (i, j), we consider two possibilities: inserting a ball into the board or not. If we insert a ball, the new state would be (i+1, j-1) if j > 0, and we recursively call the DP function with this new state. If we don't insert a ball, the new state is just (i, j).

We choose the minimum number of moves between these two possibilities.

The final answer would be the value in the DP table when i is equal to the length of the board and j is 0 (since all balls have been removed).
