===BEGIN PLAN===
A bottom-up tabulation approach could work by iterating through the board from left to right and keeping track of the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position. The state expression would be the current position in the board.

The state expression is a tuple (i, prev_color) where i is the current position in the board and prev_color is the color of the ball to the left of the current position.

State: (i, min_moves[i]) where i is the current position in the board and min_moves[i] is the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that position

To improve the plan, you can add a base case for the first ball on the board. Since there's no previous color, you would need to initialize the memo dictionary with a special value (e.g., -1) indicating that it's not possible to remove any balls.

You also need to handle the edge cases where the current ball is different from the previous one. In this case, you just increment the minimum number of moves by 1.

Another improvement would be to sort the colors in the "hand" string and consider them in order. This way, you can always choose the color that will lead to the removal of the most balls with a single move.

Finally, you should include an edge case for when there are no balls left on the board. In this case, the minimum number of moves would be 0 because all balls have been removed.
