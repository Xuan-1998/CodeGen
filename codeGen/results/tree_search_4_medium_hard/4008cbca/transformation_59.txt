===BEGIN PLAN===
A bottom-up tabulation approach could work by iterating through the board from left to right and keeping track of the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position.

The state expression would be the current position in the board. The state expression is a tuple (i, prev_color) where i is the current position in the board and prev_color is the color of the ball to the left of the current position.

State: (i, prev_color) where i is the current position in the board and prev_color is the color of the ball to the left of the current position

Maintain a separate array for memoization and update it recursively based on the current state.

1. Initialize an empty dictionary dp to store the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position.
2. Iterate through the board from left to right, keeping track of the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position.
3. For each position i in the board:
    - If the ball at position i has the same color as the previous ball, increment the current minimum number of moves by 1.
    - Else, reset the minimum number of moves to 0.
4. Update dp with the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position.
5. Return the value in dp at the last position of the board.
