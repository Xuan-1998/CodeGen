===BEGIN PLAN===
A bottom-up tabulation approach could work by iterating through the board from left to right and keeping track of the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position.

Define the state as dp[i] which represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to position i. The base case would be when i is 0, and there are no balls to consider.

The state could also represent the count of each color ball type, with the transition being the update of this state based on the next ball in the board. The base case would be when i is 0, and there are no balls to consider.

The update rule for the state could be based on finding the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls when a ball of each color type is added at the current position i. To do this, iterate through each possible combination of adding a ball of each color and calculate the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls.

The plan can be improved by considering the edge cases where there are no balls in hand or the board is empty. The plan does not consider the case where it's not possible to remove all the balls, which would require additional logic.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
