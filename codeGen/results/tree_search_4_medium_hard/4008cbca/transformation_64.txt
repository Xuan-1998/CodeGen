===BEGIN PLAN===
A bottom-up tabulation approach could work by iterating through the board from left to right and keeping track of the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position. The state expression would be the current position in the board.

Define the state as dp[i] which represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to position i. The base case would be when i is 0, and there are no balls to consider.

Define the state as dp[i] which represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to position i. The state could be a tuple containing two values: (1) the current minimum number of moves and (2) a flag indicating whether the current position is 'clean' or not.

The recurrence relation for the dynamic programming approach would be as follows:
- If the current position is 'clean', then dp[i] = min(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + 1), where dp[i - 2] is the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to position i - 2.
- If the current position is not 'clean', then dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1, as at least one more ball needs to be inserted.

A dictionary-based memoization approach could be implemented by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary and checking for existing results before computing them. This would help avoid redundant computations and improve the efficiency of the algorithm.
