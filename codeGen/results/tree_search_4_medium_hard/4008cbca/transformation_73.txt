A bottom-up tabulation approach could work by iterating through the board from left to right and keeping track of the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position. The state expression would be (i, board[:i], hand) where i is the current position in the board, board[:i] is a list of colors of balls on the table up to position i, and hand is the list of available ball colors in hand.

The transition relationships would be defined based on whether it's possible to remove all the balls by inserting balls at the current position or not. The state expression could be updated as follows:

* If the current board[:i] has three consecutive balls of the same color, then we can remove them, so the minimum number of moves needed is 0.
* If the current board[:i] does not have three consecutive balls of the same color, then we need to consider the options:
	+ Insert a ball from hand that matches the color of the last ball on the table. This would reduce the size of the board[:i] list by one.
	+ Insert a ball from hand that does not match the color of the last ball on the table. This would keep the size of the board[:i] list the same.

The minimum number of moves needed at position i would be the minimum of these two options, plus one (for inserting a new ball).

To find the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls from the entire board, we would start with an initial state of (0, [], hand) and iterate through the board until we reach the end.

The final answer would be the value of the last element in this sequence, which represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls.

To memoize the recursive function, we could use a dictionary where the key is the current state (i, board[:i], hand) and the value is the minimum number of moves needed at that state. This would avoid redundant computation and speed up the solution.
