===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be the length of the current window being considered, and the dynamic programming table would store the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that point. The base case would be when the board is empty.
The state could be just the index i of the last ball on the board, with the dynamic programming table storing the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that point.
To use a 1D array where each element stores the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that point, considering the current ball on the board and the balls in hand.

For each cell in the DP table, we would consider inserting a ball at the current position (i.e., moving i) or not. If we insert a ball, we would recursively call the function for the remaining part of the board. We could also consider not moving i if it's not possible to remove all balls.

We should initialize the DP table with some base cases, such as when the board is empty (0 moves), and when there are no more balls in hand (also 0 moves).
We would fill up the DP table by considering each position on the board and updating the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls.

The final answer would be the value at the last cell in the DP table, which represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls.
