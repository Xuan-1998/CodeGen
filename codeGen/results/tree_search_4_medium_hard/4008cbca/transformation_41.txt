===BEGIN PLAN===
Another approach could be to use a bottom-up DP with tabulation, where the state expression is the current position in the board and the dynamic programming table stores the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from that position.

State expression is the length of the currently removable sequence of balls on the board, and the base case is when this sequence has 0 or 1 elements. This means we only need to consider sequences with at least two elements, since single balls can be removed immediately.

Use a 2D DP table where each cell (i, j) contains the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from position i and considering up to j balls in hand. The state transition is as follows:
- If the current ball on the board matches the topmost ball in hand, we can try to remove it by adding one move to the minimum number of moves for the remaining sequence.
- Otherwise, we cannot remove this ball immediately, so we need to add one to the minimum number of moves for the entire remaining sequence.

The base case is when i or j reaches the end of the board or hand, respectively. In this case, we can only remove balls that are already on the board, which has a constant cost (0 or 1).

Finally, we return the value at cell (0, len(hand)) as the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls.
