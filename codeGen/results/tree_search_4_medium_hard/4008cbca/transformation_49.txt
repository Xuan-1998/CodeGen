===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression is a tuple (board_config, hand_state) where board_config is the current row of balls on the table and hand_state is the number of balls in hand.
The base case is when there are no more balls in hand or when the entire board is empty.

To solve this problem, we can create a dictionary memo to store the memoized values. We will iterate through the board from left to right. For each cell in the board, we calculate the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from that position.
If the current state is not in the memo, we recursively call the function for the next state and update the memo with the result.

The recursive function takes two parameters: board_config and hand_state. It calculates the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from the given board configuration and using the given number of balls in hand.
It does this by iterating through the board, calculating the number of balls that can be removed at each position, and updating the memo with the result.

The base case is when there are no more balls in hand or when the entire board is empty. In these cases, we return 0 because no moves are needed to remove all balls.
If the current state is not in the memo, we recursively call the function for the next state and update the memo with the result.

Finally, we return the value from the memo for the initial state.
