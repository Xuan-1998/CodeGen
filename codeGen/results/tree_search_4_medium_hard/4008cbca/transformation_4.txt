===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be the length of the current window being considered, with the dynamic programming table storing the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that point.

To start, we initialize the dynamic programming table with a value for an empty board. Then, for each position on the board, we calculate the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that point by considering the following options:

1. If there are no balls in hand, the minimum number of moves is the same as the previous position.
2. Otherwise, consider inserting a ball at the current position and recursively calculate the minimum number of moves for the remaining positions.

We store the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that point in the dynamic programming table. This allows us to avoid recalculating the same sub-problems multiple times.

The base case is when the board is empty, at which point the minimum number of moves is 0.

The state expression could be the length of the current window being considered, with the dynamic programming table storing the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that point for each possible sub-board ending at a given position.
