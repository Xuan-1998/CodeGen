A bottom-up tabulation approach could work by iterating through the board from left to right and keeping track of the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position.

The state expression would be dp[i] where i is the current position in the board, representing the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that position.

The transition relationships would be defined as follows:

* If there are three or more consecutive balls with the same color on the board up to position i, and there are enough balls of the opposite color in hand, then dp[i] = 1 + dp[i-3]
* Otherwise, dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], 1 + dp[i-1]) if it's possible to insert a ball at position i to remove all balls up to that position

The base case would be when i is the length of the board, in which case dp[i] would represent the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls.

One possible way to implement this plan would be to use a loop to iterate through the board from left to right, and for each position, check if it's possible to insert a ball at that position to remove all balls up to that position. If so, calculate the minimum number of moves needed by considering two options: either insert a ball at that position (dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], 1 + dp[i-1])) or not insert a ball at that position (dp[i] = dp[i-1]).

The plan includes edge cases such as when i is the length of the board, in which case dp[i] would represent the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls. It also considers the possibility of inserting a ball at each position and removing all balls up to that position.
