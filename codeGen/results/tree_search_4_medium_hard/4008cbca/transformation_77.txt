===BEGIN PLAN===
A bottom-up tabulation approach could work by iterating through the board from left to right and keeping track of the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position.

The state expression would be (i, board[:i], hand) where i is the current position in the board, board[:i] is a list of colors of balls on the table up to position i, and hand is the list of available ball colors in hand. This allows us to consider all possible moves at each position.

The transition relationships would be defined based on whether it's possible to remove all the balls by inserting a ball of the same color or not. For each position i, we iterate through the available ball colors in hand and calculate the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to position i if we insert a ball of that color.

Another option could be to define the state as (i, count) where i is the current position in the board and count is the number of balls that need to be removed at that position. This approach would also involve iterating through the available ball colors in hand for each position i.

You can also use dynamic programming with a 1D table where the state expression is (i) and represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at position i of the board. This approach would be more efficient but might lose some information about the specific ball colors involved in the removal process.
