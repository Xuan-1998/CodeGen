===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be the last ball on the board, and the dynamic programming table storing the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls given this last ball.

State: The current set of balls in hand, with transitions defined by considering each possible insertion and updating the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls.
For each possible insertion:
  - Update the state expression with the new last ball on the board
  - Calculate the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls given this new last ball
  - Store it in a dictionary with the last ball as the key

Base case: When the board is empty, the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls is 0.
