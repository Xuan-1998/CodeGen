===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be a tuple (board_length, last_ball), representing the current length of the board and the color of the last ball on it. The dynamic programming table dp would store the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that point.

1. Initialize an empty dynamic programming table dp with dimensions (20 + 5, 5) (since max_length = 20 and max_hand = 5).
2. Set the base case when board is empty: dp[0][0] = 0.
3. For each position i on the board:
   - For each hand color j:
     - If the last ball on the board matches the current hand color, update dp[i][j] to be the minimum of dp[i-1][k] + 1 (where k is the color that was just removed) and dp[i-1][j].
4. The final answer would be dp[board_length][0], which represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls given the initial board state.
