===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression is dp[i][j], where i is the current position in the board and j is the length of the currently removable sequence of balls on the board.

State transition: 
- If there are 3 or more consecutive balls with the same color, they can be removed. We need to check if there are at least 3 consecutive 'R', 'Y', 'B', 'G', or 'W' characters in the board.
- The state expression is updated by considering all possible moves: 
    - Insert a ball of any color at position i (1 move).
    - If we have balls in hand, try to match them with the current sequence. This could involve inserting more balls of the same color as the last ball on the table.

Base case:
- The base case is when this sequence has 0 or 1 elements. In this case, no moves are needed.

Initialization: 
- Initialize dp[0][i] for all i, where i is the length of the removable sequence.
    - If there are balls in hand that can match with the current sequence on the board, we can remove them immediately (0 moves).
    - If there are no matching balls, then 1 move is needed to insert a ball that matches the last ball on the table.

State transition for j > 0:
- For each position i from left to right, 
    - Update dp[i][j] by considering all possible moves.
        + Insert a ball of any color at position i (1 move).
        + If we have balls in hand that match with the current sequence on the board, try to remove them immediately (0 moves).

Final answer: 
- The final answer is the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls on the table. This can be found by considering dp[n][j] for all j.
