===BEGIN PLAN===
A bottom-up tabulation approach could work by iterating through the board from left to right and keeping track of the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position.

The state expression would be the current position in the board. The transition relationships would be defined based on whether it's possible to remove all the balls by inserting balls at the current position or not.

For a given position i, we could define three possible states:
 1. If the current ball is of the same color as the previous two balls (left and right), then no move is needed to remove the current ball.
 2. If the current ball is of a different color than the previous two balls, then one move is needed to remove the current ball by inserting a ball of the same color as the previous two balls.
 3. If there are less than two balls on either side of the current ball (either left or right), then we need to consider all possible moves that could be made at this position.

The state would include the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to and including the current position i, as well as a flag indicating whether it's possible to remove all balls by inserting balls at the current position.

We can start by initializing an array dp of length m + 1 (where m is the length of the board) with all values set to infinity except for dp[0] which would be set to 0. This represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to and including the first position.

Then, we can iterate through the board from left to right, considering each possible state at each position i.
If it's possible to remove all balls by inserting a ball at the current position, then we update dp[i] with the minimum number of moves needed plus 1 (for the new move). If not, then we leave dp[i] as is.

Finally, we can return dp[m] which represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls from the entire board.
