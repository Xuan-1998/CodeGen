===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be the length of the current window being considered, with the dynamic programming table storing the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that point.

The dynamic programming table can be 1D, where each cell corresponds to a specific window size, and the value at each cell represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls within that window size. The state would not include the hand as it is already considered when updating the DP table.

The base case would be when the board is empty, in which case no moves are needed. This could be represented by a special value such as -1 or 0.

To update the DP table, for each cell representing a specific window size, you can consider all possible previous configurations that can lead to this state. If a configuration leads to a removal of balls, you would subtract the number of removed balls from the minimum moves needed to remove the remaining balls.

The plan does not include edge cases but it is a good starting point. It could be improved by considering the order in which balls are inserted into the board and how this affects the removal process.
