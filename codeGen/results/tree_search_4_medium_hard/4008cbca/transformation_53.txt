===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using top-down dynamic programming with memoization. The state expression is a pair (board_state, hand_state) where:
    - board_state: the current state of the board
    - hand_state: the number of balls in hand

The base case is when there are no more balls in hand.

To solve this problem, we can use a priority queue-based approach. The state expression is a pair (board_state, moves_needed) where:
    - board_state: the current configuration of the board
    - moves_needed: the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from that configuration

We apply top-down memoization using recursion and storing the results in a cache.

To improve this plan, we can:
    * Implement a more efficient data structure for the priority queue (e.g., binary heap) to reduce time complexity
    * Use a more sophisticated algorithm for updating the board state when inserting a ball
    * Handle edge cases such as an empty board or hand

This plan does not include edge cases, so we should add checks to handle these scenarios.
