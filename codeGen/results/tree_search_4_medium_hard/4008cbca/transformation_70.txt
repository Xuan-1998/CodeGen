A bottom-up tabulation approach could work by iterating through the board from left to right and keeping track of the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position.

Define the state as dp[i] which represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to position i. The base case would be when i is 0, and there are no balls to consider.

Use a dynamic programming table (dp) to keep track of the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to each position in the board. Initialize dp[0] as 0 since it's the starting point with no balls.

 Iterate through the board from left to right, considering each ball at position i:

* If the current ball is not part of a sequence of three or more same-colored balls, its removal would require one extra move.
* If the current ball is part of a sequence of three or more same-colored balls, its removal can be combined with the previous sequence, so it doesn't require an additional move.

Update dp[i] based on the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to position i-1 and the consideration above. The updated dp[i] would represent the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to position i.

To handle edge cases:

* If the board starts with a sequence of three or more same-colored balls, initialize dp[0] as 0 since we don't need any extra moves.
* If there are no balls in the hand, return -1 since it's impossible to remove all balls without inserting any.

The plan does not consider cases where the number of balls in the hand is less than the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls. This could be handled by updating dp[i] based on the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to position i-1 and the available balls in the hand.
