A bottom-up tabulation approach could work by iterating through the board from left to right and keeping track of the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position.

Define the state as dp[i][hand] which represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to position i with hand many colors of balls in hand. The base case would be when i is 0, and there are no balls to consider.

The transition equation could be: 
dp[i][hand] = min(dp[i-1][hand], dp[i-1][hand-1] + 1)

This means that at position i, we can either remove the current ball (dp[i-1][hand]) or insert a new ball (dp[i-1][hand-1] + 1) to make the current ball removable.

The initial state would be dp[0][hand] = [0 for _ in range(hand+1)] because we start with no balls and no moves needed.

Finally, return dp[-1][-1] as the answer, which represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls.
