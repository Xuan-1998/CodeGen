A bottom-up tabulation approach could work by iterating through the board from left to right and keeping track of the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position.

The state expression would be (i, board[:i], hand) where i is the current position in the board, board[:i] is a list of colors of balls on the table up to position i, and hand is the list of available ball colors in hand. The transition relationships would be defined based on whether it's possible to remove all the balls by inserting a ball of the same color or not.

The base case for the dynamic programming approach would be when there are no more balls left on the board (i.e., i == len(board)). In this case, the minimum number of moves needed is 0 if there are no balls in hand and -1 otherwise.

Memoizing the function by storing previously computed values for subproblems would allow us to avoid redundant computation and improve the efficiency of the algorithm.

The plan includes edge cases such as when the input board is empty or when all balls on the table have the same color. It also accounts for the possibility that it's not possible to remove all the balls, in which case the output would be -1.
