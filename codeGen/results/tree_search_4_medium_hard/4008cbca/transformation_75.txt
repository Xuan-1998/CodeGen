===BEGIN PLAN===
A bottom-up tabulation approach could work by iterating through the board from left to right and keeping track of the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position. The state expression would be (i, board[:i], hand) where i is the current position in the board, board[:i] is a list of colors of balls on the table up to position i, and hand is the list of available ball colors in hand.

The transition relationships would be defined based on whether it's possible to remove all the balls by inserting a ball of the same color or not. The state could be updated based on the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position, considering the possibilities of removing balls and the constraints imposed by the available colors in hand.

Another option could be to define the state as (i, count) where i is the current position in the board and count is the number of balls that need to be removed at that position. The transition relationships would be defined based on whether it's possible to remove all the balls by inserting a ball of the same color or not.

You can use dynamic programming with a 3D table where the state expression is (i, j, k) and represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at position i of the board given that you have used j balls from your hand and there are k colors remaining in hand. The base case would be when the board is empty or no more balls remain in hand.

The plan includes edge cases such as handling situations where it's not possible to remove all the balls, which could return -1.
