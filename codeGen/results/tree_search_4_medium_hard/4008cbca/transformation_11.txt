===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be the length of the current window being considered, with the dynamic programming table storing the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that point.

The transition relationships would be based on whether there are three or more consecutive balls of the same color in the board. If not, we can simply increment the state and move forward. If there are three or more, we need to "remove" them (by inserting a ball) and reset the state back to 0.

The DP table can be a 1D array where each cell [i] represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to index i on the board.

Base case: When the board is empty, the minimum number of moves needed is 0. This would be represented by the first cell in the DP table.

The plan would start by initializing the DP table and then iterate through the board, updating the state based on the transition relationships.
