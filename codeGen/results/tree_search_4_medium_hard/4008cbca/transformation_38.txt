===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming with memoization:

* Initialize a dynamic programming table dp of size (20 + 5) x (1), where 20 is the maximum length of the board and 5 is the maximum number of balls in hand. Fill it with initial values or -1, depending on the specific requirements.
* Define a function remove Balls(board, hand, position) that returns the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from the given position.
* Use memoization by storing the results of subproblems as they are solved, so that when the same problem is encountered again, its solution can be looked up instead of recomputed.
* In the function, for each ball on the board at the current position:
    + If there are three or more consecutive balls with the same color, remove them and update the dp table accordingly.
    + If not, insert a ball from the hand and update the dp table accordingly.
* Base case: when there are no more balls in the hand or the end of the board is reached, return 0 (no moves needed).
* Return the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from the given position.
