===BEGIN PLAN===
Another approach could be to use a top-down DP with memoization, where the state expression is the current position in the board and the dynamic programming table stores the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from that position.

State expression is whether each position in the board can be removed (True/False) and dynamic programming table stores the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from that position, using top-down DP with memoization.

To improve this plan:

* We need to define a recursive function to calculate the state transition.
* Calculate the base case when the sequence has 0 or 1 elements.
* Use memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.
* To remove edge cases, consider the initial conditions (e.g., what if there are no balls on the board?).
