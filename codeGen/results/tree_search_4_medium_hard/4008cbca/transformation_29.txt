===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be a tuple containing the length of the current window being considered and the last ball on the board, with the dynamic programming table storing the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that point given this window and last ball.

The base case would be when the board is empty, in which case the minimum number of moves is 0. The recursive relation could be as follows: 
- If the last ball on the board has the same color as the previous ball, then we can remove it immediately (minimum number of moves remains the same). 
- Otherwise, we need to consider two options:
    * Remove the current ball and add one more ball with the opposite color to the front of the queue. This would require an additional move.
    * Do not remove the current ball and keep adding balls to the end of the queue until we find a sequence of 3 or more same-colored balls, which can be removed in one operation.

The updated version of the plan is as follows:
