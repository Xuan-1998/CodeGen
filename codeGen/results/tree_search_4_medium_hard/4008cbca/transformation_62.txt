===BEGIN PLAN===
A bottom-up tabulation approach could work by iterating through the board from left to right and keeping track of the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position.

The state expression would be the current position in the board. The state expression is a tuple (i, prev_color) where i is the current position in the board and prev_color is the color of the ball to the left of the current position.

State: (i, min_moves[i]) where i is the current position in the board and min_moves[i] is the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that position

You can create a 1D array min_moves of size len(board), where min_moves[i] represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to position i.

Initialize the first element min_moves[0] with 0, as there are no previous positions to consider for the first ball.

For each position i from 1 to len(board) - 1:

    If the current color is different from prev_color:
        The minimum number of moves needed at this position is equal to the minimum number of moves needed at the previous position (min_moves[i-1]) plus 1, because we need to remove all balls up to this position.

    Else if the current color is the same as prev_color and there are more than two consecutive balls with the same color:
        The minimum number of moves needed at this position is equal to the minimum number of moves needed at the previous position (min_moves[i-1]) plus 1, because we need to remove all balls up to this position.

    Else: 
        The minimum number of moves needed at this position is equal to the minimum number of moves needed at the previous position (min_moves[i-1]), because no new balls are added and we can keep removing them as before.

Finally, return min_moves[-1] as the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls on the board. If it's not possible to remove all the balls, output -1.
