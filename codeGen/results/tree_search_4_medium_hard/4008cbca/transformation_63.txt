A bottom-up tabulation approach could work by iterating through the board from left to right and keeping track of the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position.

Define the state as dp[i] which represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to position i. The base case would be when i is 0, and there are no balls to consider.

The state could be a tuple containing two values: (1) the current minimum number of moves and (2) a flag indicating whether the current position is 'clean' or not. A position is considered 'clean' if it does not contain three or more consecutive balls with the same color.

Create a 1D array to store the dynamic programming table with dimensions len(board)+1, where dp[i] represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to position i. The extra element at the beginning is for the base case when i is 0.

Initialize the first element of the dp array as (0, True), indicating that no moves are needed and the initial position is 'clean'.

Iterate through the board from left to right. For each position i:

* If the current position is not 'clean', increment the minimum number of moves by 1.
* Update the flag to indicate whether the current position is 'clean' or not based on the colors of the balls at positions i-2, i-1 and i.

The final answer would be the value in dp[len(board)], which represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls from the board.
