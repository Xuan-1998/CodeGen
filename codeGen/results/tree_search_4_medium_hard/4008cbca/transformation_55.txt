A bottom-up tabulation approach could work by iterating through the board from left to right and keeping track of the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position.

The state expression would be the current position in the board. State: (i, hand_colors[0]) where i is the current position in the board and hand_colors[0] is the color of the first ball in the hand.

Use memoization by maintaining a dictionary memo where memo[(i, prev_color)] stores the result for state (i, prev_color).

To remove all balls at position i, we can either:
- Remove all balls on the left side of i that have the same color as the previous ball
- Or insert a new ball with the opposite color to the previous one

This decision depends on whether there are three or more consecutive balls of the same color. If there aren't, then we can remove them and add the new ball.

Memoize this process by storing the result for each state in memo[(i, prev_color)]. This way, we don't need to recalculate the result for the same state again.

The final answer is stored in memo[len(board) - 1, hand_colors[0]], which corresponds to the last position on the board and the color of the first ball in the hand.

For edge cases:
- If there are three or more consecutive balls of the same color at the beginning of the board, return -1
- If the number of colors in the hand is less than 2, return -1 because we cannot remove all balls with the given colors
