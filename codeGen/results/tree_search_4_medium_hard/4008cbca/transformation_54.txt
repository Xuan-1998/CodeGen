===BEGIN PLAN===
A bottom-up tabulation approach could work by iterating through the board from left to right and keeping track of the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at each position.

The state expression would be the current position in the board. The state expression is a tuple (i, prev_color) where i is the current position in the board and prev_color is the color of the ball to the left of the current position.
State: (i, hand_colors[0]) where i is the current position in the board and hand_colors[0] is the color of the first ball in the hand

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls at position i with previous color j.

For each position i on the board, iterate from left to right. For each iteration, update dp[i][prev_color] as follows:
- If there is no ball to the left (i.e., prev_color == None), initialize dp[i][None] as 0.
- Otherwise, calculate the minimum number of moves needed for this position by considering three options:
    * Remove the current ball if it matches with the previous color
    * Insert a new ball from hand if the current position does not have enough balls to match with the previous color
    * Do nothing and leave the current position as is

Update dp[i][prev_color] with the minimum number of moves calculated above.

Finally, return dp[-1][None], which represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls from the entire board.
