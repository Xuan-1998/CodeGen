===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be the length of the current window being considered, and the dynamic programming table would store the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that point.

A base case would be when the board is empty. This would mean a move count of 0.

The dynamic programming table could be initialized with values for the base case.

For each state in the table, consider the last ball on the board and the window length. If the last ball can be removed by matching it with a ball in hand, then subtract the number of moves needed to remove that ball from the total move count.

If not, then add 1 to the current window's move count and continue considering states where the window is one longer.

The plan could include edge cases such as handling the case when the board contains only one color and there are no balls in hand. In this case, it would be impossible to remove all the balls so the output should be -1.
