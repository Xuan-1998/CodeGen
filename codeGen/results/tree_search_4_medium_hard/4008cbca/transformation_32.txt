===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be a tuple containing the last ball on the board and the set of colors in hand, with the dynamic programming table storing the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that point given this last ball and set of colors.

The base case would be when the board is empty. The initial state would be an empty set representing no balls on the board and a set of colors in hand.

To determine the next state, consider the last ball on the board and the set of colors in hand. If there are three or more balls of the same color touching, they can be removed, reducing the size of the window by one. Otherwise, insert a new ball from the set of colors in hand that matches the last ball on the board to maintain the same window size.

The dynamic programming table would store the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to each state.
