===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be the last ball on the board, and the dynamic programming table storing the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls given this last ball.

State: The current set of balls in hand, with transitions defined by considering each possible insertion and updating the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls.
For every position in the board:
  - Consider inserting a ball from the hand at that position
  - Update the minimum number of moves needed based on whether the inserted ball would be removed or not
Store the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that point in a table indexed by the last ball on the board.
