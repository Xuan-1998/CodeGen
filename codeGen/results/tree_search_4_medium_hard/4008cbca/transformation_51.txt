===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression is (board_state, hand_state) where board_state is the current configuration of the board and hand_state is the number of balls in hand.
We can use a 2D dynamic programming table dp[][] to store the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from each possible board_state and hand_state.

Let's initialize the dynamic programming table with a size of (len(board) + 1) x (len(hand) + 1). The base case is when there are no more balls in hand, which means we only need to consider the initial state of the board.
We then iterate over the board and hand states simultaneously. For each cell dp[i][j], we check if it's possible to remove all balls starting from the current board_state and using j balls from the hand.

If it's possible, calculate the minimum number of moves needed by considering all possible next states: insert a ball into an empty space, swap two adjacent balls that are different colors, or move a single ball away from the end.
Finally, update dp[i][j] with the minimum value across all possible next states. If it's not possible to remove all balls, set dp[i][j] to -1.

The final answer is stored in dp[len(board)][len(hand)].
