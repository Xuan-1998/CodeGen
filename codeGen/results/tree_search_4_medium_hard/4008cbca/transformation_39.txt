===BEGIN PLAN===
A more accurate approach would be to use a bottom-up 2D dynamic programming (DP) table where rows represent positions in the board and columns represent lengths of removable sequences.

State expression is the current position in the board, and the DP table stores the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from that position. The state transition function would consider two cases: 
- If the current ball matches the end color of the last sequence removed, it can be added to the sequence.
- If not, a new sequence starts.

The base case is when the current position has 0 or 1 elements left. In this case, the minimum number of moves needed is either 0 (all balls are removable) or 1 (the last ball needs to be moved), respectively.

Initialize the DP table with a size of len(board) x max_length, where max_length is the maximum length of removable sequences.
Fill in the base cases: for i from 0 to len(board)-1, set dp[i][0] = 0 and dp[i][1] = 1.
For each position i from left to right:
- For each sequence length j from 2 to max_length:
    - Calculate the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from position i with a sequence of length j. This involves considering two cases: 
        - If the current ball matches the end color of the last sequence removed, it can be added to the sequence.
        - If not, a new sequence starts.
    - Update dp[i][j] with the minimum number of moves needed.

Finally, return dp[-1][-1], which represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from the end of the board.
