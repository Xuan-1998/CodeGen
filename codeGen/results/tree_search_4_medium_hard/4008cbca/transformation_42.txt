===BEGIN PLAN===
The approach is correct and it's a top-down DP with memoization.

State expression: The state expression should be the current removable sequence of balls on the board. This means that for each position in the board, we need to calculate the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from this position.
Base case: The base case is when the removable sequence has 0 or 1 elements. In this case, no moves are needed.

Dynamic Programming Table: We will use a dynamic programming table that stores the minimum number of moves needed to make the current ball removable. This means for each position in the board, we need to calculate the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from this position.
Bottom-up Tabulation: The state expression is not an index but the length of the currently removable sequence of balls on the board.

Top-down DP with memoization:
The top-down approach starts by trying to remove a ball at each possible position in the board, and then recursively removing the remaining balls. This approach helps to avoid repetitive work.
Memoization: Memoization is used to store the results of subproblems so that they don't need to be recalculated.

Edge Cases:
- What if there are no more removable balls on the board? In this case, we can return -1 because it's not possible to remove all balls.
- If the length of the "board" string is greater than 20 and the length of the "hand" string is greater than 5. We should handle these edge cases.
