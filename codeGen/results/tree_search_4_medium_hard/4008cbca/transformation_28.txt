===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression is the length of the current window being considered and the dynamic programming table stores the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to that point.

The base case is when the board is empty, which would have a value of 0.

The dynamic programming table could be represented as a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls up to the ith position on the board given that the last ball on the board was of color j.

To fill in the dp table, we would iterate over each position on the board and for each position consider all possible colors of the last ball on the board. If it's not possible to remove all balls with the current window size and last ball color, then we could set the value to -1 to indicate that it's impossible.

The state transition function would be based on whether or not we can remove all balls with the current window size and last ball color. If we can, then we add 1 to the minimum number of moves needed for the previous position and last ball color.

The final answer would be stored in dp[n][j] where n is the length of the board and j is the last ball on the board.
