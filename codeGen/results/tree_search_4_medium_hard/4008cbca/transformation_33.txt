===BEGIN PLAN===
Another approach could be to use a top-down DP with memoization, where the state expression is the current position in the board and the dynamic programming table stores the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from that position.

The state expression is a tuple (i, j) representing the current index i in the board string and the number of balls of the same color as the last ball inserted at position j. The DP table can be initialized with a value of -1 for each cell, since it's not possible to remove all balls initially.

The recursive function takes two parameters: the current index i and the number of balls of the same color j. It returns the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from position i considering the last ball inserted at position j. If the current ball is removed, the function recursively calls itself with the next index i + 1 and updated count j - 1. If a ball is inserted, the function adds 1 to the result of the recursive call.

The base case for the recursion is when all balls are removed (i.e., j == 0), in which case the minimum number of moves needed is 0. The DP table is then filled by calling the recursive function for each cell and storing the result.

Finally, the minimum number of moves needed to remove all balls starting from the beginning of the board can be found by looking up the value at position (0, 0) in the DP table.

If it's not possible to remove all balls (i.e., the value at (0, 0) is still -1), the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the minimum number of moves needed.
