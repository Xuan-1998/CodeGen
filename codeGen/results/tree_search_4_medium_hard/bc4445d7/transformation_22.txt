===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on a bottom-up approach with tabulation by initializing a 2D table and filling it up in a bottom-to-top manner, exploiting the optimal substructure.

The state is defined as dp[i][j] = minimum possible number of ones in the labels for nodes i to j, considering all edges between them.
dp[i][j] should represent the minimum number of 1's that can be achieved by labeling all edges from node i to j, considering all possible labelings for nodes in this range.

Use a 2D table to store dp[i][j] values where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of ones in labels from node i to j.
The base case is when i == j, set dp[i][j] = 0, because no edges need labeling.

Fill up the dp table by iterating over all possible pairs (i, j) and for each pair, calculate dp[i][j] as follows:
1. If i == j, set dp[i][j] = 0
2. For all k from i+1 to j-1, calculate dp[k][j] using the previously calculated values in the table.
3. Calculate dp[i][j] as the minimum of (dp[i][k-1] + 1) and dp[k][j], considering all possible labelings for edges between nodes i and k.

The final answer is the sum of all dp[i][n-1] values, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
