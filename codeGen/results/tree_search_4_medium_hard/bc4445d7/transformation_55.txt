===BEGIN PLAN===
Hypothesize a bottom-up approach with memoization, defining recursive relationships between subproblems, and iteratively refining the solution.

Define the state expression for each edge (u, v) as the product of all edge labels on the shortest path from u to v, with base case being edges that have only one child or are leaves.

Define a node's state as its depth in the tree, where the root is at depth 0, and use dynamic programming to compute the maximum possible distribution index for each edge (u, v), considering all nodes reachable from (u, v).

Memoizing the recursive function using a dictionary with node depths as keys.

Use the property that the product of all edge labels on the shortest path from u to v is equal to the product of the edge label on the edge (u, w) and the product of all edge labels on the shortest path from w to v for some intermediate node w. This allows us to avoid recomputation of subproblems.

Iteratively refine the solution by computing the maximum possible distribution index for each node, considering its children, until the root is reached.
