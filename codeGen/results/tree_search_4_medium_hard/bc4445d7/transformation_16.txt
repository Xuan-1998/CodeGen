===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for a dynamic programming solution where you maintain an array to store previously computed values, allowing you to avoid redundant computation.

Define the state expression as dp[i][j][k] = minimum possible product of integers on path from node i to node j when the sum of integers equals k.

Use memoization with a dictionary dp where dp[(i, j)] = minimum possible product of integers on path from node i to node j when the sum of integers equals k. This can be achieved by maintaining a dictionary dp where each key is a tuple (u, v) representing an edge and its value is the minimum possible product of integers on this edge.

Iterate over all edges in the tree and for each edge compute the minimum possible product of integers that ends at this edge given the sum of integers equals k. For each edge update dp[(u, v)] = min(dp[(u, v)], dp[(u, parent(u))] * dp[(parent(v), v)]).

Finally, calculate the maximum possible distribution index by iterating over all edges and updating it with the minimum product found on this edge.

Initialize dp dictionary with default value of infinity for each key representing an edge in the tree. This is to ensure that initially any path from a node u to a node v will not be counted.
