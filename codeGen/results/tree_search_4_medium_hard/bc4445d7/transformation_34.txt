===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on a bottom-up approach with tabulation by initializing a 2D table and filling it up in a bottom-to-top manner, exploiting the optimal substructure.

The state is defined as dp[i] = maximum sum of f(u,v) values over all pairs (u,v) where u is a node with at most i children and v is its child, considering all possible ways to label the edges.

dp[i][0] = 0

Initialize dp[0] as an array of size n+1 where dp[0][j] represents the maximum sum of f(u,v) values over all pairs (u,v) where u is a node with at most j children and v is its child. 

For each edge (u,v), consider labeling it with numbers 1 to i, inclusive.

dp[i-1][k] + (i-1)!/(i-k)!*(n-i) when k+1 edges are labeled

Fill up dp[0] based on the above recursive formula.

Iterate through all test cases and for each edge, calculate the maximum sum of f(u,v) values considering all possible ways to label the edges.

Finally, print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
