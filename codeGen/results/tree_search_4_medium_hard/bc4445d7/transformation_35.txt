===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on a bottom-up approach with tabulation by initializing a 2D table and filling it up in a bottom-to-top manner, exploiting the optimal substructure.

The state is defined as dp[i][j] = maximum sum of f(u,v) values over all pairs (u,v) where u is a node with at most i children, v is its child with j edges labeled from 1 to p, and considering all possible ways to label the edges.

dp[0][j] = 0
Initialize dp[i][j] for i = 1 to n-1 and j = 1 to m (the number of prime factors)
For each edge (u,v), consider labeling its corresponding integer as x where x is a product of some of the prime factors.
Compute f(u,v) for this labeling, which is the sum of numbers on the simple path from u to v.

Memoize recursive function calls by storing intermediate results in a dictionary, then look up the memoized value instead of recalculating it. This approach avoids redundant computation and reduces time complexity.

For each edge (u,v), calculate the contribution of this edge's labeling to dp[i][j] where i is the number of children of u, j is the number of edges labeled from 1 to p.
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] + f(u,v)) for all possible k and labelings that result in f(u,v).

Fill up the table dp[][] in a bottom-to-top manner. 
For the root node (1), calculate the maximum sum of f(u,v) values over all pairs (u,v) where u is the root and v is its child, considering all possible ways to label the edges.
This value represents the maximum possible distribution index.

Print the value of dp[0][j] modulo 10^9 + 7 as the answer for each test case.
