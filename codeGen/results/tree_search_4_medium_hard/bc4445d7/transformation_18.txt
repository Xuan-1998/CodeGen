===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using top-down memoization for a dynamic programming solution where you maintain a dictionary to store previously computed values, allowing you to avoid redundant computation.

Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = minimum possible distribution index of the tree when node i is the root and edge labels are [1..j].

dp[0][0] = 0 (base case)

Consider using memoization for a recursive function that calls itself with smaller subproblems and stores the results in a dictionary to avoid redundant computation.

Function to calculate dp[i][j]:
    - If j == 0, return dp[i-1][j-1] + i
    - If there are no more edges left (i.e., j == n-2), return dp[i-1][n-2]
    - Otherwise, consider two cases:
        * Case 1: The edge between node i and the next node is labeled with a prime factor.
            Calculate dp[i+1][j-1] + i
        * Case 2: The edge between node i and the next node is not labeled with a prime factor.
            Calculate dp[i-1][n-2] + i

Store the results in a dictionary to avoid redundant computation.

Finally, calculate and return the maximum possible distribution index of the tree by summing up all values in the dp array.
