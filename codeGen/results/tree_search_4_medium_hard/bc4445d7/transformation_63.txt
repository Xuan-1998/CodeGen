===BEGIN PLAN===
Hypothesize a bottom-up approach with memoization, defining iterative relationships between subproblems, and iteratively refining the solution.

Define the state expression for each edge (u, v) as a tuple containing the sum of edge labels on the path from u to v and the number of 1s among all edge labels on the path from u to v.

Consider a node's state as a tuple containing its distance to the root, the sum of edge labels on the path from it to the root, and the number of 1s among all edge labels on the path from it to the root, utilizing dynamic programming to find the maximum possible distribution index.

Design a memoized function that uses an iterative formula to calculate the state expression for each node i, storing the results in a dictionary and returning the cached value if it already exists.

For each edge (u, v), calculate its state by iterating over all edges in the subtree rooted at u, updating the sum of edge labels on the path from u to v and the number of 1s among all edge labels on the path from u to v as you go.

Iterate over all nodes i in the tree, calculating their states using the memoized function and updating the maximum possible distribution index accordingly.

Finally, calculate the maximum possible distribution index by summing up the states of all nodes i in the tree.
