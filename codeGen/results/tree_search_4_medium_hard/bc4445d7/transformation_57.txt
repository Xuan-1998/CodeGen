===BEGIN PLAN===
Hypothesize a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming and memoization, defining recursive relationships between subproblems, and iteratively refining the solution.

Define the state expression for each node i as the product of edge labels on the shortest path from i to the root, with base case being nodes that have only one child or are leaves.
This can be represented as dp[i] = k / (dp[u1] * ... * dp[uk-1]) where ui is the parent of node i and uk-1 is the last child of node i.

Define a state transition function that updates the maximum possible distribution index for each node based on its children, considering the number of ones in the product. This can be represented as
dp[i] = k / (dp[u1] * ... * dp[uk-1]) where ui is the parent of node i and uk-1 is the last child of node i.

Memoize the state transition function to avoid redundant calculations.
Use dynamic programming to compute the maximum possible distribution index for each node, considering its children. This can be represented as
dp[i] = k / (dp[u1] * ... * dp[uk-1]) where ui is the parent of node i and uk-1 is the last child of node i.

Compute the maximum possible distribution index for all nodes by iteratively applying the state transition function.
Print the maximum possible distribution index modulo 10^9 + 7.
