===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for a dynamic programming solution where you maintain an array to store previously computed values, allowing you to avoid redundant computation.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = minimum product of (n-1) integers such that the sum of integers on path from node i to j equals k.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[u][v] + f(u, v)) for all edges (u, v)

Memoize the state dp[i][j] as a function of only i and j, rather than also considering k. This can be achieved by maintaining an array dp of size n x n where dp[i][j] is calculated based on dp[u][v] for all edges (u, v) such that u < i and v > j.

This approach seems correct in identifying the state transition and the need for memoization.

To improve this plan:

- Consider a more efficient way to update dp[i][j], perhaps using a priority queue to prioritize nodes based on their distance from node i or j.
- To avoid redundant computation, consider sorting edges by their indices and then iterating over them to compute dp[i][j].

Potential issues with the plan:

- It does not handle edge cases where there are no valid paths between two nodes. This can be handled by returning a special value such as negative infinity for these cases.

This updated plan includes edge cases:
