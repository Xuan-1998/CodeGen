===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on a top-down approach with memoization by initializing a 2D table and filling it up in a bottom-to-top manner, exploiting the optimal substructure.

The state is defined as dp[i][j] = maximum sum of f(u,v) values over all pairs (u,v) where u is a node with at most i children and v is its child, considering all possible ways to label the edges.
dp[i][j] = max(dp[k-1][k-1] + f(k,j)) for all k from j+1 to n

Memoize intermediate results using a dictionary to store the redundant computations.

Iterate through each node i and calculate dp[i][n-i] as the maximum possible distribution index for nodes 1 to i.
Add up all values in the last column of the table to get the final result.
Modulo it by (10^9 + 7) at the end to satisfy the constraint.
