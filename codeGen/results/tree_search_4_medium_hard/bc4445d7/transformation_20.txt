===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for a dynamic programming solution where you maintain an array to store previously computed values, allowing you to avoid redundant computation.

Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = minimum possible product of integers on path from node i to node j when nodes i and j are connected by an edge.

Use dynamic programming to build a 2D array dp[][] where dp[i][j] is the minimum possible product of integers on path from node i to node j when nodes i and j are connected by an edge.

For each edge (u, v), update dp[u][v] = min(dp[u][v], (dp[u][p] * dp[p][v]) mod (10^9 + 7)) where p is the parent of u or v in the tree.

Finally, calculate and print the maximum possible distribution index as sum((i <= j) ? dp[i][j] : -dp[j][i]) mod (10^9 + 7) for all edges in the tree.
