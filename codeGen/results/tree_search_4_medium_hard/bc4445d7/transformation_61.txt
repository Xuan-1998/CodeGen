===BEGIN PLAN===
Hypothesize a top-down approach with memoization, defining recursive relationships between subproblems, and iteratively refining the solution.

Define the state expression for each node i as the sum of edge labels on the simple path from i to any other node j, considering nodes that have only one child or are leaves as base cases.

Consider a node's state as a tuple containing its distance to the root, the sum of edge labels on the path from it to the root, and the product of all edge labels on the path from it to the root, utilizing dynamic programming to find the maximum possible distribution index.

You can define a memoized function that recursively calculates the state expression for each node i, storing the results in a dictionary and returning the cached value if it already exists. Then, use this memoized function to calculate the maximum possible distribution index by summing up the states of all nodes except the root.
