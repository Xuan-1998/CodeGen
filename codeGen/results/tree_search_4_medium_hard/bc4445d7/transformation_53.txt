===BEGIN PLAN===
Hypothesize a bottom-up approach with memoization, defining recursive relationships between subproblems, and iteratively refining the solution.

1. Define the base case: For a tree with 2 nodes, there is only one possible edge label configuration that satisfies the product of all integers being equal to k. This base case will serve as a starting point for our dynamic programming approach.

2. Recursively define subproblems:
   - Consider a subtree rooted at node u.
   - Compute the sum of edge labels on the path from node u to each of its children, vi and vj (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n).
   - Store these sums in a memoization table, mapping each node to its corresponding sum.

3. Iterate through nodes: Starting from leaf nodes, iteratively compute and store the solution for smaller subproblems before solving larger ones.
   - For each node u:
     - If u is a leaf node (i.e., it has no children), skip it and move on to the next node.
     - Otherwise, recursively calculate the sum of edge labels on the path from u to each of its children, vi and vj.
     - Update the memoization table with this new information.

4. Combine results: For each node u, compute the maximum possible distribution index by adding up the sums for all subtrees rooted at u's children and the product of the edge labels on edges connected to u.

5. Return the maximum possible distribution index for the entire tree as the final answer.
