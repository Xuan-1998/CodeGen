===BEGIN PLAN===
Hypothesize a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming and memoization, defining recursive relationships between subproblems, and iteratively refining the solution.

\
\
Store intermediate results in a 2D table where rows represent nodes, columns represent edge labels, and cells contain the maximum sum of edge weights for each node and each label. This allows you to efficiently look up the optimal tree structure.

\

Compute the maximum sum for leaf nodes first (i.e., nodes with no children). For non-leaf nodes, recursively compute the maximum sum by considering all possible edge labels and adding the maximum sum of their child nodes.

\
\
Backtrack to construct the optimal tree structure by tracing the maximum sum for each node and its parent node. This ensures that the product of all edge labels equals the given number k.

\
\
Finally, calculate the distribution index as the sum of the sums of simple paths from each node to every other node. Print the result modulo 10^9 + 7.
