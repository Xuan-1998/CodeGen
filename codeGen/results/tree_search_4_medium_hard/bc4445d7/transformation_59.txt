===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the state expression for each node i as the product of edge labels on the shortest path from i to the root, with base case being nodes that have only one child or are leaves.

Let dp[i][j] be the product of edge labels on the shortest path from node i to its parent j. 

For a leaf node i (i.e., it has no children), set dp[i][0] = 1. 
For any other node i, let p be the minimum number such that p is not one of the previously chosen numbers and k/p is in the list of prime factors. If k/p is already used, then find the next smallest unused prime factor. If all are used, set p as 1.

Now, consider a non-leaf node i with children c1, c2, ..., ck. For each child ci, calculate dp[i][ci] using memoization and the base cases. 

For leaf nodes, recursively call the function to compute the product of edge labels on the shortest path from the root to that leaf node.

Finally, return the sum of all products of edge labels on the shortest paths from a node to its parent.
