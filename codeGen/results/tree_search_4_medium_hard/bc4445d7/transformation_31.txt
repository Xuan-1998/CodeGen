===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on a bottom-up approach with tabulation by initializing a 2D table and filling it up in a bottom-to-top manner, exploiting the optimal substructure.

The state is defined as dp[i] = maximum sum of f(u,v) values over all pairs (u,v) where u is a node with at most i children and v is its child, considering all possible ways to label the edges. However, we should consider that each edge has two endpoints, so the state should be dp[i][j] for 1 <= j <= n.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] + f(i,k,j)) for all k from 1 to i+1 (not n) and j from 1 to k

The base case is when there's only one node left, which has no children. In this case, the maximum sum is 0.

We should also consider the constraint that the product of all edge labels equals a given number k, which consists of m prime factors p_1, ..., p_m. To incorporate this into our dynamic programming, we can keep track of the current product of edge labels and update it accordingly as we fill up the table.

Initialize a 2D table dp with size n+1 x (n+1), where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of f(u,v) values over all pairs (u,v) where u is a node with at most i children and v is its child, considering all possible ways to label the edges.

Fill up the table in a bottom-up manner. For each cell dp[i][j], consider all possible ways to add an edge from j-th node to some other node k (1 <= k <= i+1). The maximum sum is the one that gives us the maximum product of edge labels.

For each test case, calculate and print the answer as the maximum sum over all pairs (u,v) where u is a node with at most n children and v is its child.
