===BEGIN PLAN===
Define a function dp(n, k) that returns the maximum possible distribution index for a tree with n nodes and product k.

1. Base case: If n == 2, return 0 because there is only one edge in a tree with two nodes.

2. Recursive case:
    - For each prime factor p of k, consider placing it on an edge between node u and node v.
    - Calculate the maximum possible distribution index for the subtrees rooted at u and v (using dp(v, k/p) if n > 2).
    - Add the sum of the numbers on the simple path from u to v to the maximum possible distribution indices of the two subtrees.
    - Repeat this process for all prime factors p of k.

3. Memoization: Store the results of subproblems in a memo array dp[] and use it to avoid redundant computations.

4. Main function:
    - Read the input n, m, and k.
    - Calculate the maximum possible distribution index using the recursive formula.
    - Print the result modulo 10^9 + 7.
