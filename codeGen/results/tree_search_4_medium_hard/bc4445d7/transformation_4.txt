===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for a dynamic programming solution where you maintain an array to store previously computed values, allowing you to avoid redundant computation.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = minimum product of (n-1) integers such that the sum of integers on path from node i to j equals k, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible distribution index for subtree rooted at node i with k as its product.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[u][v] + f(u, v)) for all edges (u, v)

Use memoization to store previously computed values of dp[u][v] for all edges (u, v) in the tree. 

For each edge (u, v), calculate and store the minimum product value dp[u][v]. This can be done by iterating over all possible products of integers on path from node u to node v that equal k.

Calculate the sum of integers on path from node i to j as f(i, j) = Σ(x * logx for x in (u, v)) where (u, v) are the edges on this path. 

Update dp[i][j] with minimum value found.

The final answer is ΣΣdp[u][v] for all edges (u, v) in the tree, which represents the maximum possible distribution index for the given tree.
