===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for a dynamic programming solution where you maintain an array to store previously computed values, allowing you to avoid redundant computation.

Define the state expression as dp[u][v][p][s] = minimum possible product of integers on path from node u to node v when the sum of integers equals p and number of 1s is at most s.

To initialize dp array, set dp[i][j][k][l] = âˆž for all i, j, k, l. For each edge (u, v), update dp[u][v][f(u, v)][count(1's)] by considering the minimum product of numbers on path from u to v when sum equals f(u, v) and number of 1s is at most count(1's).

For each node i, iterate over its neighbors j, and calculate the number of 1s and the product of numbers on the path from i to j. Update dp[i][j] using the minimum possible product.

To get the maximum distribution index, sum up all values in dp array and print it modulo 10^9 + 7.
