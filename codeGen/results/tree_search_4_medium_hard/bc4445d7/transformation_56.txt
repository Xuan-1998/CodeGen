===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the state expression for each node i as the product of edge labels on the shortest path from i to the root, with base case being nodes that have only one child or are leaves.

Let dp[i] denote the maximum possible distribution index for node i. For a leaf node i, set dp[i] = 0 since there's no contribution to the maximum possible distribution index.

For an internal node i with children j1, ..., jm, recursively compute the maximum possible distribution indices for each child and update dp[i] as follows:

dp[i] = min(dp[j1], ..., dp[jm]) + sum(f(i, ji) * (i != ji)) where f(i, v) is the product of edge labels on the simple path from node i to node v.

Using a bottom-up approach with memoization by defining and updating a table of node states in order of increasing depth. Start with nodes at depth 0, then iteratively update the states for each node as you move up the tree.

Compute the maximum possible distribution index for the root node (at depth 0) to be the maximum possible distribution index for the entire tree.
