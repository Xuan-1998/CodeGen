===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for a dynamic programming solution where you maintain an array to store previously computed values, allowing you to avoid redundant computation.

The state expression is dp[i][j][k] = 1 if there exists an edge between nodes i and j such that their labels add up to k, otherwise 0, where dp[i][j][k] represents whether the edge (i, j) has label k or not.

dp[u][v][label] = 1 if the path from u to v has label as a prefix and sum of labels on this path equals k, otherwise 0.

Create a memoized function that takes in node pair (u, v) and prime factor k, and returns whether there exists an edge between nodes u and v such that their labels add up to k, considering previously computed values.

Initially, create a 2D array dp of size n x n with all elements initialized as 0. This will store the memoized values for each node pair (u, v) and prime factor k.

For each edge (u, v), iterate over the prime factors p1 to pm and check if there exists an edge between nodes u and j such that their labels add up to p1, where j is any node in the tree. If yes, set dp[u][v][p1] = 1.

Now, for each node pair (u, v) and prime factor k, use memoization to find whether there exists an edge between nodes u and v such that their labels add up to k.

Finally, calculate the maximum possible distribution index of the tree by summing over all edges and prime factors, considering previously computed values.
