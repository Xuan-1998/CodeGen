===BEGIN PLAN===
Hypothesize a top-down approach with memoization, defining recursive relationships between subproblems, and iteratively refining the solution.

Define the state expression for each node i as the product of edge labels on the shortest path from i to the root, with base case being nodes that have only one child or are leaves.

Formulate the state as the maximum possible distribution index of the tree, using memoization to avoid redundant computation. Define a dynamic programming table dp[node] where each cell dp[i] stores the maximum possible distribution index of the subtree rooted at node i.

Define recursive relationships between subproblems:

1. For nodes with only one child, the maximum possible distribution index is 0.
2. For leaves, the maximum possible distribution index is the product of edge labels on the path from the leaf to its parent.
3. For non-leaf nodes i, the maximum possible distribution index is the sum of:
   a. The product of edge labels on the path from node i to its parent.
   b. The maximum possible distribution index of the subtree rooted at each child j of node i.

Iteratively refine the solution by computing the maximum possible distribution index for each node and updating the dynamic programming table accordingly.

Finally, return the maximum possible distribution index of the entire tree as the result.
