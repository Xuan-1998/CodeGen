===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on a bottom-up approach with tabulation by initializing a 2D table and filling it up in a bottom-to-top manner, exploiting the optimal substructure.

The state is defined as dp[i][j] = minimum possible number of ones in the labels for nodes i to j, considering all edges between them.
dp[i][j] could be the maximum product that can be achieved by multiplying all labels on the path from node i to j

DP using a 2D table with O(n*m) space complexity, where n is the number of nodes and m is the maximum possible product.

Initialize dp[][] table with size (n,n), and fill it up in bottom-to-top manner:
For each edge (u,v):
    Calculate minimum possible ones for edges from u to v
    Update dp[u][v] with this value

Finally, calculate sum(f(i,j)) over all i <= j pairs, which represents the maximum possible distribution index.
