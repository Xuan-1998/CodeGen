===BEGIN PLAN===
state is a 2D table where the first dimension represents node indices and the second dimension represents the number of ones on the path from the root to that node; initialize it with zeros.
Create a recursive function that calculates the maximum possible distribution index for each subtree rooted at node i, given the current state at node i.
The base case is when processing nodes that have no children, as there's only one way to distribute ones among their edges.
state[i][ones] = state[children][ones-1] + (ones == 0 ? 1 : -1) for each child c of node i;
Create a main function that iterates over all nodes and calculates the maximum possible distribution index for each subtree rooted at each node; fill up the state table in a bottom-to-top manner, considering each node as its own subtree.
state[0][0] = 0; //root has no ones
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j <= ones[i]; j++) {
        state[i][j] = state[children[i]][j-1] + (j == 0 ? 1 : -1);
    }
}
return state[n-1][ones[n-1]];
