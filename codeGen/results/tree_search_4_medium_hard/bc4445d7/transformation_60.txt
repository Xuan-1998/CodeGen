===BEGIN PLAN===
Hypothesize a dynamic programming approach with memoization.

Define the state expression for each node i as dp[i]: product of edge labels on the shortest path from i to the root.

Formulate recursive relationship: 
dp[i] = product(edge_labels) if i is leaf or has only one child
dp[i] = (product(edge_labels)) * dp[parent] otherwise

Memoize to avoid redundant computation.

Use bottom-up approach by defining iterative formula for dp[i]: sum of f(i, j) over all children j of i.
f(i, j) = product(edge_labels) on the path from i to j if i is not the root
f(root, j) = 1 otherwise
