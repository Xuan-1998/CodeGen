===BEGIN PLAN===
Hypothesize a top-down approach with memoization, defining recursive relationships between subproblems, and iteratively refining the solution.

Define dp[i][j] as the maximum possible distribution index for the subtree rooted at node i, considering all edges from i to j.

Use memoization with an implicit loop that recursively explores all possible subtrees and sums their values. The function f(i) will return the sum of values for a tree rooted at node i.

Initialize a table dp[1..n][1..n] where n is the number of nodes, filled with zeros or any value that won't interfere with our calculation.

Iteratively refine the solution by updating each cell in the table based on its neighbors. The maximum possible distribution index for a subtree rooted at node i will be the sum of values from all subtrees rooted at node j where 1 <= j < i, and then subtracting the value of the edge connecting nodes i and j.

Iteratively compute f(i) by exploring all possible subtrees rooted at each node i, until we reach leaf nodes (i.e., nodes with no children).

Finally, return f(1), which represents the maximum possible distribution index for the entire tree.
