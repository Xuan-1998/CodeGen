Plan:
===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for a dynamic programming solution where you maintain an array to store previously computed values, allowing you to avoid redundant computation.

Define the state expression as dp[i][j][k][l] = minimum possible product of integers on path from node i to node j when the sum of integers equals k and number of 1s is at most l.

dp[i][j][k][l] = minimum possible product of integers on path from node i to node j when the sum of integers equals k, number of 1s is l, and nodes i and j are connected by an edge

Create a memoized function that takes in the current state (i, j, k, l) and recursively calculates dp[i][j][k][l] based on previously computed values.

For each query, calculate all possible products of integers from node i to node j when the sum equals k, number of 1s is at most l. Store these results in a dictionary and use this dictionary as memoization for future queries.

When calculating dp[i][j][k][l], consider all previous nodes that are connected to either i or j and recursively calculate their contributions.

At each step, update the product and count of 1s accordingly. If the current node is not connected to any other nodes, set its contribution as k.

Finally, return the minimum possible product of integers on path from node i to node j when the sum equals k and number of 1s is at most l.

This plan seems correct for solving this problem.
