===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for a dynamic programming solution where you maintain an array to store previously computed values, allowing you to avoid redundant computation.

Define the state expression as dp[i][j][k][l] = minimum possible product of integers on path from node i to node j when the sum of integers equals k and number of 1s is at most l.
dp[i][j][0][0] = 1 (base case for empty path)
For each edge (u, v), calculate dp[u][v][k][l] as follows:
    - If k is not divisible by any prime factors from the given list, return -1 (no solution exists).
    - If l is greater than the number of 1s on the edge, update l to be one less.
    - Calculate and store the minimum possible product for all possible values of integers on the edge that satisfy the conditions.

Implement memoization by defining a function that takes in (i, j, k, l) as input and returns the corresponding value in dp[][]; use this function to avoid redundant computation.

To find the maximum possible distribution index, iterate through all edges and calculate the sum of products for each path. Update the maximum distribution index if necessary.
