===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for a dynamic programming solution where you maintain an array to store previously computed values, allowing you to avoid redundant computation.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = minimum product of (n-1) integers such that the sum of integers on path from node i to j equals k, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible distribution index for subtree rooted at node i with k as its product.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[u][i] + j-u+1 + dp[v][j] + v-j+1) for all nodes u and v in subtree rooted at i

Memoize the state expression using a 2D array where dp[i][j] is the minimum product of (n-1) integers such that the sum of integers on path from node i to j equals k, and update the memoized values using a bottom-up approach.

Initialize a 2D array with size n*n filled with -1, and set all diagonal elements to 0 since there are no edges in a subtree rooted at a leaf node.

For each edge (u, v), update dp[u][v] as min(dp[u][v], dp[u][v-1] + 1 + dp[v][v])

Finally, return the maximum possible distribution index which is the sum of all non-diagonal elements in the dp array.
