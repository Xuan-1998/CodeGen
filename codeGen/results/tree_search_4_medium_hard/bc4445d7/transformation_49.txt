===BEGIN PLAN===
Hypothesize a top-down approach with memoization, defining recursive relationships between subproblems, and iteratively refining the solution.

Let dp[i] be the maximum possible distribution index for node i. For each node i, calculate the maximum possible distribution index by considering all its children j. This can be done using the following recursive relation:

dp[i] = âˆ‘[j=1 to n-1](f(i,j) * (1 + dp[j]))

where f(i,j) is the sum of the numbers on the simple path from node i to node j.

Memoize each node's value separately by maintaining a dynamic array to store intermediate results for faster lookup. This can be implemented using a vector or an array.
