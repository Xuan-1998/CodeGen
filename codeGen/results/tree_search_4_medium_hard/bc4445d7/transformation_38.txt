===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on a bottom-up approach with tabulation by initializing a 3D table and filling it up in a bottom-to-top manner, exploiting the optimal substructure. 
There exists a base case when processing nodes that have no children, as there's only one way to distribute ones among their edges.
state is a 3D table where the first two dimensions represent node indices, and the third dimension represents the number of ones on the path from the root to that node; the state transition happens when moving down the tree, incrementing the number of ones on each edge;
Design a function that takes a node's index and the current total count of ones as input, then recursively calculates the minimum possible count of ones on the path from this node to all its children, based on the given edge labels; store the result in the state table. 
Calculate the maximum possible distribution index by summing up the values in the state table for each pair of nodes and multiplying it with the product of the given prime factors; 
Print the final result modulo 10^9 + 7.
