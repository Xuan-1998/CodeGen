===BEGIN PLAN===
Hypothesize a top-down approach with memoization, defining recursive relationships between subproblems, and iteratively refining the solution.

Define the state expression for each node i as the product of edge labels on the shortest path from i to the root, considering nodes that have only one child or are leaves as base cases. This allows us to compute the maximum possible distribution index recursively.

Consider a node's state as a tuple containing its distance to the root and the sum of edge labels on the path from it to the root, utilizing dynamic programming to find the maximum possible distribution index. This ensures that we only consider the shortest path from each node to the root when computing its state.

Use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming, constructing a table to store the state expressions for each node i based on its children's states and edge labels. This enables us to efficiently compute the maximum possible distribution index by iteratively refining our solution.

Construct a 2D array dp[][] where dp[i][j] represents the sum of edge labels on the path from node i to node j, with base cases being nodes that have only one child or are leaves. Iterate through all nodes and their children, updating the state expression for each node based on its children's states and edge labels.

Finally, compute the maximum possible distribution index by iterating through all nodes and considering the shortest paths from each node to the root when computing its state.
