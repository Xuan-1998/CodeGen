===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for a dynamic programming solution where you maintain an array to store previously computed values, allowing you to avoid redundant computation.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = minimum product of (n-1) integers such that the sum of integers on path from node i to j equals k, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible distribution index for subtree rooted at node i with edge j.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[u][v] + f(u, v)) for all edges (u, v)

Implement memoization using a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible distribution index for subtree rooted at node i with edge j. Initialize dp[i][j] to infinity.

To avoid redundant computation and optimize the solution, consider implementing a top-down approach starting from node n and propagating down to node 1.
