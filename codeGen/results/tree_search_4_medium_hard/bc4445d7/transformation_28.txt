===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on a bottom-up approach with tabulation by initializing a 2D table and filling it up in a top-to-bottom manner, exploiting the optimal substructure.

The state is defined as dp[i][j] = maximum possible distribution index for nodes i to j, considering all edges between them. The initial state is dp[0][n-1].

dp[i][j] should represent the sum of products of labels on paths from node i to k and then from k+1 to j, where k is a variable that will be determined in the state transition.

Tabulation with dynamic programming, initializing a 2D table of size (n+1) x (n+1) and filling it up in a top-to-bottom manner, using a nested loop structure to iterate over all nodes and edges:

    for i from n-1 down to 0:
        for j from i+1 down to n-1:
            // Transition state
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[u][v] + f(u,v)) for (u,v) in edges such that u < k and v > k
            // Base case
            if (i == j):
                dp[i][j] = f(i,i)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][k-1] * dp[k+1][j]) for k from i to j

    // The answer is the maximum value in the table.
    int ans = 0
    for i from n-1 down to 0:
        for j from i+1 down to n-1:
            ans = max(ans, dp[i][j])
