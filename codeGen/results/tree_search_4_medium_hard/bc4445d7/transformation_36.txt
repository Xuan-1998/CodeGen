===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on a bottom-up approach with tabulation by initializing a 3D table and filling it up in a bottom-to-top manner, exploiting the optimal substructure.

The state is defined as dp[u][v][k] = maximum sum of f(i,j) values over all pairs (i,j) where i is a node with at most u children, j is its child, and k is the number of edges labeled so far. The product of edge labels from nodes 1 to u should equal v.

dp[0][v][k] = -âˆž for any v and k

DP with memoization: Store intermediate results in a dictionary as you iterate through the nodes, and use these stored values to avoid recalculations when needed.

For each node i:
    For each child j of i:
        For each possible edge label e:
            Calculate f(i,j) = sum of edge labels from i to j
            Update dp[i][j][k] if necessary
    Update dp[i+1][v][k+1] if necessary

===END PLAN===
