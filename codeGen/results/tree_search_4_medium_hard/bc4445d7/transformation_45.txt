===BEGIN PLAN===
Let's break down our approach:

1.\*\*: Define memoization as it will help us avoid redundant computations and make the process more efficient.

2.\*\*: We can start with the base case where the tree only has 2 nodes. In this case, there is no distribution index because there are no edges to consider.

3.\*\*: Now we need to define a recursive relationship between subproblems. The idea is that the distribution index of a tree with n nodes is equal to the sum of the distribution indices of all subtrees rooted at each node (excluding the node itself). This will help us split the problem into smaller subproblems and solve them recursively.

4.\*\*: We can use dynamic programming to store the results of our recursive function calls in order to avoid redundant computations. This is where memoization comes into play, allowing us to store the results of our function calls and recall them if we encounter the same situation again.

5.\*\*: Finally, we need to consider edge cases, such as when the tree only has 2 nodes or more than one prime factor in the product of k. In this case, we can adjust our approach accordingly.
