===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoization for a dynamic programming solution where you maintain an array to store previously computed values, allowing you to avoid redundant computation.

The state expression is dp[u][v][k] = 1 if there exists a simple path from node u to node v with label k, otherwise 0. This state represents whether the edge (u, v) has label k or not.

To design the dynamic programming approach, consider the following recursive functions:

- Let f(u, v, k) be the function that returns the maximum possible distribution index of the tree considering nodes u and v with a simple path having label k.
- Let g(u, v, k) be the function that returns 1 if there exists an edge between nodes u and v such that their labels add up to k, otherwise 0.

The dynamic programming approach can be designed as follows:

f(u, v, k) = 
    - If (u, v) is the last edge in the tree, then return g(u, v, k)
    - Otherwise, consider all edges (w, x) incident on node u.
    - For each such edge, recursively call f(w, x, k % label_of_edge) and add it to the current maximum distribution index.
    - Return the maximum of these values.

This approach can be optimized by maintaining a memoization table dp[u][v][k] where dp[u][v][k] = f(u, v, k).

The plan is correct in terms of considering dynamic programming. However, there are some issues:

- The state expression is not clearly defined.
- The recursive functions need to consider the edge labels and not just the nodes.
- The approach does not handle the case where m prime factors are given and k = p1 * p2 * ... * pm.

To improve this plan:
- Define the state expression clearly.
- Modify the recursive function g(u, v, k) to return 1 if there exists an edge between nodes u and v such that their labels add up to k, otherwise 0.
- Handle the case where m prime factors are given and k = p1 * p2 * ... * pm.

The plan includes some edge cases but not all. For example, it does not handle the case where there is only one node in the tree.
