===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on a bottom-up approach with tabulation by initializing a 2D table and filling it up in a bottom-to-top manner, exploiting the optimal substructure.

The state is defined as dp[i][j] = minimum possible number of ones in the labels for nodes i to j, considering all edges between them.
dp[i][j] should represent the sum of products of labels on paths from node i to k and then from k+1 to j, where k is a variable that will be determined in the state transition

Dynamic programming with a 2D table, filling it up in a bottom-to-top manner, using a nested loop structure to iterate over all nodes and edges.

For each edge (u, v), update dp[u][v] by considering two possibilities:
1. Assign 0 as the label for node u.
2. Assign 1 as the label for node u.

Update the minimum possible number of ones in labels from i to j accordingly.

Use a memoization technique to store and reuse previously computed values in the table, reducing redundant computations.

Iterate over all nodes and edges to fill up the table.

For the maximum possible distribution index calculation, iterate over all nodes and edges, summing up products of labels on paths.
