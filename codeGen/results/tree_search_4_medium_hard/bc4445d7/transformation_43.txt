===BEGIN PLAN===
Decide on a bottom-up approach with tabulation by initializing a 2D table and filling it up in a bottom-to-top manner, exploiting the optimal substructure.

state is an integer that represents the maximum possible distribution index for each node, initialized to 0; state transitions happen when processing edges between nodes, updating the maximum possible distribution index accordingly;

Initialize a 2D table dp[node_size + 1][max_prime_factor + 1] with all values as 0;
Set base case: for any leaf node (i.e., no children), there is only one way to distribute ones among its edges, so set state for that node to 1.

For each edge between node u and node v:

    Calculate the maximum possible distribution index by considering the number of prime factors in k; 
    Update dp[u][number_of_prime_factors] with the maximum value;
    For each child node w of node u:
        Recursively update state for node w based on the maximum possible distribution index from node u to node w;
        Add the updated state for node w to the total maximum possible distribution index for node u;

Return dp[0][number_of_prime_factors] as the maximum possible distribution index for the entire tree.
