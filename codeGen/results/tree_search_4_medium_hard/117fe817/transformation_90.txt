===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up approach with Dynamic Programming to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

View the problem as counting the number of times '1' appears in all numbers that can be represented by 'n' bits, considering the case where n is very large and may not fit into a single integer variable.

Create a Dynamic Programming function dp[i] to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to i.
Iterate from i = 0 to n:
    For each j such that (i + 1) / 2 <= j < i, 
        Add j and its complement (i - j) to dp[i] based on whether the last bit is '1' or '0'.
    If i is odd, add i to dp[i].
Return dp[n].
