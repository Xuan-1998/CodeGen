===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a top-down approach with memoization to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

View the problem as counting the number of times '1' appears in all numbers that can be represented by 'n' bits, considering the case where n is very large and may not fit into a single integer variable.

Determine the maximum power of 2 that divides n. This is because each power of 2 corresponds to a unique set of binary digits (0s and 1s) in all numbers less than or equal to n.

Use memoization to count the number of times '1' appears in all numbers less than or equal to n, considering the case where n is very large. This can be done by recursively counting the number of times '1' appears in all numbers with 'n-1' bits and then adjusting this count based on the maximum power of 2 that divides n.

The recursive function should take two parameters: the current value of n and a memoization dictionary to store intermediate results. The base case for the recursion is when n equals 0, in which case there are no more numbers to consider.
