===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into counting the number of 1's in each digit position from 0 to n.
Let's initialize an array dp with size equal to the number of digits in n plus one, where dp[i] stores the count of ones in all numbers up to 10^i.

We'll then iterate over each digit position i. For each i, we can calculate the number of ones in all numbers up to 10^i as follows:

1. Calculate the number of ones in all numbers from 0 to 9 that end with the current digit i (this will be 1 * (10^(i-1))).
2. Add this value to the count of ones in all numbers up to 10^(i-1) (this is stored in dp[i-1]).
3. Subtract the number of ones in all numbers from 0 to 9 that have i digits but end with a zero (this will be 1 * 10^(i-1)).

Finally, we can sum up these counts to get the total count of ones in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.
