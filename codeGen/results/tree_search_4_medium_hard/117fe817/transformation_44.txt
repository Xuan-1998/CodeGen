===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computation.

Define dp[i] to represent the number of times 1 appears in all non-negative integers less than i. The base case is when i = 0, since there are no integers.

dp[i] represents the cumulative sum of 1s up to i. Transition relationship: dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (i >= 10 ? int(str(i)[0]) : 0), where str(i) converts integer i into string, [0] gets the first character which is either '1' or a non-digit character.

Use dynamic programming to build an array dp where dp[i] is the total count of digit 1 in numbers less than or equal to i.

The plan looks correct. To improve it, we can use memoization instead of explicit recursion to optimize the computation.

One potential issue with the plan is that it doesn't handle edge cases. For example, what if n is 0? In this case, there are no integers less than or equal to n, so the function should return 0. Similarly, what if n is a power of 10 (like 100 or 1000)? We would need to handle these special cases.

To include edge cases, we can modify the plan as follows:
