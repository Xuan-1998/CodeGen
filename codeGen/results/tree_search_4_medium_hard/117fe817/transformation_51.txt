===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a dynamic programming approach with memoization to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

For each integer i from 0 to n, consider it as a binary number and count the number of '1's in its representation. This can be done by using the formula: (i / 2) + (i % 2)
Memoize the function that counts the number of '1's in the binary representation of an integer.

Use the memoized function to calculate the total count for each integer from 0 to n, and then sum up all the counts.
The base case is when i = 0, in which case there are no '1's. The recursive relation is: dp[i] = (i / 2) + (i % 2) + dp[i - 1]
To avoid redundant calculations, use a bottom-up approach instead of top-down.
