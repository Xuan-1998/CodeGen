===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Represent the state as dp[i], which is the total count of 1's for each integer i from 0 to n. Formulate a recurrence relation based on this state:

dp[i] = (i // 10) * dp[i - 9] + (i % 10 == 1)

Create a list dp where dp[i] represents the count of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to i. Initialize dp[0] as 0.

Fill up the dp array using the recurrence relation from i = 1 to n.

The final answer is the sum of dp[i] for i from 0 to n.
