===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into counting the number of 1's in each digit position from 0 to n, then summing up these counts.
The state expression could be the total count of ones in all numbers less than or equal to n, i.e., dp represents the total count of ones.

The recurrence relation for dp[i] is dp[i] = dp[i // 10] + (i % 10 == 1) because if i contains a 1 at any position, it contributes to the count.
Base case: dp[0] = 0 since there are no numbers less than or equal to 0.

The plan can be improved by considering edge cases. For example, we should check if n is greater than 10^9 to handle the constraint. If true, return a message saying "n is too large".

This plan does not include edge case for negative numbers. However, since the problem statement says non-negative integers, this edge case can be ignored.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
