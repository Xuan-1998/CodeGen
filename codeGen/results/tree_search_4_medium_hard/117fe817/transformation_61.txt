===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Let dp[i] be the count of digit 1's up to the i-th integer. Initialize the base case: dp[0] = 0, since there are no digits in the 0-th integer.

Then, calculate the total number of times 1 appears in all integers that end with the state i (i.e., the last digit is i). This can be done by considering two cases:
    - If i is 0, then the integers ending with 0 do not have a trailing 1. So, dp[i] = dp[i-1].
    - If i is 1, then the integers ending with 1 always have a trailing 1. So, dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1.

Update the table accordingly:
    - For each integer k from 1 to n (inclusive):
        - Calculate the last digit of k as i.
        - Update dp[k] using the recurrence relation above.
    - Return the final value of dp[n] as the total count of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

This plan takes into account edge cases, such as n = 0 and n = 1. It also avoids counting the same integer multiple times by considering only the last digit of each integer.
