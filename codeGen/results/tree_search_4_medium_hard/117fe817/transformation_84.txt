===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.
\
Let dp[i] be the number of times the digit 1 appears in all non-negative integers less than or equal to i.
The transition relationship is that dp[j+1] = dp[j] + (j+1 >= 10 ? 1 : int(str(j+1).count('1'))) where str(j+1).count('1') counts the number of 1's in the integer j+1.
Start from dp[0] and iterate up to n, updating dp[i] at each step. 
The final result is dp[n].
Apply the concept of memoization by using a dictionary to store the results of expensive function calls, but this approach might not be necessary as we are iterating through integers in order.
