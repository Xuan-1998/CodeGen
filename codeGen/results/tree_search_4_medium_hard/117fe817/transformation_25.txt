===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into counting the number of 1's in each digit position from 0 to n, then summing up these counts.
The state expression could be the count of ones in each number from 0 to n, and base case would be considering only single-digit numbers.
The transition relationship could be that the total count of ones in each digit position is the sum of the counts for the previous lower digit positions (i.e., the remaining digits from 1 to 9).
Create a table where each row represents a digit position and each column represents a number from 0 to n, with the cell value being the count of ones in that digit position for that number.
The total count would be the sum of all counts along the last row of the table (representing the count of ones up to n).
To optimize, we can precalculate the base case and store it as a 2D array. Then, iterate through each digit position from left to right, updating the current row based on the previous row.
Finally, return the sum of all counts along the last row.
