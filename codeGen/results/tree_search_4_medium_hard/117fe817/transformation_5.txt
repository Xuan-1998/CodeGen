===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into counting the number of 1's in each digit position from 0 to n, then summing up these counts.
The state expression could be the total count of ones in all numbers less than or equal to n, i.e., dp represents the total count of ones.
Using a variable for each digit position from 0 to n, update dp by adding the count of ones in each digit position.
For example, let's say we're considering the number of ones in the units place. For all numbers less than or equal to n, the number of ones in the units place is either 1 (for numbers ending with 1) or 0 (for numbers not ending with 1). So, the total count of ones in the units place is simply the number of multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to n.
Similarly, for each digit position from 0 to n, update dp by adding the count of ones in that position. This way, we'll have an accurate count of the total number of ones in all numbers less than or equal to n.
Finally, return the value of dp as the answer.
