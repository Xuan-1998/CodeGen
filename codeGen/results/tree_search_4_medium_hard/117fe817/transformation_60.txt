===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Represent the state as an integer dp[i], which represents the total count of 1's for each integer i from 0 to n. Formulate a recurrence relation based on this state: dp[i] = dp[i // 10] + (i % 10 == 1).

Use a list comprehension to create a list dp of integers, where each integer in the list represents the total count of digit 1's for each integer i from 0 to n.

Initialize dp[0] as 0. Then, iterate over all integers i from 1 to n and update dp[i] based on the recurrence relation.

Finally, return the last element of the list dp, which is the total number of times the digit 1 appears in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.
