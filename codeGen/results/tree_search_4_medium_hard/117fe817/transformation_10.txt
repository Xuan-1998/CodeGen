===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into counting the number of 1's in each digit position from 0 to n, then summing up these counts.
The state expression could be the total count of ones in all numbers less than or equal to n up to the current digit position i, i.e., dp[i] represents the sum of ones in all numbers from 0 to i.

For each digit position i from 1 to log(n), calculate the number of 1's that appear at this position and add it to the previous state (dp[i-1]) to get dp[i]. This is because for a given digit position, there are 10^(i-1) numbers that have a 1 at this position, and these numbers contribute 1 to the total count of ones.

Finally, sum up all dp[i] from i = 1 to log(n) to get the total number of times the digit 1 appears in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

This plan ensures that it counts each 1 exactly once and takes into account the fact that there are more numbers with a 1 at lower digit positions, which is important for this problem.
