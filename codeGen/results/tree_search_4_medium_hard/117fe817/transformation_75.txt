===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up approach with tabulation to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Let dp[i] be the count of '1's in all integers from 0 to i-1. We can calculate dp[i] as follows:

dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (i/10) * 1 + (i%10 < 1)

Here, the first term represents the carry-over from the previous integer. The second term represents the number of '1's in all multiples of 10 less than or equal to i (since there are i/10 such multiples). The third term represents the additional '1' if the last digit of i is 1.

Develop a solution based on this recurrence relation and use it to calculate dp[n].
