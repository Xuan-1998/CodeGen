===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into counting the number of 1's in each digit position from 0 to n, then summing up these counts.

The state expression could be the number of ones in each digit position from 0 to n, i.e., dp[i] represents the count of ones in all numbers up to i.

Consider a recursive function where f(i) is the number of ones in all numbers from 0 to i. The transition relationship would be dp[i] = sum(f(j) for j in range(i+1)).

Initialize the table with base cases: dp[0] = 1 (since there's one 1 in all numbers up to 0), and then use bottom-up dynamic programming to iteratively update the state based on previously computed values:

dp[i] = sum(dp[j] for j in range(i+1))

This approach correctly handles edge cases, such as n being 0 or negative (by returning 0).

Finally, sum up all the counts from dp[0] to dp[n] to get the total count of ones in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.
