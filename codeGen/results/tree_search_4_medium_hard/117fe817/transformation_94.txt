===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.
Determine a recursive function to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n, with base cases for when n is small.
Build up a table dp[k] where dp[k] represents the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to k. Start from k = 0 and iterate up to n.
For each k, calculate dp[k] as the sum of:
- The total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to k - 1 (dp[k - 1])
- The count of 1's that appear at the units place of all integers from 0 to k
Use this table to compute the solution for n.
