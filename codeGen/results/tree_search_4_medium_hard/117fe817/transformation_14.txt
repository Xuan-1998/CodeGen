===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into counting the number of 1's in each digit position from 0 to n, then summing up these counts.

Let dp[i] represent the total count of ones in all numbers less than or equal to n up to the current digit position i. We can update dp[i] by iterating over all numbers from 0 to n and counting the number of times 1 appears at the ith position.

To do this, we can use a list comprehension with a conditional statement to count the number of ones in all numbers less than or equal to n up to the current digit position i. The correct condition would be to check if the ith digit is 1, and add it to the total count if true.

We can further optimize the plan by only iterating over the numbers from 0 to n once for each digit position, rather than for every single number. This would significantly reduce the time complexity of our solution.
