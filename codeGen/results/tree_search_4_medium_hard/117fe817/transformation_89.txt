===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming and memoization to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Consider each integer from 0 to n as a binary representation, with the most significant bit representing the number itself. The problem becomes one of counting the total number of times the digit 1 appears in all possible binary representations.

Define a function dp(i) that returns the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to i. Use memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computation.

Initialize the base case: dp(0) = 0, since there are no digits in the binary representation of 0.

For each integer i from 1 to n:
    If i is even, then all its digits (except possibly the most significant bit) are 0's. So, the number of digit 1's in i is the same as in i/2.
    If i is odd, then there is one extra 1 added to the binary representation of i/2. Add this to the result.

Memoize the results and return dp(n).
