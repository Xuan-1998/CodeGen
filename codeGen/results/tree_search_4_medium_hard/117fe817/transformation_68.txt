===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Let dp[i] be the number of times digit 1 appears in all non-negative integers less than i. 

Create an array dp[10] where dp[i] represents the number of times digit 1 appears in all non-negative integers less than i. 

For each integer j from 0 to n, 
- If j is divisible by 2 and (j+1) is not, then we can count the number of times digit 1 appears in all multiples of 2 ending with 1 less than or equal to j. This gives us dp[j]. 
- If j is divisible by 4 and (j+1) is not, then we can count the number of times digit 1 appears in all multiples of 4 ending with 1 less than or equal to j. This gives us 2 * dp[j / 4].
- If j is divisible by 8 and (j+1) is not, then we can count the number of times digit 1 appears in all multiples of 8 ending with 1 less than or equal to j. This gives us 3 * dp[j / 8].

Finally, add up all these counts from 0 to n.

The time complexity of this plan is O(n log log n) and space complexity is O(log n).
