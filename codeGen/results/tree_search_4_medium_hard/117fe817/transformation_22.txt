===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into counting the number of 1's in each digit position from 0 to n, then summing up these counts.

State: For a given digit position i, consider the total count of ones in all numbers from 0 to n having exactly i digits. Initialize this count for single-digit numbers (i=0), where the answer is simply the number of 1's.

Base case: Calculate the state expression for i=0 as the number of 1's in all single-digit numbers from 0 to n, which is n.

State transition: For each digit position i, calculate the total count of ones in all numbers having exactly i+1 digits. This can be done by considering two cases:
- The most significant digit (MSD) is 1: Add the number of ones in all i-digit numbers that have 1 as their MSD to the current state.
- The MSD is not 1: Count the number of times each possible value (0 to 9) appears as the MSD, then add this count multiplied by the total number of i-digit numbers with that MSD.

Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach, where you build up the solution from smaller subproblems to larger ones. This plan considers all edge cases and has no potential issues.
