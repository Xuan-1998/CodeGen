===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into counting the number of 1's in each digit position from 0 to n, then summing up these counts.

The state expression could be the count of ones in each number from 0 to n, and base case would be considering only single-digit numbers.

State: For a given digit position i, consider the total count of ones in all numbers from 0 to n having exactly i digits.
Use a dictionary memo to store the intermediate results for memoization.

Base Case:
- Single-digit numbers have at most one '1', so we can directly calculate this.

Recursive Case:
- Consider the total count of ones in all numbers from 0 to n having exactly i+1 digits. 
- This is equal to the sum of the count of ones in all numbers from 0 to n having exactly i digits and the count of ones in all single-digit numbers (since these are all less than n).

Memoization:
- Store the intermediate results for each digit position i, so we don't have to recalculate this.

The final answer will be the sum of the counts of ones in each digit position from 0 to n.
