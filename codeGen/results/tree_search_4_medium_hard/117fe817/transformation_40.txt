===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computation.

Define dp[i] to represent the number of times 1 appears in all non-negative integers less than i. The base case is when i = 0, since there are no integers.

dp[i] represents the number of times 1 appears in all non-negative integers less than i. Transition relationship: dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + sum(1 appears in each integer from i-1 to i), where sum is calculated based on the binary representation of numbers. Since there are at most log(i) bits in the binary representation, we only need to consider up to log(i) iterations.

To make the plan more efficient and accurate, you can use memoization by defining a function f(i) that returns the total count of digit 1's up to i, and then use this function as a recurrence relation for calculating dp[i].

The base case is still when i = 0. For other values of i, we have: f(i) = f(floor(i/2)) + (i % 2 == 1).

This plan considers all edge cases such as i = 0 and ensures the accuracy by using memoization.
