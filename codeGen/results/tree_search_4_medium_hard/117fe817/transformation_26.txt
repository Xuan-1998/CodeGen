===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into counting the number of 1's in each digit position from 0 to n, then summing up these counts.
The state expression could be the count of ones in each number from 0 to n, and base case would be considering only single-digit numbers.
The transition relationship could be that the total count of ones in each digit position is the sum of the counts for the previous lower digit positions (i.e., the remaining digits from 1 to 9).
The plan can be improved by initializing a dictionary with default values for each digit position, and then updating these values as we iterate through the problem.
To handle edge cases, make sure that the base case is properly handled. In this case, since single-digit numbers have only one digit, the count of ones in each digit position would be 0 or 1 (depending on whether the number contains a 1).
Here's an updated version of the plan:
