===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into counting the number of 1's in each digit position from 0 to n, then summing up these counts.

The state expression could be the total count of ones in all numbers less than or equal to n up to the current digit position i, i.e., dp[i] represents the sum of ones in all numbers from 0 to i.

dp[i] is the total count of ones in all numbers less than or equal to n up to the current digit position i, and we can update dp[i] by iterating over all numbers from 0 to n and counting the number of times 1 appears at the ith position. We can iterate over the last significant bit (LSB) first, as this would give us the most significant contribution to the total count.

To improve the plan, we could consider using a prefix sum approach to reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n), where n is the number of digits in the given integer. This would be especially useful for large inputs.

The current plan does not include edge cases, so we should ensure that it handles the case when n is 0 correctly.
