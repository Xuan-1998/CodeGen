===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into counting the number of 1's in each digit position from 0 to n, then summing up these counts.

The state expression could be the total count of ones in all numbers less than or equal to n up to the current digit position i, i.e., dp[i] represents the sum of ones in all numbers from 0 to i.

To calculate dp[i], we need to consider the number of ones at each position for integers from 0 to n. We can do this by considering the contribution of each integer less than or equal to n that has a 1 at the current digit position. This is equivalent to counting the number of multiples of 10^i less than or equal to n.

To count these multiples, we can use the fact that the number of multiples of 10^i less than or equal to n is equivalent to n // (10^i). We then add this contribution to the previous state dp[i-1] to get dp[i].

We can fold the counting process into a recursive function that uses memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant computation. This will reduce the time complexity of our solution.
