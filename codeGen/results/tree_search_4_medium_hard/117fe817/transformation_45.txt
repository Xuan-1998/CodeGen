===BEGIN PLAN===
Define dp[i] to represent the number of times 1 appears in all non-negative integers less than i.
The base case is when i = 0, since there are no integers.
dp[i] represents the cumulative sum of 1s up to i.
Transition relationship: 
    if i < 10:
        dp[i] = 0
    else:
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (int(str(i)[0]) == 1)
Build an array with memoization to store the cumulative counts of digit 1, starting from i = 1.
dp[0] is unnecessary, so initialize it to any value.
The final answer will be dp[n].
