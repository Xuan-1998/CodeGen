===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computation.

The state can be defined as dp[k][n], where k is the digit place (0-indexed) and n is the integer value. The base case is when n < 10^(k-1), since all integers less than that do not have a kth digit.

dp[k][n] = sum(dp[k-1][i]) for i from int(str(n)[:k])-1 to str(n)[:k]+1) + (str(n)[k] == '1')

Implement top-down memoization using a recursive function with caching and handle the edge case where n is 0.

This plan correctly captures the essence of dynamic programming, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, and storing results to avoid redundant computation. It also addresses the edge cases.

The only potential issue is that it may not be efficient for large inputs since it needs to sum up all previous values. However, this can be improved by using a bottom-up approach with iterative dynamic programming.
