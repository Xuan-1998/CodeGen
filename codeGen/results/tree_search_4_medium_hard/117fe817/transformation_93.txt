===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Determine an iterative function to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n, with a base case for when n is small.
Initialize a table dp of size n+1, where dp[i] represents the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to i.

Iterate over the range [0, n], and for each i, calculate dp[i] as follows:
- If i is a single-digit integer (i.e., i < 10), then dp[i] = i.
- Otherwise, if i has two digits (i.e., i >= 10), then dp[i] = dp[i // 10] + i % 10.

Finally, return the total count of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n as the sum of the elements in the dp array.
