===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into counting the number of 1's in each digit position from 0 to n, then summing up these counts.

State: For a given digit position i, consider the total count of ones in all numbers from 0 to n having exactly i digits.
Consider a 1D array dp where dp[i] represents the total count of ones in all numbers from 0 to n having exactly i digits.
The base case is considering only single-digit numbers.

For each digit position i, calculate the number of 1's in all numbers from 10^(i-1) to 2*10^(i-1)-1 (since these are the numbers that have exactly i digits).
This can be calculated by summing up the number of 1's in each possible value for the most significant digit, and then multiplying this sum by 10^(i-1).

Finally, sum up all the counts of ones from each digit position to get the total count of ones.
