===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into counting the number of 1's in each digit position from 0 to n, then summing up these counts.

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let dp[i] be the total count of ones in all numbers less than or equal to n up to the current digit position i.
To calculate dp[i], we iterate over all numbers from 0 to n and count the number of times 1 appears at the ith position.

We can use a dictionary to store the intermediate results and calculate the counts for each digit position.

The state transition equation is: dp[i] = (n // 10**i) * (1 + dp[i-1]) if i > 0, otherwise dp[0] = count_ones(n)

The base case is when i = 0, where we just need to calculate the number of ones in n.

The final answer is the sum of all dp[i].

This plan correctly captures the essence of the problem and can be implemented using dynamic programming.
