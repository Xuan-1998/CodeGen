===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into counting the number of 1's in each digit position from 0 to n, then summing up these counts.
Let dp[i] represent the count of ones in all numbers up to i.
Let dp represent the total count of ones in all numbers less than or equal to n.

The state transition could be: 
dp = sum(dp[j] * (10**(len(str(n))-j-1)) for j in range(len(str(n))))

This is because every number from 0 to n has a unique representation in base 10. The total count of ones in all numbers less than or equal to n can be calculated by considering each digit position separately.

For example, the number 101 has one 1 in its tens place and two 1's in its ones place. So, the total count of ones is dp[0] + dp[2].

The initial state could be: 
dp = [0 for _ in range(len(str(n)))] 

Since there are no ones in any number less than or equal to n, the total count of ones is initially 0.

The base case could be: 
n == 0, return 0

This is because there are no ones in any number less than or equal to 0. So, the total count of ones is 0.

The solution would be: 
def countOnes(n):
    dp = [0 for _ in range(len(str(n))))]
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    for i in range(1, len(str(n))):
        for j in range(i+1):
            if (j + 1) * 10**(i-1) <= n:
                dp[i] += 1
            else:
                break
    totalOnes = sum(dp[j] * (10**(len(str(n))-j-1)) for j in range(len(str(n))))
    return totalOnes
