===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Formulate a state that represents the total number of ones in all integers up to i. The transition occurs when you increment the most significant bit (MSB) from 0 to 1.
Create a 1D array dp[i] that stores the total number of ones in all integers up to i.

Transition from dp[i-1] to dp[i] by adding the number of ones in the MSB positions for all numbers from i-1 to n. This is because when you increment the MSB, you are essentially counting the number of ones in that position for all numbers up to n.
The base case is when i is 0, and there are no ones.

Fill in the dp array by iterating from 1 to n, and use the transition function to fill in each entry.
The final answer is stored in dp[n].
