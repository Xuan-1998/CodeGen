===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with memoization to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Consider the last digit of each integer as the state, where the state is either 0 (not ending with 1) or 1 (ending with 1). Then:
    * For state 0: Count the total number of times 1 appears in all integers that do not end with 1. This can be calculated by summing up the counts for all states except 1.
    * For state 1: Count the total number of times 1 appears in all integers that end with 1, including n if it ends with 1. This is calculated by adding 1 to the count for the previous state (since n will also contribute a 1), plus the count for all states except 0.

Use a dictionary to store the counts for each state and look up the values as needed during computation.

The plan can be improved by:
    * Handling edge cases: What if n is 0? It doesn't end with 1, so its count should be 0.
    * Starting from base case: Counting the number of times 1 appears in single-digit numbers and memoizing the result. This will help avoid recalculating the same counts multiple times.

The plan does include edge cases for n = 0 and for calculating the counts for each state. It also accounts for the fact that a given integer can end with either 0 or 1.
