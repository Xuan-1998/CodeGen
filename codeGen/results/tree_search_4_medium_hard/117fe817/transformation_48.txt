===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Create an array dp of size n+1, where dp[i] represents the total number of '1's in all numbers less than or equal to i.
\

For each integer i from 0 to n:
    For each base-10 representation j of i (j >= 0):
        If the most significant digit (MSD) is 1:
            Add 1 to dp[i]
        If MSD is not 1, consider the next less significant digit
    Calculate the total number of '1's in numbers less than or equal to n by summing up all values in dp
