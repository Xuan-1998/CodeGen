===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a dynamic programming approach with memoization to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Consider the number of times '1' appears as a leading digit (0 or more times). For each leading '1', consider all possible trailing digits from 0 to n-1, and count how many of them are also '1'.

Initialize a dynamic programming table dp with size n+1, where dp[i] stores the number of digit 1's in integers less than i.

For each i from 0 to n:
    If i is 0, set dp[0] = 0
    Otherwise:
        For each leading '1' in i:
            Calculate the number of trailing digits that are also '1'
            Add this count to dp[i]

The final answer is the sum of all values in dp
