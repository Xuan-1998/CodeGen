===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.
\
Create a table dp of size (n+1) where dp[i] represents the number of times the digit 1 appears in all non-negative integers less than i.
\ Initialize the base case: dp[0] = 0
\ Define the transition relationship: for each integer i, consider the last digit. If it's 1, add 1 to the count for the previous integer (i-1) and add that result to the current count; otherwise, just copy the count from the previous integer.
\ Fill up the table dp iteratively from left to right.
\
Create a function to calculate the total count: return dp[n]
