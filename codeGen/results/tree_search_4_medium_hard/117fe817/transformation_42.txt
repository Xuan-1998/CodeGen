===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computation.

Define dp[i] to represent the number of times 1 appears in all non-negative integers less than i. The base case is when i = 0, since there are no integers.

Consider a binary representation of integers, where every '1' bit contributes one occurrence of digit 1. dp[i] represents the number of '1' bits less than or equal to i's binary representation.

Transition relationship: dp[i] = dp[floor(i / 2)] + count('1' in i's binary representation).

Consider handling edge cases, such as when n is 0. In this case, return 0.

Transition relationship can be simplified by removing the floor function and just using integer division since it doesn't affect the result.

The plan seems correct, but to further improve it, consider memoizing the count('1' in i's binary representation) operation to avoid redundant computation within the dynamic programming loop.
