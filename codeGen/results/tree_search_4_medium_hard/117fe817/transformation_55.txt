===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Consider the state as the last digit of an integer and formulate a recurrence relation based on this state. Let dp[i] be the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to i.

The recurrence relation can be formulated as:
dp[i] = sum of 1's in all integers from 0 to i-1 that end with digit 'i' (the last digit) + dp[i-1]

This is because the total number of 1's in integers ending with the current digit 'i' is independent of the previous digits and can be summed up separately.

Initialize the base case as dp[0] = 0, since there are no integers less than or equal to 0 that end with digit '0'.

The dynamic programming approach ensures that each subproblem (the count of 1's in a specific range) is solved only once and its solution is stored for future reference.

Finally, return the total count of 1's as dp[n].
