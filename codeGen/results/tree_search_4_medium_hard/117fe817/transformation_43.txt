===BEGIN PLAN===
Define dp[i] to represent the number of times 1 appears in all non-negative integers less than i.
The base case is when i = 0, since there are no integers. 
dp[0] = 0
For i > 0:
    If i < 10, then the count of digit 1 is simply i (since each single-digit number has a '1' in it)
    dp[i] = i

    Else if i >= 10:
        Count the number of times '1' appears at the beginning of all numbers from i-9 to i (exclusive) 
        and add that to i. This represents the count of digit 1 in all multi-digit numbers less than or equal to i
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + i

The final answer is the cumulative sum of 1s up to n, which can be calculated by adding up all values in the dp array from 0 to n.
