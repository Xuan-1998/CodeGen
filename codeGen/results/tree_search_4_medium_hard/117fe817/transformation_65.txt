===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a dynamic programming approach with memoization to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

The state can be the count of digit 1's up to an integer. For example, if we are considering numbers up to 10, then the counts would be [0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]. The transition relationship is that adding k to an integer either increases or decreases the count of digit 1's. This can be calculated based on the count of digit 1's in the previous numbers.

Design a recursive function to calculate the count of digit 1's for each number up to n, and then implement memoization to avoid repeated calculations.

To improve this plan, we can further break down the state into sub-states by considering only the last digit of an integer. This would significantly reduce the number of states needed to be stored in the memoization table.
