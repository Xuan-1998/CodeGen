===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a top-down approach with memoization to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Consider the number of times '1' appears as an intermediate digit (not leading or not trailing). For each position in which '1' can appear, count how many integers less than or equal to n contain it.
Let dp[i][j] be the number of integers less than or equal to i that have j 1's.

The base case is when i = 0, there are no integers, so dp[0][j] = 0 for all j.

For each i > 0:
    For each j from 0 to min(i, 9) (since the maximum number of 1's in an integer less than or equal to n is 9):
        If j == 0, count the numbers less than or equal to i that start with '1' and recursively call dp[i - 1][j + 1] to count the remaining 1's.
        Else, add the number of integers less than or equal to (i - 10^k) that have j - 1 1's (where k is the number of times 10 can be subtracted from i without exceeding it) and recursively call dp[i - 10^k][j - 1] to count the remaining 1's.
    Add up all the counts for each j.

The total count is the sum of all dp[i][j].
