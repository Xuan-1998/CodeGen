===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into counting the number of 1's in each digit position from 0 to n, then summing up these counts.
The state expression could be dp[i], which represents the count of ones in all numbers with i digits from 0 to (10^i - 1).
The base case would be considering only single-digit numbers, where dp[1] = count of ones in [0, 9].
The transition relationship could be that for each additional digit added to an existing number, the total count of ones would increase by the number of ones in the next available digit (i.e., the remaining digits from 1 to 9).
Counting the number of 1's in each digit position as a separate dynamic programming table.
For example, for two-digit numbers [10, 99], we add the count of ones in single-digit numbers [0, 9] to the count of ones in one-digit numbers [1, 9].
Similarly, for three-digit numbers [100, 999], we add the count of ones in two-digit numbers [10, 99] to the count of ones in two-digit numbers [01, 19] and single-digit number [1].
This process can be repeated until we reach n.
Finally, sum up the counts in all dynamic programming tables to get the total count of ones in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.
