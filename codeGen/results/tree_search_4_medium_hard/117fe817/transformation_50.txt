===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a bottom-up approach with tabulation to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Let dp[i] be the number of '1's in the binary representation of integers from 0 to i. Then, dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (i & 1), because the last bit of i determines whether there is a '1' at the end of its binary representation.

So, initialize an array dp with n+1 elements and set dp[0] to 0. Then, for each integer i from 1 to n, update dp[i] as follows:

dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (i & 1)

The total number of digit '1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n is the sum of all elements in dp: sum(dp).

This plan correctly solves the problem.
