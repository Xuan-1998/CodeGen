Use a top-down approach with memoization to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Think about counting the number of 1's in each range [i, j], where i and j are consecutive integers. The state is the range [i, j] and the transition relationship is that the total count for [j+1, k] is the same as the total count for [i, j] plus the count of 1's in the integer j.

Define a recursive function dp(i, j) that returns the total count of 1's in all integers from i to j (inclusive). 

The base case is when i = j, which means there is only one integer and we can easily calculate the number of 1's in it. 

For the recursive case, use memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computation.
