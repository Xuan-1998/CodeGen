===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a dynamic programming approach with memoization to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Consider the property that all non-negative integers less than or equal to n can be represented as sum of powers of 10. Use this property to formulate a recursive relationship with respect to the power of 10.
Use memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computation.
Recursively count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.
At each step, consider the last digit of the integer. If it is 1, add the number of ones at this position to the total count. 
Then, recursively call the function for the remaining digits.

Use a bottom-up approach by initializing an array dp with size n+1 where dp[i] represents the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to i.
Fill up the dp array using the recursive relationship and memoization.
Finally, return the value at index n from the dp array.
