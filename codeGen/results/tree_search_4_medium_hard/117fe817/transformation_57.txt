===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a dynamic programming approach with memoization to count the total number of digit 1's in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

Formulate a state that represents the total number of ones in all integers up to n, where the transition occurs when you increment the most significant bit (MSB), i.e., when the integer becomes two more significant than the previous one. This can be achieved by keeping track of the last MSB changed and the number of ones at that level.

Memoize the function f(n) that counts the total number of ones in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n, using a dictionary to store previously computed values.

Iterate over the range from 0 to n, updating the memoization dictionary as you go. For each integer k in this range, calculate the number of ones in the range [0, k] and update the total count accordingly.

Handle edge cases by initializing the memoization dictionary with base cases (e.g., f(0) = 0).
