===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use memoization to store and reuse solutions for overlapping subproblems, which would be rooms with already visited portals.

Define the state expression as dp[i]: number of ways to reach room i from room 1; dp[0] = 1, since Vasya can always exit the maze from room n+1.
dp[i]: minimum number of portal moves required to reach room i; dp[0] = 1, since Vasya starts at room 1.

Utilizing dynamic programming with bottom-up approach: initializing a list or array with dp[n+1] = 0 and then iteratively fill in the dp[i] values using the following recurrence:

dp[i] = 1 + min(dp[j] | p_j < i, j < i)

This plan is correct, but it can be improved by considering the parity of the number of crosses on the ceiling when choosing which portal to use. This information should be stored and used in the calculation.

The potential issue with this plan is that it might not handle edge cases correctly, such as when n = 1 or p_i < i - 1 for some i. However, these cases can be easily handled by adding simple base cases to the recurrence relation.

Here is an updated version of the plan:
