===BEGIN PLAN===
State: room, visited
Transition:
    - If visited and ceiling has odd number of crosses, next_room = p[room]
    - Else if not visited and room < n+1, next_room = room + 1
    - Else if not visited and room == n+1, next_room = room
    - Else, next_room = 0

Use a 2D table where each cell [i][j] represents whether it's possible to reach the jth room from the ith room.
