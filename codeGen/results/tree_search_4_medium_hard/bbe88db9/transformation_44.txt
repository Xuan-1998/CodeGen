===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use memoization to store and reuse solutions for overlapping subproblems, which would be rooms with already visited portals.

Define the state expression as dp[i]: number of ways to reach room i from room 1; dp[0] = n+1, since Vasya starts at room 1 and needs to get to room (n+1).

dp[i]: number of ways to reach room i with an odd number of crosses on the ceiling.

Use a dynamic programming table dp where dp[i] is the minimum number of steps required for Vasya to reach room i from room 1. The base case should be dp[0] = 0, since Vasya starts at room 1 and doesn't need any moves.

For each room i > 1, calculate dp[i] as follows:

* If the ceiling has an odd number of crosses, use the second portal (p[i-1]) and set dp[i] to be the minimum of:
	+ dp[p[i-1]] + 1
	+ dp[i-1]
* Otherwise, use the first portal and set dp[i] to be the minimum of:
	+ dp[i-1]
	+ dp[p[i-2]]
