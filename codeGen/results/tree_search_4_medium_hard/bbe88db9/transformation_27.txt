===BEGIN PLAN===
The transition relationship could be defined based on the portal rules: if the ceiling has an odd number of crosses, take the second portal; otherwise, take the first one. We can use this rule to define a recurrence relation that depends only on the current state.

The state expression could be a pair (i, x), where i is the room number and x is the number of crosses on the ceiling.

Transition: If crosses % 2 == 1, use second portal; otherwise, use first one. This rule determines the next room Vasya will be in based on the current room and the number of crosses on the ceiling.

Memoization using a dictionary to store previously computed values of (i, x) and retrieve them as needed, which allows us to avoid redundant computations.

Let's define a function dp(i, x) that returns the minimum number of portal moves needed to get from room 1 to room i with x crosses on the ceiling. We can then compute dp(n+1, 0), where n is the number of rooms, as the answer.

We can start by initializing dp(1, 0) = 0 (it takes no moves to reach room 1), and then fill in dp(i, x) values based on the transition rule. This would involve iterating over all possible values of i and x, and for each pair, computing the minimum number of moves needed to get from room 1 to room i with x crosses on the ceiling.

The final answer would be dp(n+1, 0), which is the minimum number of portal moves needed to get from room 1 to room n+1 with no crosses on the ceiling. 

This plan should work correctly and provide an efficient solution. However, we might need to add some checks for edge cases, such as when i > n+1 or x < 0.
