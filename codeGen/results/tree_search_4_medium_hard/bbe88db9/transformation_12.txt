===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem involves portals, we can define a state that captures the current room and whether it's been visited before. This will allow us to avoid revisiting rooms unnecessarily.

Define a state as a tuple of (room_number, portals_used, ceiling_painted) where:

- room_number is an integer representing the current room.
- portals_used is an integer representing the number of portals used to get to this room.
- ceiling_painted is a boolean indicating whether the ceiling has been painted in this room.

The state expression could be (room, portals) where room is the current room number and portals are two lists representing the one-way portals.

Dynamically build a memoization dictionary that maps each state (room, portals) to its corresponding minimum number of portal moves.

For each state, consider all possible next steps:

- If the ceiling has not been painted, consider both using the first and second portals.
- If the ceiling has been painted, always use the second portal.

Update the memoization dictionary with the minimum number of portal moves for each possible next step. 

Recursively build the memoization dictionary until you reach the final room (n+1). The minimum number of portal moves to get out of the maze is stored in the memoization dictionary for the initial state (room 1, portals [[1, p_1], [2, i-1]]).
