===BEGIN PLAN===
The transition relationship could be defined based on the portal rules: if the ceiling has an odd number of crosses, take the second portal; otherwise, take the first one. We can use this rule to define a recurrence relation that depends only on the current state.

Let's refine the state expression as follows:
dp[i][j][k] represents the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach room i with j crosses on the ceiling and k rooms left to traverse.

The transition relationship becomes: if there are j crosses on the ceiling, Vasya will use the second portal (p_i) if j is odd, or the first portal (i-1) if j is even. We also need to update k accordingly.

Memoization can be achieved by defining a function that takes i, j, and k as inputs, updating the memo dictionary accordingly, and finally returning memo[0][n+1].

The base case is dp[n+1][0][0], representing the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach the final room with no crosses on the ceiling.

We need to consider edge cases: what happens when Vasya reaches a room with an even/odd number of crosses and there are no more rooms left to traverse? We can handle this by setting dp[i][j][k] = 0 in these cases, as Vasya cannot move further.

Finally, we return memo[0][n+1], which represents the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach room n+1 with 0 crosses on the ceiling.
