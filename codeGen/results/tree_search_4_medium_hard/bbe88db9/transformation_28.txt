===BEGIN PLAN===
The transition relationship could be defined based on the portal rules: if the ceiling has an odd number of crosses, take the second portal; otherwise, take the first one. We can use this rule to define a recurrence relation that depends only on the current state.

The state expression could be a pair (i, x), where i is the room number and x is the number of crosses on the ceiling.

Transition:
  if crosses % 2 == 1:
    next_room = p[i]
    crosses += 1
  else:
    next_room = i + 1
    crosses = 0

Tabulation with a 1D array dp to store the minimum moves required for each room, based on the number of crosses.

Initialization: dp[0] = 0

Recurrence relation: dp[i] = min(dp[p[i-1]] if crosses % 2 == 1 else dp[i-1]) + 1

Final answer: dp[n]
