Plan:

Since we are dealing with portals and room numbers, our state can be represented as a tuple of (room, path).
The state expression could be (room, visited), where room is the current room number and visited is a boolean indicating whether the room has been visited before.
This representation allows us to track whether each room has been visited to avoid revisiting rooms unnecessarily.

DP state could be a 2D array with dimensions n+1 by some fixed constant, where each cell [i][j] represents the minimum number of portal moves required to get from room i to room j. 

For each cell in this DP table, we calculate its value based on values of previous cells and the current state.
This means that if we are in room i and have already painted a cross on its ceiling, we use the second portal (leading to room p_i) if and only if the ceiling contains an odd number of crosses, otherwise we use the first portal.

We start by initializing all values in our DP table as infinity. Then for each cell, we find the minimum number of steps required to get from room i to room j.
Finally, we return the value at [n+1][0], which represents the minimum number of steps Vasya needs to get out of the maze.

This plan does not include edge cases but can be improved by adding necessary checks and handling. The time complexity for this DP approach would be O(n^2), where n is the number of rooms, because we are filling a 2D table with size (n+1) x (n+1).
