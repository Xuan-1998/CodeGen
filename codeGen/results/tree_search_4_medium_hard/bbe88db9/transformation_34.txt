===BEGIN PLAN===
The transition relationship could be defined based on the portal rules: if the ceiling has an odd number of crosses, take the second portal; otherwise, take the first one. We can use this rule to define a recurrence relation that depends only on the current state.

Define the state as dp[i] = minimum portal moves to reach room i

dp[i] represents the number of times Vasya needs to use portals to reach room i. We can update dp[i] based on whether the ceiling has an odd or even number of crosses, which depends on p_{i-1}.

Let's denote dp[i-1]%2 as the parity of the number of crosses in room i-1. If this parity is 0 (even), then we take the first portal; if it's 1 (odd), then we take the second portal.

Update rule: dp[i] = min(dp[p_{i-1}], dp[i-1]%2 == 0 ? i - p_{i-1} : i - p_{i-1} - 1) + 1

Implement memoization using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems.

Initialize the dp array with all values set to infinity.

For each room i, update dp[i] based on the above update rule and the value of dp[i-1].

Finally, return dp[n+1]
