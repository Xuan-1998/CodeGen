===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use memoization to store and reuse solutions for overlapping subproblems, which would be rooms with already visited portals.

Define the state expression as dp[i][p_i]: number of ways to reach room p_i from room i, considering whether Vasya uses first or second portal in room i; dp[n+1][_] = 0, since there is no way to exit the maze.

dp[i][j] = 1 if i == n + 1 (Vasya reaches the last room); 
otherwise:
    for each k in p_i:
        let's consider Vasya uses first portal and then from room k to room j; 
        or he uses second portal and then from room k to room j;
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], min(dp[k-1][p_k-1], 2 - (dp[k-1][p_k-1] % 2)) + (i == n) ? 1 : 0);
