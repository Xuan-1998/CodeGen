===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use memoization to store and reuse solutions for overlapping subproblems, which would be rooms with already visited portals.

Define the state expression as dp[i]: number of ways to reach room i from room 1; dp[0] = 1, since Vasya can always exit the maze from room n+1.

dp[i]: number of ways to reach room i with an odd number of crosses on the ceiling; dp[0] = 1, since Vasya can always exit the maze from room n+1.

Memoize using a dictionary with keys as (room_index, cross_count) pairs and values as either 1 if it's possible to reach that room or 0 if not. To make sure our memoization is correct, we should also update dp[i] based on whether the ceiling of the current room has an odd number of crosses.

If the ceiling of the current room has an odd number of crosses, we can use the second portal (p_i) to reach p_i with an odd number of crosses. If the ceiling has an even number of crosses, we should use the first portal and move to i - 1 with an even number of crosses.

The base case is when Vasya reaches room n+1; at this point, he can always exit the maze, so dp[n+1] = 1.
