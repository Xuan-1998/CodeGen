===BEGIN PLAN===
The transition relationship could be defined based on the portal rules: if the ceiling has an odd number of crosses, take the second portal; otherwise, take the first one. We can use this rule to define a recurrence relation that depends only on the current state.

Let's denote dp[i][k] as the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach room i with k as the next reachable room. The transition relationship would then depend on whether k is equal to p_i or not.

The base case would be when we are at room n+1, which means we have reached the end of the maze and need no more moves. This can be represented as dp[n+1][k] = 0 for any k.

For each room i from 1 to n, we need to calculate the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach this room. We can do this by considering two cases: when k is equal to p_i and when it's not. In the first case, we know that we have reached room p_i and now we need to decide whether to go back or move forward. This would depend on the number of crosses on the ceiling.

In the second case, we are in room i but haven't reached room p_i yet. We can use this information to calculate the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach room p_i from here and then add 1 for the extra move.

We can use a dictionary to store the computed values of dp[][] and avoid calculating the same value multiple times.

The final answer would be the value stored in dp[1][k] where k is the next reachable room from room 1. This represents the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach the end of the maze.
