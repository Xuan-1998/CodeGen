===BEGIN PLAN===
The transition relationship could be defined based on the portal rules: if the ceiling has an odd number of crosses, take the second portal; otherwise, take the first one. We can use this rule to define a recurrence relation that depends only on the current state.

The state expression could be dp[i][j], representing the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach room i with j crosses on the ceiling.

The base case could be dp[0][0] = 1, as Vasya starts at room 1 and needs to get to room n+1. The transition relation can be defined as follows: if there are j crosses on the ceiling, Vasya will use the second portal to reach room p_i if j is odd, or the first portal if j is even.

The choice could be implementing a 2D DP table where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of moves needed to reach room i with j crosses on the ceiling. The states for previous rooms and previous numbers of crosses are sufficient to compute the state for the current room and number of crosses.
