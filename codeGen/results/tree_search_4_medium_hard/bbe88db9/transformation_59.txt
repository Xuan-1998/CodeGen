===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use memoization to store and reuse solutions for overlapping subproblems, which would be rooms with already visited portals.

Define the state expression as dp[i][j]: number of ways to reach room j from room i, considering whether Vasya has already used a portal in room i or not; dp[1][_] = 1, since Vasya can always start the maze.

Let f_i be the number of ways to reach room i. Then f_0 = 1 and for all i > 0: f_i = (f_{p_(i)} if ceiling contains odd crosses, f_{p_(i) - 1} if ceiling contains even crosses).

Use a dictionary to store the memoized results for each room and portal combination.

Let's consider edge cases:
- What if p_1 is equal to 0 or n+1? In this case, Vasya can't use any portals.
- How do we handle cases where p_i > i?

We can improve the plan by considering that we only need to keep track of rooms with unvisited portals.

We can also optimize the calculation of f_i by storing the number of ways to reach each room from its previous room.

Let's update our plan:
