===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use memoization to store and reuse solutions for overlapping subproblems, which would be rooms with already visited portals.

Define the state expression as dp[i][p_i]: number of ways to reach room p_i from room i, considering whether Vasya uses first or second portal in room i; dp[n+1][_] = 0, since there is no way to exit the maze.

memo = { } ; def dfs(i):
    if i == n+1: return 1;
    if i not in memo:
        p_i_odd = sum(dfs(p_0) | (p_0 % 2)) + sum(dfs(p_1) | ~ (p_1 % 2));
        p_i_even = sum(dfs(p_0) & ~(p_0 % 2)) + sum(dfs(p_1) & ~ (p_1 % 2));
        memo[i] = (p_i_odd + p_i_even) % 1000000007;
    return memo[i];

return dfs(1);
