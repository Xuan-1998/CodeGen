===BEGIN PLAN===
The transition relationship could be defined based on the portal rules: if the ceiling has an odd number of crosses, take the second portal; otherwise, take the first one.

We can use this rule to define a recurrence relation that depends only on the current state. Let's consider dp[i][x], representing the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach room i with x crosses on the ceiling.

The base case could be when we are in the last room (n+1), where there is no choice for Vasya, so dp[n+1][0] = 0 and dp[n+1][1] = 0.

For other rooms, let's consider the transition from dp[i-1][x] to dp[i][y]. If x is even (i.e., there are an even number of crosses on the ceiling), we use the first portal, which leads to y = x. So dp[i][x] = 1 + dp[i-1][x].

If x is odd (i.e., there are an odd number of crosses on the ceiling), we use the second portal, which leads to y = p_{i-1}. So dp[i][x] = 1 + dp[i-1][0].

We can initialize the base case as dp[0][0] = 0 and dp[0][1] = 0.

Finally, we calculate the result as the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach room n+1 with either 0 or 1 cross on the ceiling. This is represented by min(dp[n+1][0], dp[n+1][1]).
