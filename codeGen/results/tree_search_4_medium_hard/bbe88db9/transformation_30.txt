===BEGIN PLAN===
The transition relationship could be defined based on the portal rules: if the ceiling has an odd number of crosses, take the second portal; otherwise, take the first one. We can use this rule to define a recurrence relation that depends only on the current state.

Define the state as dp[i] = minimum portal moves to reach room i
dp[i] is the minimum number of moves from room 1 to room i, considering only the portals in rooms [1, i-1]. We can update dp[i] by considering all possible moves from room i-1 and choosing the one that minimizes the total number of moves.

To improve this plan, we could use a more efficient data structure for memoization, such as a trie or a binary heap. This would allow us to avoid recalculating subproblems that are far away from each other in the recurrence relation.

One potential issue with this plan is that it assumes that the ceiling of each room always has an odd number of crosses when we're choosing which portal to take. However, this assumption might not be correct if the problem statement doesn't guarantee this.

The plan does include edge cases: what happens when Vasya gets out of the maze? Should we count that as a move or not?
