===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem involves portals, we can define a state that captures the current room and whether it's been visited before. This will allow us to avoid revisiting rooms unnecessarily.

The state expression could be a tuple (room, visited), where room is the current room number and visited is a boolean indicating whether the room has been visited before.

We need to determine how many times Vasya needs to use portals to get out of the maze. This can be achieved by using DFS or BFS with memoization to avoid revisiting rooms unnecessarily.

The state transitions are determined by the rules given in the problem statement: if Vasya is in room i and has already painted a cross on its ceiling, he uses the second portal (leading to room p_{i}) if and only if the ceiling contains an odd number of crosses, otherwise he uses the first portal.

We can define a function dp(i) that returns the minimum number of times Vasya needs to use portals to get from room 1 to room i. The base case is when i is equal to (n+1), in which case the answer is always 0.

The recursive case is when i is less than (n+1). In this case, we need to consider two options: using the first portal and using the second portal. We can use the following recurrence relation:

dp(i) = min(dp(p_{i}) + 1, dp(j) + 1), where j is the room that can be reached by using the first portal from room i.

The answer will be the minimum value obtained from this recurrence relation.

We need to take care of edge cases such as when the input is invalid. We can use error handling and validation to ensure that the inputs are within the valid range.
