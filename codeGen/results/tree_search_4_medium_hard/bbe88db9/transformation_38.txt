===BEGIN PLAN===
The transition relationship could be defined based on the portal rules: if there are x crosses on the ceiling and Vasya is in room i, take the second portal to reach room p_i if x is odd; otherwise, take the first portal. We can use this rule to define a recurrence relation that depends only on the current state.

The state expression could be dp[i][x], representing the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach room i with x crosses on the ceiling.

The transition relationship can be defined as follows: if there are x crosses on the ceiling, Vasya will use the second portal to reach room p_i if x is odd, or the first portal if x is even. This means that for each cell dp[i], we need to consider two possibilities: whether Vasya reaches room i with an odd number of crosses or an even number.

The DP state could be represented as a 2D array dp where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of moves needed to reach room i with j crosses on the ceiling. The transition rule would be applied iteratively from left to right, updating each cell based on the values in its previous cells.

To improve this plan, we can use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming state and apply the transition rule iteratively from left to right. This way, we only need to keep track of the current room and the number of crosses on the ceiling.

A potential issue with this plan is that it assumes Vasya always takes the optimal decision based on the number of crosses on the ceiling. However, this assumption is correct because Vasya's decisions are deterministic based on the portal rules and the state of the ceiling.

The plan includes edge cases by considering all possible numbers of crosses (0 to n+1) for each room from 1 to n+1.
