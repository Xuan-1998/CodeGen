===BEGIN PLAN===
We can define a state that captures the current room and whether it's been visited before. This will allow us to avoid revisiting rooms unnecessarily.

The state expression could be a tuple of (room, visited), where room is the current room number and visited is a boolean indicating whether the room has been visited before.

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem by creating a table dp where dp[i] represents the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach room i. The base case would be dp[1], which is always 0, since we start at room 1.

The recursive case would be:

dp[i] = min(dp[p] + (crosses % 2), dp[j] + 1)

where p and j are the rooms that can be reached by using the first and second portal respectively, and crosses is the number of crosses on the ceiling.

We need to initialize all dp values to infinity and update them based on the state expression. We also need to handle edge cases where the input n is too large or too small.

This plan seems correct, but it can be improved by using a more efficient data structure such as a priority queue instead of dynamic programming.
