===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using Dynamic Programming, let's define the state as (room, portals) where room is the current room number and portals are two lists representing the one-way portals.

Initially, we can set up a DP table dp of size n+1 with all values initialized to -1. The base case would be when we're in room 1, we have only one option which is to move to room p_1 (the first portal). So, dp[0] = 1.

For each room i from 2 to n+1:

* Calculate the number of times Vasya needs to use portals to get out of the maze by considering two options:
	+ If the ceiling hasn't been painted yet, we can choose either of the two portals (dp[i-1] + 1).
	+ If the ceiling has been painted, we can only use one of the two portals based on whether there are odd or even number of crosses. Let's denote this as dp[p_i - 1].
* Update the DP table with the minimum of these two options.
* Backtrack to find the optimal path.

Finally, return dp[n] as the result.
