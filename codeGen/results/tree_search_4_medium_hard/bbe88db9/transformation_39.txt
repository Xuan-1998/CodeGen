===BEGIN PLAN===
The transition relationship could be defined based on the portal rules: if the ceiling has an odd number of crosses, take the second portal; otherwise, take the first one. We can use this rule to define a recurrence relation that depends only on the current state.

The state expression could be dp[i][k], representing the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach room i with k as the next reachable room (0 or p_i). The transition relationship would then depend on whether k is equal to p_i or not.

Define a dynamic programming table dp[][] as [[0 for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(2)]. Fill the base case (dp[0][0] = 1) and then fill the rest of the dp[] array based on the recurrence relation: if k == p_i, dp[i][k] = dp[i-1][p_i] + 1; else dp[i][k] = dp[i-1][k] + (dp[i-1][k] % 2).
The final answer would be dp[n][n+1].
