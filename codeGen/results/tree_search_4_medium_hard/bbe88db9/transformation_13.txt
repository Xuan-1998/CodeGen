===BEGIN PLAN===
Define a state as a tuple (room, portals_used, ceiling_painted) where:
  - room is an integer representing the current room number
  - portals_used is an integer representing the number of portal moves used to reach this room
  - ceiling_painted is a boolean indicating whether the ceiling has been painted

Create a priority queue min_heap PQ and initialize it with the starting state (1, 0, False)

While PQ is not empty:
  Extract the state with the minimum portals_used from PQ
  If the extracted state's room is the target room (n+1):
    Return the number of portal moves used to reach this room
  For each one-way portal in the current room:
    Calculate the new state by using the first or second portal depending on ceiling_painted being True or False
    Add the new state to PQ if it has not been visited before

===END PLAN===
