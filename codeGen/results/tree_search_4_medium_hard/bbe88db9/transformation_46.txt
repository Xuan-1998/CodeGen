===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use memoization to store and reuse solutions for overlapping subproblems, which would be rooms with already visited portals.

Define the state expression as dp[i]: number of ways to reach room i from room 1; dp[0] = 1, since Vasya can always exit the maze from room n+1.

dp[i]: minimum number of portal moves required to reach room i; dp[0] = 1, since Vasya starts at room 1.

Using a dictionary memo to store and reuse solutions for overlapping subproblems:

    For each room i:
        If i is the starting room (i.e., room 1), then dp[i] = 1
        Otherwise:
            Let p be the portal leading out of room i
            Let j be the room that can be reached by using this portal
            dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[j]) + 1 if p is even, or dp[i-1] otherwise

    The final answer is dp[n]
