===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use memoization to store and reuse solutions for overlapping subproblems, which would be rooms with already visited portals.

Define the state expression as dp[i][j]: number of ways to reach room j from room i, considering whether Vasya has already used a portal in room i or not; dp[1][_]=1, since Vasya can always start the maze.

dp[i][j] = 0 if j < i, since it's impossible to reach a smaller room number. 
dp[i][k] + 1 if k is a previously visited room and Vasya has already used a portal in room i.
Otherwise, dp[i][p_{i-1}] + 1 if the second portal hasn't been used yet; otherwise, dp[i-1][p_{i-1}].

Use dynamic programming with recursion to break down the problem into smaller subproblems.
