===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem involves portals, we can define a state that captures the current room and whether it's been visited before. This will allow us to avoid revisiting rooms unnecessarily.

The state expression could be a tuple (room, visited), where room is an integer representing the current room number and visited is a boolean indicating whether the room has been visited before.

State: (room, visited)
Transition: 
  - If the ceiling contains an odd number of crosses:
    + next_room = p[room-1] if room > 1 else n+1
    + next_visited = True
  - Otherwise:
    + next_room = room-1 if room > 1 else 0
    + next_visited = False

We can implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary to store the intermediate results.

State transitions should be stored in the dictionary along with their corresponding values.

The base case for the recursion would be when we reach the last room (n+1), at which point Vasya needs 0 portal moves to get out of the maze.

We can use this recursive function to build a dynamic programming table that stores the minimum number of portal moves required to reach each room.

Finally, we can return the value in the table corresponding to the initial room (room 1) as the answer.
