===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use memoization to store and reuse solutions for overlapping subproblems, which would be rooms with already visited portals.

Define the state expression as dp[i][j]: number of ways to reach room j from room i, considering whether Vasya has already used a portal in room i or not; dp[1][0]=1, since Vasya can always start the maze. We need to consider that p_i is inclusive.

dp[i][j] = 1 if j == i; 
dp[i-1][p_{i-1}] + 1 if p_{i-1} is the previous room visited from room i-1, considering whether Vasya has already painted a cross on ceiling of room i-1 or not. 

Implement a recursive function that uses memoization to store intermediate results and avoids recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.

dp[i][j] = 0 if i > j (base case: we can't reach room j from room i)

The plan is correct but it's missing one crucial part, which is calculating dp[i-1][p_{i-1}] considering whether Vasya has already painted a cross on ceiling of room i or not. This can be achieved by checking if the number of crosses in the ceiling of room i is odd or even and then decide to use the first or second portal accordingly.

The plan includes edge cases, as it correctly handles base case where i > j.
