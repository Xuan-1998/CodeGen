===BEGIN PLAN===
The transition relationship could be defined based on the portal rules: if the ceiling has an odd number of crosses, take the second portal; otherwise, take the first one. We can use this rule to define a recurrence relation that depends only on the current state.

Define the state as dp[i] = minimum portal moves to reach room i
dp[i] is the minimum number of moves from room 1 to room i, considering only the portals in rooms [1, i-1]. We can update dp[i] by considering all possible moves from room i-1 and choosing the one that minimizes the total number of moves.

We can use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach using a 2D array dp[i][j] to store the state representing the minimum number of moves from room i-1 to room j, considering only the portals in rooms [i-1, j].

Let's initialize dp[0][0] = 0 (since we start at room 1 and need to reach room n+1).

Then, for each room i, update dp[i][j] as follows:
    - If i == 1, then dp[i][j] is the minimum number of moves from room 1 to room j, considering only the portals in rooms [1, j].
    - Otherwise, consider all possible moves from room i-1 and choose the one that minimizes the total number of moves.

Finally, return dp[n+1][n+1] as the answer.
