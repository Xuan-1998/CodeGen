dp[i] represents whether you can reach the (i+1)th room from the first room.
Initialize dp with all values as False.
Set dp[0] to True since you are always in the starting room.
For each room i from 1 to n:
    For each portal p in range(i):
        if you can reach the next room j = p[i] and j <= n:
            dp[j] = True
Return dp[n]
