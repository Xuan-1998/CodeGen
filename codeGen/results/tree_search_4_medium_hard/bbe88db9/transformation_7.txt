===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem involves portals, we can define a state that captures the current room and whether it's been visited before. This will allow us to avoid revisiting rooms unnecessarily.

The state expression could be a tuple of (room, used_second_portal), where room is the current room number and used_second_portal is a boolean indicating whether the second portal was used to reach the current room.

We can represent the state as a dictionary, where each key is a tuple of (room, used_second_portal) and its value is the minimum number of portal moves required to reach that room.

Use a recursive function with memoization to keep track of the minimum number of portal moves required to reach each room. The base case would be when we are in the target room (n+1), at which point we return 0, since we've reached the end of the maze.

In each recursive step, we consider two possibilities: using the first or second portal. We recursively call the function for both cases and choose the one that requires fewer moves.

We update the memoization dictionary with the result of the current room and its corresponding state.

Finally, we return the value stored in the memoization dictionary for the initial state (room 1, used_second_portal=False).

This approach ensures we avoid revisiting rooms unnecessarily by using memoization to store previously computed results. This way, we can efficiently compute the minimum number of portal moves required to reach each room.
