===BEGIN PLAN===
The transition relationship could be defined based on the portal rules: if the ceiling has an odd number of crosses, take the second portal; otherwise, take the first one. We can use this rule to define a recurrence relation that depends only on the current state.

Define the state as dp[i] = minimum portal moves to reach room i.
dp[i] represents the number of times Vasya needs to use portals to reach room i. We can update dp[i] based on whether the ceiling has an odd or even number of crosses, which depends on p_{i-1}.

Use a 2D array dp[][] to store the minimum portal moves to reach each room.
dp[0] = 0 (initial state)
For each i from 1 to n:
    if p_{i-1} is odd:
        dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[p_{i-1}] + 1) if ceiling has an odd number of crosses
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] if ceiling has an even number of crosses
    else:
        dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[p_{i-1}] + 1)
Return dp[n+1]
