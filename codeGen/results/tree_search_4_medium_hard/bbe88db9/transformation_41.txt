===BEGIN PLAN===
The transition relationship could be defined based on the portal rules: if the ceiling has an odd number of crosses, take the second portal; otherwise, take the first one. We can use this rule to define a recurrence relation that depends only on the current state.

The state expression could be dp[i][0] and dp[i][1], representing the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach room i with 0 or 1 crosses on the ceiling, respectively.

Use tabulation by initializing a dynamic programming table with zeros, filling the dp[i][k] state expression for k=0 and k=1, considering the dependencies on dp[j][0] and dp[j][1] for j<i. This way, we can compute the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach room i.

The recurrence relation could be:

- If p_i = 1: dp[i][0] = 1 + min(dp[p_i-1][k]) for k=0 and k=1
- If p_i > 1: dp[i][0] = 1 + min(dp[p_i-1][0], dp[p_i-1][1])
- If p_i = i: dp[i][1] = 1

The base case would be when i=1, where the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach room 1 is always 0.

Finally, print the value of dp[n+1][0] and dp[n+1][1], as these represent the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach room n+1 with 0 or 1 crosses on the ceiling, respectively. The minimum of these two values would be the answer.
