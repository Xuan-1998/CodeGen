dp[i][p_i] = number of ways to reach room p_i from room i, considering whether Vasya uses first or second portal in room i; dp[n+1][_] = 0, since there is no way to exit the maze.

dp = [[{for j in range(1, n + 2)}], ..., [{}]] for i in range(n + 1); dp[n + 1] = [[0], ..., [0]]

Initialize: dp[i][p_i] = 0 for all (i, p_i) pairs

For i from 1 to n:
    For each portal p_i in the i-th room:
        If Vasya is currently in room i and has not yet visited this portal:
            If there are no crosses on the ceiling of the current room:
                dp[i][p_i] = dp[i-1][p_i-1] + 1

Return dp[n+1][n+1]
