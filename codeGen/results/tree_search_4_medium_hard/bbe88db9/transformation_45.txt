===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use memoization to store and reuse solutions for overlapping subproblems, which would be rooms with already visited portals.
Define the state expression as dp[i]: number of ways Vasya needs to move from room 1 to reach room i; dp[n+1] = 0, since he needs to exit the maze.
For each room i, calculate the number of ways to reach it using both first and second portals. The choice of portal depends on whether there's an odd or even number of crosses painted so far.
Use memoization with a recursive function and a memo dictionary to store the solutions for overlapping subproblems.
