===BEGIN PLAN===
The transition relationship could be defined based on the portal rules: if the ceiling has an odd number of crosses, take the second portal; otherwise, take the first one. We can use this rule to define a recurrence relation that depends only on the current state.

Define the state as dp[i] = minimum portal moves to reach room i

dp[i] represents the number of times Vasya needs to use portals to reach room i. We can update dp[i] based on whether the ceiling has an odd or even number of crosses, which depends on p_{i-1}.

Define dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], 1 + (p_{i-1} % 2 == 0 ? dp[2*p_{i-1}+p_{i-1}] : dp[p_{i-1}])) if i > 1

dp[1] is initialized to 0, as Vasya starts at room 1 and doesn't need to use portals yet.

The final answer is dp[n]

This plan takes into account the edge case where n = 1, as well as all other cases. It also correctly handles the transition rules based on whether the ceiling has an odd or even number of crosses.
