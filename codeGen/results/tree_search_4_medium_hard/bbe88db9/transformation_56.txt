===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use memoization to store and reuse solutions for overlapping subproblems, which would be rooms with already visited portals.

Define the state expression as dp[i][j]: number of ways to reach room j from room i, considering whether Vasya has already used a portal in room i or not; dp[1]_[_]=1, since Vasya can always start the maze.

dp[i][j] = 1 if j == i; dp[i-1][p] + 1 if p is the previous room visited from room i-1, considering whether Vasya has already painted a cross on ceiling of room i-1 or not.

Create a dictionary-based memoization approach to store and reuse solutions for overlapping subproblems. For each cell in the dp array, check if it's already computed; if so, return the stored value. If not, compute the value based on the state expression and update the dictionary with the new value.

To avoid redundant computation, iterate over the dp array in reverse order (from room n+1 to 1). This ensures that we only compute values for rooms that have already been visited at least once.

Note: The plan does not explicitly handle edge cases; however, it's designed to implicitly handle them. For example, if p_i is greater than i, the plan will correctly recognize this as an invalid input and return a incorrect value (potentially a large number).

The only potential issue with the plan is the possibility of redundant computation due to the lack of explicit handling for edge cases. However, by iterating over the dp array in reverse order, we minimize the chance of redundant computation.
