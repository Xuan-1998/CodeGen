===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem involves portals, we can define a state that captures the current room and whether it's been visited before. This will allow us to avoid revisiting rooms unnecessarily.

The state expression could be a tuple (room, visited), where room is the current room number and visited is a boolean indicating whether the room has been visited before.

Designing a dynamic programming solution by creating a 3D DP table with dimensions (n+1) x (2^k), where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach room i from room 1, considering that we've already visited k rooms in our current path. Initially, set dp[0][0] = 0 and dp[0][1] = -âˆž for all k.

Fill the DP table by iterating over each room i and its corresponding portals p_i. For each cell dp[i][j], consider two cases:

- Case 1: If we haven't visited any rooms yet (k = 0), then dp[i][j] is the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach room i from room 1, considering that we've just entered this room.
- Case 2: If we have visited some rooms already (k > 0), then dp[i][j] is the minimum number of portal moves needed to reach room i from room 1, considering that we've just entered this room and haven't crossed any portals yet.

Update dp[i][j] accordingly by taking the minimum between these two cases. Finally, set dp[n+1][k] as the result for k rooms visited.
