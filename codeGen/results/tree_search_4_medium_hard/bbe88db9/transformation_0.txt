===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be a tuple of (room, visited, crosses), where room is the current room number, visited is a boolean indicating whether the room has been visited before, and crosses is an integer representing the number of crosses on the ceiling.

Using a 2D array dp to represent the state space with dimensions n+1 by 3. Each cell [i][j] can store the minimum number of portal moves required to reach i-th room after j-th visit. 

Define base cases: 
- If the current room is 0 (the start), set dp[1][0][0] = 0, and dp[i][j][k] = -∞ for all i > 1.

Recurrence relation:
- For each cell [i][j], if the ceiling has an odd number of crosses, use the second portal to reach room p_{i}. Otherwise, use the first portal.
- dp[i][j][0] = min(dp[p_{i}][k-1][0] + 1, dp[i-1][j-1][0] + 1) if j > 0 else -∞.

The answer is stored in dp[n+1][2][c], where c represents the number of crosses on the ceiling when Vasya reaches room (n+1).
