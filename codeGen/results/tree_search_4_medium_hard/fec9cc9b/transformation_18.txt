===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify the longest non-decreasing subsequence in the array as the base case, then use top-down approach with memoization to determine if a given subsegment is a ladder by checking if it's equal to the longest non-decreasing subsequence found so far.

dp[i] = True if array[0:i] is a non-decreasing subsequence, False otherwise

Formulate dp[i] as the longest length of ladder ending at index i. Transition: 
dp[i] = max(dp[j]) for all j such that 0 <= j < i and array[j] != array[i].

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a table with n+1 rows, where each row represents the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at index i. Then, fill up the table by iterating through the array from left to right.

For each query (l, r), check if dp[r] - dp[l-1] is greater than 0. If it is, then the subsegment [l, r] is a ladder, otherwise it's not.
