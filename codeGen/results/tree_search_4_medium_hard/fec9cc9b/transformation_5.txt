===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] = 1 if array[j] is the maximum value in the subsegment [i..j], and
    dp[i-1][k] for all k such that array[k] <= array[j]
else:
    return dp[i-1][j-1]

Find the maximum k such that array[k] <= array[j]
Consider a binary tree where each node represents whether the subsegment is a ladder or not
dp[j] stores the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at index j
