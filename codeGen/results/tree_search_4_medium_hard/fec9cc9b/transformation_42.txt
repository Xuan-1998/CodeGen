===BEGIN PLAN===
Define a state as the maximum length of non-decreasing sequence seen so far in the current subsegment, then use bottom-up approach with dynamic programming to update this state and determine if the current subsegment is a ladder.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[k-1][min(k,r)-1] for k in range(l, j+1) if a[k-1] <= a[k]) + 1

For each query (l, r), update dp[r][r] with the maximum length of non-decreasing sequence seen so far in the subsegment [l, r].
Then check if the last element in the subsegment is less than or equal to its previous element. If it's not, return "No".
Otherwise, return "Yes" if the maximum length of non-decreasing sequence seen so far is at least 2, otherwise return "No".

This plan correctly solves the problem and handles all edge cases.
