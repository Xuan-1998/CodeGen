===BEGIN PLAN===
Code a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at index j in the array slice from 0 to i.

For each query, iterate over the array slice from l to r and maintain two variables: the maximum element encountered so far and the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at the current position.

If the maximum element encountered is less than or equal to the previous maximum, it means we've found a decreasing sequence. In this case, update dp[i][j] with the new length and check if the query subsegment from l to r is a ladder by comparing it to the stored values in dp.

Avoid comparing elements of the array by instead comparing their ranks in the array. Use a combination of prefix sums and suffix sums to solve this problem.
