===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize an array dp with n+1 rows and m+1 columns to store whether each subsegment is a valid ladder.
2. Define a function get_ladder(i, j) that returns whether the subsegment [i, j] is a valid ladder:
   * If i == j, return True if array[i-1] <= array[j], False otherwise
   * Otherwise, check if there are any increasing or decreasing elements within the subsegment. Initialize an array seen to store the last seen element.
   * Iterate over each element in the subsegment:
     - If the current element is less than or equal to the last seen element, update seen with the current element and continue
     - Otherwise, return False if there are any decreasing elements, True otherwise (since we've found a non-increasing sequence)
3. For queries, iterate over each query (l, r), and for each query:
   * If array[l-1] <= array[r-1], it's possible to form a valid ladder; otherwise, the subsegment is not a ladder.
4. Print "Yes" if the subsegment is a valid ladder, "No" otherwise.

Here's the Python code implementing this plan:
