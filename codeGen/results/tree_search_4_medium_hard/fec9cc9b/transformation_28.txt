1. Initialize a 2D array dp with size (n + 1) * (r - l + 1) filled with False. It will store whether a ladder is possible for each subsegment.

2. Iterate over all queries and for each query, iterate over the subsegment from index l to r.

3. Initialize three variables: inc, dec, and flag. inc and dec represent the longest increasing/decreasing sequence found so far in the subsegment. flag will be True if a ladder is possible for this subsegment.

4. Iterate over the subsegment again and for each element, check if it's part of an increasing or decreasing sequence. If it's part of an increasing sequence (inc + 1), update inc and reset dec to 0. If it's part of a decreasing sequence (dec + 1), update dec and reset inc to 0.

5. After iterating over the subsegment, check if either inc or dec is greater than 0. If so, set flag to True.

6. Store the result in dp[i][j] based on the value of flag: dp[i][j] = flag.

7. To answer queries efficiently, iterate over the array and for each element, update a 1D array seen with its index. Then, iterate over all queries and for each query, find the longest increasing/decreasing sequence ending at indices l to r by binary searching in seen.

8. Finally, iterate over all queries again and print "Yes" if dp[i][j] is True, otherwise "No".
