===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify the longest non-decreasing subsequence in the array as the base case, then use top-down approach with memoization to determine if a given subsegment is a ladder by checking if it's equal to the longest non-decreasing subsequence found so far.

dp[i][j] = True if array[i...j] is a ladder, False otherwise

Use a bottom-up approach instead of top-down to dynamically build up the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the given array using memoization. This can help reduce the number of recursive calls and improve performance.

Dynamically iterate over the array and for each element, calculate the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at that position. Store this value in a 1D array dp[i] to keep track of the longest non-decreasing subsequences found so far.

When processing a query, compare the given subsegment with the longest non-decreasing subsequence found for the corresponding range in the original array. If they match, then the query subsegment is a ladder. Otherwise, it's not.
