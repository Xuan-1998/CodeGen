===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there are any increasing or decreasing elements within the subsegment, and use bottom-up approach with tabulation to generate all possible combinations of such elements and check if they form a valid ladder.

dp[i][j] = True if array[i-1] <= array[j] and j == r - 1, False otherwise

Consider a subsegment as a valid ladder if it is non-decreasing up to the first decreasing element, and then non-increasing from that point onward.

To use tabulation by initializing an array of size n+1, where each element at index i represents whether the subsegment ending at i is a valid ladder. 

dp[i] = True if array[j-1] <= array[j] for all j in range(i), False otherwise

For each query l and r:

    Calculate dp[r] - dp[l-1] to check if the subsegment defined by l and r is a ladder.

    If it is, print "Yes", else print "No".
