===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there are any increasing or decreasing elements within the subsegment, and use bottom-up approach with tabulation to generate all possible combinations of such elements and check if they form a valid ladder.

Let array be the given array and n be its size. Let m be the number of queries.

For each query (l, r), consider the subarray from l to r. Initialize two arrays, decreasing and increasing, both initially empty. Traverse the subarray in reverse order. If an element is less than or equal to the previous one, add it to decreasing; if it is greater than the previous one, add it to increasing.

Now we have all elements of the subsegment partitioned into either a non-decreasing sequence (decreasing) or a non-increasing sequence (increasing).

The subsegment is a ladder if and only if there exists a non-decreasing sequence and a non-increasing sequence such that their union is equal to the entire subarray.

We can solve this using dynamic programming. Let dp[i][j] be true if the subarray from i to j is a ladder, and false otherwise. Then we have:

dp[0][i] = (increasing is empty or increasing[0] <= array[i]) and i == r - 1

For all other values of i and j, dp[i][j] = decreasing.isEmpty() || decreasing.get(0) <= array[j]

The result for the query (l, r) is dp[l-1][r-1].

Check if there exists an element in the subsegment which is not part of a valid ladder sequence. You can use memoization by creating a dictionary to store the results of subproblems, and then use recursion to solve the problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.
