===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there are any increasing or decreasing elements within the subsegment.
For each query, use two pointers, left and right, to traverse the subsegment from both ends.
left points to the first element of the subsegment (index l), and right points to the last element (index r).
Initially, set a flag 'is_ladder' to True.
Iterate through the subsegment, moving either left or right depending on whether the current element is less than or greater than the previous one:
    If the current element is not in increasing order with the previous one, increment left until it is again in increasing order (or reaches r).
    If the current element is not in decreasing order with the previous one, decrement right until it is again in decreasing order (or reaches l).
    Update 'is_ladder' based on whether we reached the end of the subsegment:
        If left > r or right < l, set 'is_ladder' to False.
Print "Yes" if 'is_ladder' is True for a query; otherwise print "No".
