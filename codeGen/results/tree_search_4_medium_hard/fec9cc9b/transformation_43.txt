===BEGIN PLAN===
Define states dp[i][j] for 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= m as follows:
dp[i][j] = 1 if the subsegment from index l to r is a ladder, and 0 otherwise.

Use bottom-up approach with tabulation to fill up the DP table.
For each query (l, r), check if dp[r-l+1][r-1] == 1. If it is, then print "Yes", else print "No".

The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m) and space complexity is also O(n*m).
