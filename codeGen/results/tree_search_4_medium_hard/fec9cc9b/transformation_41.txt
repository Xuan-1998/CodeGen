===BEGIN PLAN===
Define a state as the maximum length of non-increasing sequence seen so far in the current subsegment, then use bottom-up approach with dynamic programming to update this state and determine if the current subsegment is a ladder.

dp[i][j] = 0 for i from 1 to n and j from l to r
for i from 2 to n:
    for j from l to r:
        if a[i-1] <= a[i]:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k-1] for k in range(l, j+1) if a[k-1] <= a[k]) + 1
        else:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k-1] for k in range(j, r+1) if a[k-1] >= a[k]) + 1

for i from 1 to n:
    for j from l to r:
        if (dp[i][j] % 2 == 0):
            print("Yes")
        else:
            print("No")
