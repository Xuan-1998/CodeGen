===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify the longest non-decreasing subsequence in the array as the base case, then use top-down approach with memoization to determine if a given subsegment is a ladder by checking if it's equal to the longest non-decreasing subsequence found so far.

dp[i] = True if array[0:i] is a non-decreasing subsequence, False otherwise

Formulate dp[i] as the longest length of ladder ending at index i. Transition: dp[i] = max(dp[j]) for all j such that 0 <= j < i and array[j] != array[i].

Implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents whether the subsegment array[i..j] is a non-decreasing sequence.

Then, use this table to determine if each query is a ladder by checking if the corresponding subsegment in the table is a ladder.

For each query (l, r), check if there exists some k such that 0 <= k < l and dp[l][k] = True. If so, return "Yes" because array[0:l] contains a non-decreasing sequence. Otherwise, return "No".
