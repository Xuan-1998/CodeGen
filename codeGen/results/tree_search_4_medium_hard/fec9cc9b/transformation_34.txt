===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there are any increasing or decreasing elements within the subsegment, and use bottom-up approach with tabulation to generate all possible combinations of such elements and check if they form a valid ladder.

dp[i][j] = (i == 1 or (array[i-1] <= array[j] and dp[i-1][j])) or (i > 0 and array[i-1] >= array[j] and dp[i-1][j])
Consider using a boolean array to track if the current segment is increasing or decreasing.

dp[i][j] = (i == 0 or (array[0] <= array[j] and dp[0][j])) or (i > 0 and array[i-1] >= array[j] and dp[i-1][j])
===END PLAN===
