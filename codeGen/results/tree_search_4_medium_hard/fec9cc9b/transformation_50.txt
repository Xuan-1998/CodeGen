Define a state as the maximum length of non-increasing sequence seen so far in the current subsegment, then use top-down approach with memoization to update this state and determine if the current subsegment is a ladder.

dp[i][j] = {
    (a[i-1] >= a[j]) && (dp[i-1][l-1] > 0) ? dp[i-1][l-1]+1 : 0
}

Consider using a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1) where dp[i][j] stores whether the subarray from i to j is a ladder, and update dp[i][j] based on dp[i-1][l-1] and a[l-1] >= a[r-1].

for each query l and r:
    for i from l to r:
        if (dp[i][j] > 0) {
            print "Yes"
            break
        }
    if no "Yes" was printed, print "No"

This plan is mostly correct, but it can be improved by avoiding unnecessary computations. The top-down approach with memoization is a good start, but the current implementation still does a lot of repeated work.

To improve this plan, we can use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach instead. This way, we only need to compute each dp[i][j] once, and we don't need to repeat any computations.

The edge cases are handled correctly in this plan. For example, the plan will correctly handle the case where there is no subarray that is a ladder.
