dp[i][j] = True if array[i-1] <= array[j] and j == r - 1, False otherwise;
For each query, calculate dp[l][r];
If all elements in the subsegment are non-decreasing, return "Yes";
Else, check for any increasing sequence;
    For each possible increasing sequence, 
        Calculate its length, and update dp[i][j] accordingly; 
    Return "No" if there is an increasing sequence of length more than 1;

    For each possible decreasing sequence,

    Return "No" if there is a decreasing sequence of length more than 1;
Return "Yes" if all sequences are valid ladders.
