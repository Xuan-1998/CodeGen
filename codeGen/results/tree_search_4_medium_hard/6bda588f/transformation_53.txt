===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem could be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice for solving this problem.

The base case would be when n = 0, in which case F can only take a single value depending on the last integer in the sequence. We can use this as our starting point and work backwards to find the minimum possible value of F.

Formulate the state as (n, s) where n is the number of elements remaining to process and s is the shift value. The transition relationship would involve calculating F for the current state and updating the next state accordingly.

We can keep track of the minimum possible F as we iterate through the states using dynamic programming. Use a dictionary memo to store the minimum F values calculated so far and check if the result is already computed before calculating it recursively.

To calculate F, consider two cases: when s is greater than or equal to the current number in the sequence, and when it's not. In the former case, we can set x_i = 0 and y_i = a_i - s. In the latter case, we can set x_i = a_i - s and y_i = 0.

Use this insight to fill out the memo dictionary. For each state (n, s), calculate F by considering these two cases and keeping track of the minimum possible value.

Finally, return the result stored in the memo dictionary for the initial state (n, s).
