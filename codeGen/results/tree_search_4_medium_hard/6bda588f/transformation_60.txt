===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem can be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice
Let the state expression be (i, left_sum, right_sum) where i is the current index, left_sum is the sum of the first i integers, and right_sum is the sum of the remaining integers. The base case would be when i = 0 or i = n-1.
Consider a recursive function that takes as input the current index i, the sum of the first i integers (left_sum), and the sum of the remaining integers (right_sum). 
The transition relationships can be formulated by considering the minimum possible value of F for each subproblem: 

F(i) = min(F(i-1) + a_i * x_{i+1} + y_{i+1} * right_sum, F(i-2) + a_{i-1} * (x_i - s) + y_{i-1} * (right_sum - 2s))

This recursive function can be translated into a dynamic programming algorithm by using bottom-up tabulation. 
Design a tabulation-based algorithm that builds up the solution by iteratively computing the minimum possible value of F for each index i, using previously computed values: 

dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + a_i * x_{i+1} + y_{i+1} * (right_sum - 2s), dp[i-2] + a_{i-1} * (x_i - s) + y_{i-1} * (right_sum - 2s))

The base case would be when i = 0 or i = n-1, and the initial values for the first two indices could be set to 0.
Finally, return dp[n-1] as the minimum possible value of F.
