===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem could be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice.

The base case would be when n = 0, in which case F can only take a single value depending on the last integer in the sequence.

Formulate the state as a tuple (n, s) where n is the current number of elements in the sequence and s is the current shift value. The transition relationship would be when we consider a new element in the sequence and update our current state accordingly.

Tabulating the problem by creating a 2D array dp[][], where dp[i][j] is the minimum possible value of F for a sequence of length i with shift j.

The recursive formula would be: 

- If n = 0, then dp[n][s] = a[0]
- Otherwise, dp[n][s] = min(dp[n-1][s]) + a[n]*a[n]

This plan seems correct. It correctly identifies the base case and formulates the state and transition relationship.

One potential issue is that we are not considering all possible values of F for a given state (n, s). We need to consider both x_i = 0 and y_i = 0 in our transition relation.

Another potential issue is that our recursive formula is incorrect. The correct formula would be the minimum value between the two cases: dp[n-1][s] + a[n]*a[n] and dp[n-2][s-a[n]] + a[n]*(a[n]-s).

This plan does not include edge cases, but it can be easily modified to handle them by adding base cases for n = 0 and s = 0.
