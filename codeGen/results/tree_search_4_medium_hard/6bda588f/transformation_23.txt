===BEGIN PLAN===
The state is a tuple (i, s) where i is the current index and s is the current sum.
Initialize a 2D array dp with size n+1 * (s+1), filled with infinity.
dp[i][s] will store the minimum possible value of F for each index i and sum s.

Top-down recursive function:
- Base case: when i reaches n, return 0
- For each possible way to split a_i into x_i and y_i:
  - If (x_i-s)*(y_i-s) >= 0
    - Calculate the new sum dp[i+1][s+a_i-x_i]
    - Update dp[i][s] with the minimum of its current value and F = a_i * x_i + y_i * x_i + dp[i+1][s+a_i-x_i]

Update dp[0][s] to be the minimum possible value of F for each sum s.
Return dp[0][sum(a)]
