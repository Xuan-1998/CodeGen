===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you start by solving smaller subproblems and gradually build up to the original problem.

 Define the state as (i, j) where i is the current index from 1 to n and j is the difference between ai and s. The base case would be when i = 1, in which case the minimum value of F can be calculated by iterating over all possible values for y1 and x1 that satisfy x1 + y1 = a1.

Formulate a dynamic programming approach that uses two arrays dp and dp_prev to keep track of the minimum values for subproblems. The transition relationship would involve calculating the minimum value for F when i-1 and j-ai+i, considering all possible values for xi.

Use a hash map to memoize intermediate results, where the key is the current state (i, j) and the value is the minimum value of F when i indices are processed with j as the difference between ai and s. This can help avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.

To handle edge cases, consider initializing dp[0][j] to infinity for all j, since there are no valid states when i = 0. Also, make sure to update dp_prev correctly based on the calculated values in dp.
