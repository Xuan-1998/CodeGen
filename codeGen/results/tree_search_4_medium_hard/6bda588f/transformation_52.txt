===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem could be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice
We can apply dynamic programming by breaking the problem into smaller subproblems and solving each one only once. This approach avoids redundant computation and helps us find the minimum possible value of F efficiently.

The base case would be when n = 0, in which case F can only take a single value depending on the last integer in the sequence.
This is because there are no more elements to process, so we simply calculate the minimum F based on the remaining shift values and previous results.

Formulate the state as (n, s) where n is the number of elements remaining to process and s is the shift value. The transition relationship would involve calculating F for the current state and updating the next state accordingly.
We can use a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum F for the sequence from i to n with shift value j.

The dynamic programming approach involves solving smaller subproblems, then combining the results to obtain the solution to the original problem. We can initialize the dp array with values representing the base case (n = 0), then fill in the remaining cells using the transition relationship.
This way, we avoid redundant computation and ensure that each cell is filled only once.

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum F for the sequence from i to n with shift value j.
The final answer would be the value of dp[n][s].
