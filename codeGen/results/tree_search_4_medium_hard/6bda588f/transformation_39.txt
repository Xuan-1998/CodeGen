===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about applying memoization to a top-down recursive function that solves the problem
The state is the current number in the sequence and the previous value of F, and the base case is when the sequence is empty.

Formulate the state as (i, prev_F) where i is the current index in the sequence and prev_F is the previous value of F. The transition relationship can be formulated by updating the minimum possible value of F for each index using dynamic programming.

Create a memoization dictionary dp where you store previously computed values of F as you traverse the sequence from top to bottom; this will allow you to avoid recomputing the same subproblems multiple times.

The updated function would look like this:

- Initialize a dictionary dp with default value infinity
- Define a recursive function f(i, prev_F):
  - If i is equal to n (length of the sequence), return prev_F
  - If dp[i][prev_F] has already been computed, return the stored value
  - Otherwise, calculate the minimum possible value of F for the current index and previous value using the transition relationship:
    * Initialize min_val = infinity
    * For each possible x_i and y_i (subject to the constraints):
      * Calculate the new value of F: prev_F + a_i * x_i + y_i * x_i
      * If this value is less than min_val, update min_val
    * Return dp[i][prev_F] = min_val

- Initialize the memoization dictionary with base case values (n, 0) -> 0

This plan seems correct and should work for solving the problem. It takes into account the constraints given in the problem statement and uses dynamic programming to avoid recomputing subproblems.
