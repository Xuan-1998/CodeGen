===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you start by solving smaller subproblems and gradually build up to the original problem.

Define the state as (i, k) where i is the current index from 2 to n and k is the sum of ai - s. The base case would be when i = 1, in which case the minimum value of F can be calculated by iterating over all possible values for y0 and x1 that satisfy x1 + y0 = a1.

Formulate state transition relationships using dynamic programming. For example, F(i, k) can be calculated as the minimum value of (x_i + a_i - s) * y_(i+1) + y_i * x_(i+1) + ... + y_(n-2) * x_(n-1) + y_(n-1) * a_n for i = 1 to n-1, and for each possible value of y_i.

Employ a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a table with base cases and then iteratively update the values using state transition relationships.

Fill in the missing states F(0, k) based on the original sequence ai and s. This can be done by iterating over all possible values for y0 that satisfy y0 + x1 = a1, and updating F(0, k) as the minimum value of (x_1 + a_1 - s) * y_(2) + y_1 * x_(2) + ... + y_(n-2) * x_(n-1) + y_(n-1) * a_n.

Handle edge cases for the base case F(0, k). For example, when ai = 0 or ai = s, you can directly calculate the value of F(i, k).

Initialize the table with base cases and then iteratively update the values using state transition relationships. This will allow you to efficiently calculate the minimum possible value of F for each test case.
