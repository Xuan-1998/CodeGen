===BEGIN PLAN===
Code a top-down recursive function that solves the problem using memoization
The state is the remaining numbers in the sequence and the current sum
The base case is when there are no more numbers left to consider
Apply dynamic programming with two states: one for including the current number in the sum, and another for excluding it
Use a dictionary as the memoization data structure
Initialize the dictionary before calling the recursive function
Update the dictionary with the results of each recursive call
When the base case is reached (no more numbers left), return the minimum value from the two states
Code the base case in terms of the minimum value
===END PLAN===
