===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you start by solving smaller subproblems and gradually build up to the original problem.

 Define the state as (i, k) where i is the current index from 2 to n and k is the sum of ai - s. The base case would be when i = 2, in which case the minimum value of F can be calculated by iterating over all possible values for y1 and x2 that satisfy x2 + y1 = a2.

 Define a function dp(i, k) to compute the minimum value for a given state (i, k). The recurrence relation would be: 
dp(i, k) = min(dp(i-1, k-a_i+s)+a_ia_i-x_is) for i > 2 and k >= s

 Populate the array by iterating over all possible values of k from 0 to a_n - s and updating dp(i, k) accordingly.

 Base case: when i = n, return dp(n, a_n - s)
