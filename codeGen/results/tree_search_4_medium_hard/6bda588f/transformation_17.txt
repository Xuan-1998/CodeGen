===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about applying memoization to a top-down recursive function that solves the problem
The state is a pair of integers (i, s) where i is the current index and s is the current sum. The base case is when i reaches n.

Consider defining states as a tuple of (i, j) where i is the current index and j is the current sum.
You can use dynamic programming with a 2D array where dp[i][s] represents the minimum F value when processing up to index i and sum s.

The updated state transition function would be:
dp[i][s] = min(dp[i-1][s-a_i] + a_i * x + y * (a_n - s), dp[i-1][s+a_i] + a_i * (n-i) + (n-i) * (n-i))

The base case is when i reaches n:
dp[n][s] = F(s, a_1, ..., a_n)

To avoid overflow issues, use long long to store the values in the dp array.

The initial value of dp[0][s] is infinity for all s, because we don't know what F is yet.
