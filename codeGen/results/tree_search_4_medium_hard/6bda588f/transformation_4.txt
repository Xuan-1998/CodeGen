===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you start by solving smaller subproblems and gradually build up to the original problem.

Define the state as (i, j) where i is the current index from 1 to n and j is the difference between ai and s. The base case would be when i = 1, in which case the minimum value of F can be calculated by iterating over all possible values for y1 and x1 that satisfy x1 + y1 = a1.

Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where you start by solving smaller subproblems (e.g., calculating the minimum value of F for i-1 and j-ai+i) and gradually build up to the original problem. The state could be represented as (i, j, k) where k is the current possible value of xi.

Use a dictionary memo to store the results of subproblems and update the solution by checking if the result is already calculated before recalculating it.

To avoid calculating the same subproblem multiple times, add a condition to check if the subproblem has been solved before. If not, calculate it and store the result in the dictionary.
