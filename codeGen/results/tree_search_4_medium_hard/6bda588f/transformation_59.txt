===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem could be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice
Let the state expression be (i, left_sum, right_sum) where i is the current index, left_sum is the sum of the first i integers, and right_sum is the sum of the remaining integers. The base case would be when i = 0 or i = n-1.
Consider a recursive function that takes as input the current index i, the sum of the first i integers (left_sum), and the sum of the remaining integers (right_sum). The base case would be when i = 0 or i = n-1. The transition relationships can be formulated by considering the minimum possible value of F for each subproblem.
Create a memoized function that utilizes a dictionary to store and retrieve previously computed values, allowing for efficient reuse of solutions to subproblems.

Modify the state expression to also include the current sum (left_sum + right_sum) as it affects the transition relationships.
Define the base cases more specifically: when i = 0, return 0; when i = n-1, calculate the minimum value of F by distributing a_n into x_i and y_i.
Update the recursive function to take into account the current sum and use the memoized values for previously computed subproblems.
