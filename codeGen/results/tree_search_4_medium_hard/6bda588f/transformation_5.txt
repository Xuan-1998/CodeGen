===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you start by solving smaller subproblems and gradually build up to the original problem.

 Define the state as (i, j) where i is the current index from 1 to n, j is the difference between ai and s, and ai-s is the current possible value. The base case would be when i = 1, in which case the minimum value of F can be calculated by considering all possible values for x1 and y1 that satisfy x1 + y1 = a1.

Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where you start by solving smaller subproblems (e.g., calculating the minimum value of F for i-1 and ai-s) and gradually build up to the original problem. The state could be represented as (i, j, k) where k is the current possible value of ai-s.

Create a 3D array dp of size n x max(2 * s, 10^5) x max(a_i, 10^5) to store the minimum value of F for each subproblem. Use the recurrence relation: dp[i][j][k] = min(dp[i-1][j'][k'] + (a_i - k') * (s-j')) for all possible values of j' and k', where k' is updated as ai-s.
