===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you start by solving smaller subproblems and gradually build up to the original problem.

 Define the state as (i, j) where i is the current index from 1 to n and j is the difference between ai and s. The base case would be when i = 1, in which case the minimum value of F can be calculated by iterating over all possible values for y1 and x1 that satisfy x1 + y1 = a1.

Formulate a dynamic programming approach that uses two arrays dp and dp_prev to keep track of the minimum values for subproblems. The transition relationship would involve calculating the minimum value for F when i-1 and j-ai+i, considering all possible values for xi.

Maintain a separate 1D array to store the cumulative sum of values in the 2D DP table, so that you can efficiently compute the minimum value for F by iterating from right to left and adding or subtracting the corresponding cumulative sum.

The updated plan includes edge cases by ensuring that the base case is handled correctly when i = 1. The dynamic programming approach also considers all possible values for xi, which should cover all possible combinations of x_i and y_i.

To improve the plan, consider using a more efficient data structure to store the DP table, such as a sparse array or a bit vector, if most entries in the table are zero. This could significantly reduce memory usage and computation time.

The potential issue with the plan is that it assumes the optimal value of xi for F can be calculated by iterating over all possible values for xi, which might not always be true. To address this, consider adding a constraint to the dynamic programming approach that ensures the selected xi is indeed the minimum one.
