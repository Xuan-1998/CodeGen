===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you start by solving smaller subproblems and gradually build up to the original problem.

 Define the state as (i, k) where i is the current index from 2 to n-1 and k is the sum of ai - s for i = 2 to n. The base case would be when i = 2, in which case the minimum value of F can be calculated by iterating over all possible values for yi and xi that satisfy xi + yi = ai.

State: (i, k) where i is the current index from 0 to n-1 and k is the sum of ai - s, for i = 2 to n-1, and for each possible value of yi.

Use a dictionary to store previously computed values to avoid redundant computation. Initialize dp with an empty dictionary.

The transition function can be calculated as follows:

dp[i][k] = min(dp[i-1][k]) + (a_i - s) if k >= 0
dp[i][k] = max(dp[i-1][k]) + (-s) if k < 0

Base case: dp[2][k] = min(a2 - k, -s + k)

Finally, return the minimum value of dp[n-1][sum(1 to n a_i) - s]

This approach ensures that all possible combinations of xi and yi are considered. It also takes advantage of previously computed values to avoid redundant computation.
