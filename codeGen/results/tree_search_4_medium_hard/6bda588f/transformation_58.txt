===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem could be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice.

Let the state expression be (i, left_sum, right_sum) where i is the current index, left_sum is the sum of the first i integers, and right_sum is the sum of the remaining integers. The base case would be when i = 0 or i = n-1.

Consider a recursive function that takes as input the current index i, the sum of the first i integers (left_sum), and the sum of the remaining integers (right_sum). The base case would be when i = 0 or i = n-1. The transition relationships can be formulated by considering the minimum possible value of F for each subproblem.

Consider using dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach to construct the solution from smaller instances. For each subproblem, calculate the minimum possible value of F and store it in a table dp[].

The updated state expression would be (i, left_sum, right_sum, s) where s is the current sum of the sequence. This allows us to track the sum of the remaining integers while still considering the condition (x_i - s) * (y_i - s) >= 0.

To calculate dp[i], consider two cases:

* If a_i <= s, then x_i = a_i and y_i = 0, which means F = a_i * x_(i+1) + y_(i+1) * x_(i+2) + ... + y_(n-1) * a_n.
* If a_i > s, then x_i = s and y_i = a_i - s. This ensures that (x_i - s) * (y_i - s) >= 0.

The minimum possible value of F would be the sum of the first i integers minus s times the remaining sum of the sequence, which is dp[i-1] - s * right_sum.

The final answer would be the minimum possible value of F for the last index n-1, which is dp[n-2].

The time complexity would be O(n), where n is the length of the sequence. The space complexity would be O(n) as well, since we need to store the state of each subproblem.
