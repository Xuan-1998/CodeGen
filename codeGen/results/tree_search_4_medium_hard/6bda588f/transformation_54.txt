===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem could be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice
The base case would be when n = 0, in which case F can only take a single value depending on the last integer in the sequence.
Formulate the state as (n, s) where n is the number of elements remaining to process and s is the shift value. The transition relationship would involve calculating F for the current state and updating the next state accordingly. We can keep track of the minimum possible F as we iterate through the states.

Function dp(n, s):
    if n == 0:
        return a[0]
    min_F = float('inf')
    for x in range(s+1):
        y = a[n-1] - x
        if (x-s)*(y-s) >= 0:
            F = x*y + dp(n-1, s)
            min_F = min(min_F, F)
    return min_F
