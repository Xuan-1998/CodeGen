===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem could be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice.

Let the state expression be (i, left_sum, right_sum) where i is the current index, left_sum is the sum of the first i integers, and right_sum is the sum of the remaining integers. The base case would be when i = 0 or i = n-1.

Let dp[i][k] represent the minimum possible value of F for the first i integers with the left_sum being k. The state expression would be (i, k) and the transition relationships can be formulated by considering the minimum possible value of F for each subproblem.

Create a 3D array dp where dp[i][j][k] represents the minimum possible value of F for the first i integers with the left_sum being j and right_sum being k. This would account for all possible ways to distribute the sum of the remaining integers among the x's and y's.

Transition relationships can be formulated as follows:

- If i is 0 or n-1, then dp[i][j][k] = a_j * (n-i) - s

- Else, dp[i][j][k] = min(dp[i-1][x+y][z+1] + y * (a_j-a_i)) for all x and y such that 0 <= x <= j and 0 <= y <= a_j-x-s

Initialize the base cases as follows:

dp[0][j][k] = a_j - s
dp[n-1][j][k] = a_n - s

Finally, the answer would be dp[n-1][0][a_0].
