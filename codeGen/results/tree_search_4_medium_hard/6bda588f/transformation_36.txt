===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming. Here's an updated and refined plan:

Think about applying memoization to a bottom-up dynamic programming function that solves the problem
The state is the current number in the sequence and the minimum possible value of F for the first i numbers in the sequence.
The base case is when the sequence is empty, at which point we return 0.

Build an array F[1...n] where F[i] represents the minimum possible value of F for the first i numbers in the sequence.
For each number from 2 to n:
    For each possible value of x_i and y_i (where x_i + y_i = a_i):
        Calculate the new value of F using the current value of F and the current values of x_i and y_i
        Update F[i] with the minimum value between its current value and the calculated new value

Return F[n]
