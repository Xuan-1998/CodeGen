===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem could be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice.

Let the state expression be (n, k) where n is the remaining number of integers to process and k is the current value of s. The goal is to minimize F = Σ (x_i * a_{i+1}) where x_i are non-negative integers that satisfy the conditions x_i + y_i = a_i and (x_i - k) * (y_i - k) ≥ 0.

To find the minimum possible value of F, we need to consider two cases:

- If n is odd, then a_n must be even. In this case, let y_{n-1} = a_n and x_{n-1} = 0.
- If n is even, then a_n must be odd. In this case, let x_{n-1} = a_n and y_{n-1} = 0.

The base case of the recursion would be when n is 0 or 1. In these cases, we can easily calculate F based on the given sequence.
