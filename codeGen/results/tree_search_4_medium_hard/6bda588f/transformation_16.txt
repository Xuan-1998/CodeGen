===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization.

Define a function dp(i, s) that returns the minimum possible value of F for the subsequence a_i, ..., a_n with sum s. 

Base case: when i reaches n, return 0 (since there are no more numbers to add).

Recursive case: consider two possibilities - either x_i = s or y_i = s.

If x_i = s, then dp(i + 1, s - a_i) would be the minimum possible value of F for the subsequence a_(i+1), ..., a_n with sum s - a_i. 

If y_i = s, then dp(i + 1, s) would be the minimum possible value of F for the subsequence a_(i+1), ..., a_n with sum s.

The minimum possible value of F is the minimum of these two possibilities.

To avoid recalculating the same values multiple times, use memoization by storing the results in a dictionary dp_dict. 

For each pair (i, s) in dp_dict, calculate dp(i, s) and store it in dp_dict.

Finally, return dp(1, sum(a_1, ..., a_n)) as the minimum possible value of F for the entire sequence.
