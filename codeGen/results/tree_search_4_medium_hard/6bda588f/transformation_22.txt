===BEGIN PLAN===
The goal is to minimize the function F = a1*x2+y2*x3+y3*x4+...+yn-2*xn-1+yn*an
where xi and yi are non-negative integers that satisfy the conditions xi+yi=ai and (xi-s)*(yi-s) >= 0

The plan is to use memoization on a top-down recursive function that solves the problem

State: (i, s) where i is the current index and s is the current sum
Base case: when i reaches n

Memoize computed values in a dictionary and return them if they are already in the dictionary
This ensures that we don't repeat computation for the same subproblem

Top-down approach:
For each pair (i, s), compute F(i, s) as the minimum of two possibilities:
1. xi*s + F(i+1, s+ai)
   - This represents choosing xi as the value to be used in the function
2. yi*(s-ai) + F(i+1, s-ai)
   - This represents choosing yi as the value to be used in the function

Choose the minimum of these two possibilities and memoize it for future use
Return the base case when i reaches n
The result is the minimized value of F
