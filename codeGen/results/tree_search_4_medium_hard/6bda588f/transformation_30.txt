===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming with memoization, we can start by defining our recursive function that calculates the minimum possible value of F for a given sequence and sum.

* Define dp as a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the minimum possible value of F for the first i numbers in the sequence and the current sum j.
* The base case is when there are no more numbers left to consider, so dp[n][s] would be the answer we're looking for (minimum possible value of F).
* Define two states: one for including the current number in the sum (dp[i-1][a_i-s]) and another for excluding it (dp[i-1][s]).
* Calculate these two states using the following equations:
  - Including the current number: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][a_i-s] + a_i, dp[i-1][j])
  - Excluding the current number: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][s], dp[i-1][j])
* The final answer would be the minimum of these two states.
* Start from the smallest subproblem and build up to the original problem using a bottom-up approach.
