===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem could be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice.

The base case would be when n = 1, in which case F can only take a single value depending on the last integer in the sequence.
Formulate the state as a tuple (n, s) where n is the current number of elements in the sequence, s is the current shift value, and F is the minimum possible value of F that has been achieved so far.

The transition relationship would be when we consider a new element in the sequence and update our current state accordingly. This can be done by recursively calculating the optimal values for the sub-problems and updating our current state based on these calculated values.
Memoizing with recursive function using memoization dictionary to store previously computed values, which helps avoid redundant computations.

The updated plan also includes edge cases where n = 1, in which case F is simply equal to the last integer in the sequence.
