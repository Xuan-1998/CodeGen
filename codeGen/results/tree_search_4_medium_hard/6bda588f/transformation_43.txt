===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem could be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice.

Let the state expression be (n, s, prefix_sum) where n is the remaining number of integers to process, s is the current value of s, and prefix_sum is the sum of the first i integers in the sequence. This state captures all the necessary information needed to compute the minimum possible value of F.

Let dp[i][j] represent the minimum value of F when processing the first i integers and s is j. The base case would be when n = 0, where F = 0. For larger values of n, consider two possibilities: either x_i = a_i - s or y_i = a_i - s. This leads to recursive calls dp[i-1][s] and dp[i-1][j], respectively.

To avoid redundant computation, store the results in a table before computing them. This is particularly useful when dealing with overlapping subproblems. In this case, since we're processing integers up to n and values of s up to 2*10^5, we can use a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (s+1).

The recurrence relation would be:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][max(0, j-a_i)]) + max(0, j-a_i)*a_i

Here's how the code would look like:
