The optimal approach would be to break down the problem into smaller instances using dynamic programming with bottom-up tabulation. Here's an improved and detailed plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
Let the state expression be (n, prefix_sum) where n is the remaining number of integers to process and prefix_sum is the sum of the first i integers in the sequence.

The base case would be when n = 1, in which case F = a_1 * x_2 + y_2 * a_2. To minimize this value, we can set x_2 = s and y_2 = a_1 - s, resulting in F = a_1 * s.

For the recursive case, let's consider minimizing F when processing i integers. This can be broken down into two cases: either x_i = s or y_i = s. Without loss of generality, assume x_i = s. Then, we have:

F = prefix_sum + y_{i-1} * a_i - s

To minimize this value, set y_{i-1} = a_i - s, resulting in F = prefix_sum.

Now, let's update the dynamic programming array dp where dp[i] represents the minimum value of F when processing the first i integers. The base case is dp[1] = a_1 * s. For the recursive case:

dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], prefix_sum)

This approach would require O(n) space complexity.
