===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem could be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice.

The base case would be when n = 0, in which case F can only take a single value depending on the last integer in the sequence. This is because there are no more elements to process and thus no way to split the last element.

The state could be formulated as (n, s, a_n) where n is the number of elements remaining to process, s is the current target sum, and a_n is the last element in the sequence. The transition relationship would involve calculating F for the current state by considering all possible ways to split the last element into x_i and y_i that satisfy (x_i - s) * (y_i - s) >= 0, and updating the next state accordingly.

To avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency, we can employ memoization using a dictionary to store and reuse previously calculated values of F for the same state.

The plan could be further improved by considering edge cases, such as when n = 1 or n = 2. In these cases, the optimal value of F would be simply the last element in the sequence, since there are no more elements to process.
