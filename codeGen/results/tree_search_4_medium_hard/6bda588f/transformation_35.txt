===BEGIN PLAN===
Code a recursive function that calculates F recursively based on the current number in the sequence and the previous value of F.

Define a dynamic programming array dp of size n+1 where dp[i] will store the minimum possible value of F for the first i numbers in the sequence.

The base case is when the sequence is empty (i.e., i == 0), in which case F = 0. The initial state is dp[0] = 0, indicating that F is minimized to 0 when there are no numbers in the sequence.

For each number a_i in the sequence, calculate F for this number and the previous F value by trying different values of x_i and y_i that satisfy the conditions (x_i + y_i == a_i) and ((x_i - s) * (y_i - s) >= 0).

The dynamic programming state is dp[i] = min(F for all possible values of x_i and y_i such that (x_i + y_i == a_i)) + a_i.

Memoize the dynamic programming solution using a top-down recursive function with state (current number in the sequence, previous value of F) and base case when the sequence is empty.
