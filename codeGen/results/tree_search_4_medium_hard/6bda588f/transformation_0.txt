===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you start by solving smaller subproblems and gradually build up to the original problem.

 Define the state as (i, j) where i is the current index from 1 to n and j is the difference between ai and s. The base case would be when i = 1, in which case the minimum value of F can be calculated by iterating over all possible values for y1 and x1 that satisfy x1 + y1 = a1.

 Define another state as (i-1, k) where k is the difference between ai-1 and s. This represents the optimal solution for the subproblem (i-1).

The transition relation would be F(i, j) = min(F(i-1, k)) over all possible values of k that satisfy x + y = ai and j - k >= 0.

Use a 2D array dp to store the minimum value of F at each state (i, j). Initialize the first row as follows: dp[0][j] = aj for all j. This represents the base case where i = 1.

Fill up the dp table in bottom-up manner by iterating over all possible values of i and j. For each cell dp[i][j], calculate the minimum value of F that satisfies the state (i, j) using the transition relation defined above.

The final answer would be dp[n-1][s-a_n].

This plan correctly solves the problem using dynamic programming. It's a good start, but it can be improved by considering some edge cases. For example, when i = 1 and j < 0, we should return infinity or a very large number to represent an impossible solution.
