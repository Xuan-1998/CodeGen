===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you start by solving smaller subproblems and gradually build up to the original problem.

 Define the state as (i, k) where i is the current index from 2 to n-1 and k is the sum of ai - s. The base case would be when i = 2, in which case the minimum value of F can be calculated by iterating over all possible values for yi that satisfy yi + xi = ai.

State: (i, k) where i is the current index from 0 to n-1 and k is the sum of ai - s, for i = 2 to n-1, and for each possible value of yi.

Create a 2D array dp of size (n-1) x (2*s+1) to store the minimum values for each state (i, k). Use the previous values to calculate the current value.

Initialize the base case dp[0][k] = min(a1 - s, ai - s) for k in range(2*s+1).

For i from 1 to n-2:

    For k from 0 to 2*s:
        Calculate the minimum value of F by iterating over all possible values for yi that satisfy yi + xi = ai.
        Update dp[i][k] with the calculated minimum value.

Return dp[n-2][k] where k is the sum of an - s, which represents the minimum possible value of F.
