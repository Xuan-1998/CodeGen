===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you start by solving smaller subproblems and gradually build up to the original problem.

 Define the state as (i, j) where i is the current index from 1 to n and j is the difference between ai and s. The base case would be when i = 1, in which case the minimum value of F can be calculated by iterating over all possible values for y1 and x1 that satisfy x1 + y1 = a1.

Formulate a dynamic programming approach that uses two arrays dp and dp_prev to keep track of the minimum values for subproblems. The transition relationship would involve calculating the minimum value for F when i-1 and j-ai+i, considering all possible values for xi.

Create a 2D DP table with dimensions (n+1) x (s+1), where dp[i][j] represents the minimum value of F when i indices are processed and j is the difference between ai and s.

For each cell in the DP table, calculate the minimum value by iterating over all possible values for yi and xi that satisfy yi + xi = ai and xi - s >= 0. The minimum value would be the sum of the product of xi and x(i+1) plus the minimum value at dp[i-1][j-ai+i].
