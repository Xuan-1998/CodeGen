===BEGIN PLAN===
The goal is to find the minimum possible value of F that is defined as follows: 

F = a1 * x2 + y2 * x3 + y3 * x4 + ... + yn-2 * xn-1 + yn-1 * an,

where xi and yi are non-negative integers that satisfy the conditions xi + yi = ai and (xi - s) * (yi - s) â‰¥ 0.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with memoization. 

The state is the previous value of F and the current number in the sequence. The base case is when the sequence is empty.

Top-down recursive function:
- Base case: When the sequence is empty, return 0.
- Recursive case: For each ai in the sequence, consider two possibilities:
    * xi = s + yi (yi = ai - s) => F = Fprev + ai * s
    * xi = s - yi (yi = ai - s) => F = Fprev - ai * s
  Choose the minimum of these two values and return it.
- Memoization: Store the results of subproblems in a memo array to avoid redundant computation.

Memoizing the dynamic programming solution:
- Initialize a memo array with size n+1, where n is the length of the sequence.
- For each ai in the sequence, calculate the minimum possible value of F and store it in the memo array.
- Return the last element of the memo array, which represents the minimum possible value of F for the entire sequence.
