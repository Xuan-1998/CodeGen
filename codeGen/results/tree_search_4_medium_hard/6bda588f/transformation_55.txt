===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem could be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice
The base case would be when n = 1, in which case F can only take a single value depending on the last integer in the sequence.
The state could be formulated as (n, s, a_n) where n is the number of elements remaining to process, s is the target value, and a_n is the last element in the sequence. The transition relationship would involve calculating F for the current state by considering all possible ways to split the last element into x_i and y_i, and updating the next state accordingly.
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach to fill up a 3D table where each cell represents the minimum possible value of F for the given sequence up to that point. The table would be populated in a manner such that each cell's value is dependent on the values of cells representing smaller instances of itself, ensuring the optimal substructure property holds.
The final answer would be stored in the top-right cell of the 3D table, which represents the minimum possible value of F for the entire sequence.
