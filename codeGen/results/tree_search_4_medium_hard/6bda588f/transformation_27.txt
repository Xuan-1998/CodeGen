===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][k] will store the minimum value that can be obtained with a sum k and i numbers left.
The base case is when there are no more numbers left (i = 0), in which case dp[i][k] = 0
For each number a in the sequence:
- Try to put s into the current term: dp[i - 1][k + a - 2s]
- Don't put s into the current term: dp[i - 1][k + a]

The final answer will be dp[n][sum(a) - n*s]
This way, we are considering all possible ways to distribute the numbers and s in the sequence
