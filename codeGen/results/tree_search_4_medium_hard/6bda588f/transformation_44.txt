===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem could be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice.

Let the state expression be (n, prefix_sum) where n is the remaining number of integers to process and prefix_sum is the sum of the first i integers in the sequence. This can help us avoid recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.

The goal is to minimize F = Σ (x_i * a_{i+1}) + y_{n-1} * a_n, where x_i and y_i are non-negative integers that satisfy the conditions x_i + y_i = a_i and (x_i - s) * (y_i - s) ≥ 0.

Implement memoization by defining a recursive function that uses dictionary memo to store previously computed values. The key would be a tuple (n, prefix_sum) and the value would be the minimum possible F.

To minimize F, we need to consider two cases: either the current integer is included in the sum or it's not. If the current integer is included, then x_i will be the maximum value that doesn't exceed s, and y_i will be a_i - x_i. If the current integer is not included, then x_{i+1} will be the maximum value that doesn't exceed s, and y_{i+1} will be a_{i+1}. This can help us avoid considering non-optimal solutions.

The base case for the recursion would be when n is 0 or 1. In this case, F can simply be calculated as prefix_sum * (prefix_sum - s) if n is even, and 0 otherwise.

Return memoized value from the dictionary to avoid redundant computation.
