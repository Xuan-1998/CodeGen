===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you start by solving smaller subproblems and gradually build up to the original problem.

Define the state as (i, j) where i is the current index from 1 to n and j is the difference between ai and s. The base case would be when i = 1, in which case the minimum value of F can be calculated by iterating over all possible values for y1 and x1 that satisfy x1 + y1 = a1.

The recursive relation can be defined as: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + ai*x + (a_i - s - k) * x) where i is the current index, j is the difference between ai and s, and x is the value that minimizes F.

Tabulation using a 2D array where the indices represent the difference between ai and s. The base case would be when i = 1, in which case the minimum value of F can be calculated by iterating over all possible values for y1 and x1 that satisfy x1 + y1 = a1.

Fill up the dp array based on the recursive relation. Then, return dp[n-1][j] as the final result.
