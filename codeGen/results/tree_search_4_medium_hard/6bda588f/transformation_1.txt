===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you start by solving smaller subproblems and gradually build up to the original problem.

Define the state as (i, j) where i is the current index from 1 to n and j is the difference between ai and s. The base case would be when i = 1, in which case the minimum value of F can be calculated by iterating over all possible values for y1 and x1 that satisfy x1 + y1 = a1.

Memoization using a dictionary where the key is a tuple representing the state (i, j) and the value is the minimum value of F for that state.

For each subproblem, iterate from 0 to aj - s to find the minimum value of F. If aj > s, then consider two cases: aj - s or aj - s + 1. Choose the one with a smaller minimum value of F.

To improve the plan, you could optimize the memoization by only storing the states that are actually visited during the computation.

The potential issue with the plan is that it might not be efficient enough due to the large number of possible subproblems.

The plan does include edge cases such as when i = 1 and aj < s or ai > s, in which case you can directly calculate the minimum value of F without iterating over all possible values for y1 and x1.
