===== BEGIN PLAN =====
Let's break down the plan step by step:

* We can use memoization to avoid recomputing solutions for subproblems. 
  This is because we are trying to find the minimum possible value of F, which means that once we've found a solution for a given (i, s), it won't change.
  
* The state will be a triple (i, j, k) where i is the current index, j is the current sum, and k is whether we have used s in this path or not.
  We'll initialize dp[0][0][False] to 0 because at the beginning there's no number selected yet.

* The base case will be when i reaches n. At that point, we just need to add up all the numbers left and return it as the minimum possible value of F.

* To fill in dp[i][j][k], we can use a similar approach to the one used in 0/1 knapsack problem.
  If k is False, then we either select the current number if j + a[i] <= s, or we don't select it. 
  In the first case, we add the value of the current number and recursively call dp[i+1][j+a[i]][True].
  In the second case, we just recursively call dp[i+1][j][k].

* If k is True, then we only have two options: either select the current number if j + a[i] <= s, or don't select it.
  So we add up the value of the current number and recursively call dp[i+1][j+a[i]][True], 
  or we just recursively call dp[i+1][j][k].

* To find the minimum possible value of F for each test case, we'll initialize min_val = 2 * 10^5.
  Then we'll iterate over all numbers from s to a[n] and update min_val if necessary.
