===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem can be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice for solving it dynamically.

The base case would be when n = 0, in which case F can only take a single value depending on the last integer in the sequence. In this case, F is simply equal to that integer.

The state could be formulated as (n, s, a_n) where n is the number of elements remaining to process, s is the target sum, and a_n is the last element in the sequence. The transition relationship would involve calculating F for the current state by considering all possible ways to split the last element into x_i and y_i that satisfy the given condition (x_i + y_i = a_i and (x_i - s) * (y_i - s) >= 0).

To avoid redundant calculations, we can implement top-down memoization by recursively calculating values of F and storing them in a cache.

For each state, we consider all possible splits of the last element into x_i and y_i. For each split, we calculate F for the next state (n-1, s, x_i) or (n-1, s, y_i), depending on which one results in a smaller value of F. We then update the cache with the minimum value of F found so far.

Finally, we return the minimum value of F calculated for the initial state (n, s, a_1).
