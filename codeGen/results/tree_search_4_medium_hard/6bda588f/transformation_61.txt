===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem could be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice
Let the state expression be (i, left_sum, right_sum) where i is the current index, left_sum is the sum of the first i integers, and right_sum is the sum of the remaining integers. The base case would be when i = 0 or i = n-1.
Define a dynamic programming table dp where dp[i][k] represents the minimum possible value of F for the first i integers and k is either 0 (left_sum) or 1 (right_sum). The state expression would be (i, k) and the transition relationships can be formulated by considering the minimum possible value of F for each subproblem.

Update dp[i][k] as follows:
- If k = 0, then left_sum + a_i * min(x_n - s, y_n - s)
- If k = 1, then right_sum + a_n * min(x_n - s, y_n - s)

Apply memoization to a recursive function that computes the minimum possible value of F by storing intermediate results in a dictionary.
The base case would be when i = 0 or i = n-1.

Finally, return dp[n-1][0] as the minimum possible value of F
