===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you start by solving smaller subproblems and gradually build up to the original problem.

 Define the state as (i, k) where i is the current index from 2 to n and k is the sum of ai - s. The base case would be when i = 2, in which case the minimum value of F can be calculated by iterating over all possible values for y1 and x2 that satisfy x2 + y1 = a2.

Use dynamic programming to compute the minimum value F(i, k) by iterating over all possible values of xi and yi that satisfy xi + yi = ai, for i = 2 to n. Then use these computed values to calculate the minimum value F(n-1, k) as the sum of the minimum values F(i-1, k-ai-s) + ai - s for i = 3 to n.

Employ a bottom-up approach by solving smaller subproblems and gradually building up the solution.

For edge cases, consider handling when n is 2 or less (since there are no subproblems), or when s is equal to ai for any index i (in which case the minimum value F is simply the sum of all ai).
