===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem could be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice.

Let the state expression be (n, s, prefix_sum) where n is the remaining number of integers to process, s is the current value of s, and prefix_sum is the sum of the first i integers in the sequence.

Create a dynamic programming table with dimensions n+1, s+1, and max(a_i)+1 to store the minimum value of F for each state (n, s, prefix_sum).

For each cell dp[n][s][prefix_sum], calculate the minimum value of F by considering two options:
- Consider x_i as s and y_i as a_i - s. This corresponds to the case where the current integer is less than or equal to s.
- Consider y_i as s and x_i as a_i - s. This corresponds to the case where the current integer is greater than s.

Update dp[n][s][prefix_sum] with the minimum value of F obtained from these two options.

Finally, return dp[0][s][0], which represents the minimum value of F for the entire sequence.
