===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem could be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice
Let the state expression be (i, left_sum, right_sum) where i is the current index, left_sum is the sum of the first i integers, and right_sum is the sum of the remaining integers. The base case would be when i = 0 or i = n-1.
Let dp[i][k] represent the minimum possible value of F for the first i integers with the left_sum being k. The state expression would be (i, k) and the transition relationships can be formulated by considering the minimum possible value of F for each subproblem.

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, initializing an empty 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum possible value of F for the first i integers with the left_sum being j. For each cell in the dp array, consider all possible values of x and y that satisfy the conditions:
- (x - s) * (y - s) >= 0
- x + y = a_i

For each valid pair of x and y, calculate the value F and update the dp[i][k] with the minimum value.

The final answer would be dp[n-1][left_sum].
