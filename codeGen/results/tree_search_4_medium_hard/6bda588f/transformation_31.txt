===BEGIN PLAN===
The state is the current index i and the previous value of F.
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where 
the transition relationship can be formulated by updating 
the minimum possible value of F for each index.

dp[i][prev] = min(F(x, y)) for all x + y = ai
where prev = (x - s) * (y - s) >= 0

Let's start with initializing the dp table. We need to consider all possible pairs of x and y that add up to ai.
For each index i and previous value prev,
- if i is the last index, then we just need to check if ai is less than or equal to s. If it is, then F = 0 because x + y = ai and (x - s) * (y - s) >= 0
- otherwise, for each possible pair of x and y,
  - calculate the value of F for this pair 
  - update dp[i][prev] with the minimum of its current value and F

Finally, return dp[n-1][0] as the answer. This is because we want to find the minimum possible value of F considering all pairs of numbers from the sequence.
