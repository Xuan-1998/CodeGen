===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem could be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice.

Let the state expression be (n, s) where n is the remaining number of integers to process and s is the current value of s. The goal is to minimize F = Σ (x_i * a_{i+1}) where x_i are non-negative integers that satisfy the conditions x_i + y_i = a_i and (x_i - s) * (y_i - s) ≥ 0.

Let dp[i][s] be the minimum possible value of F for the first i integers, given that the current value of s is s. Then, we have:

dp[1][s] = a_1

For i > 1, we have:

dp[i][s] = min(dp[i-1][s-a_{i-1} + (a_{i-1} - s)], dp[i-1][s])

This is because if x_{i-1} = a_{i-1} and y_{i-1} = 0, then F will be minimized when s is set to a_{i-1}, so we update the state to (n-1, s-a_{i-1}) + (a_{i-1} - s). If x_{i-1} = 0 and y_{i-1} = a_{i-1}, then F will be minimized when s is not updated, so we keep the state as (n-1, s).

Finally, the answer is dp[n][s].
