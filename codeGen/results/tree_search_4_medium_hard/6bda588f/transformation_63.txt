===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem could be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice.
Let the state expression be (i, left_sum, right_sum) where i is the current index, left_sum is the sum of the first i integers, and right_sum is the sum of the remaining integers. The base case would be when i = 0 or i = n-1.

Initially, dp[i][k] could represent the minimum possible value of F for the first i integers with the left_sum being k.
However, this state expression can be simplified to just (i, k) as we only care about the current index and the sum of the first i integers.

Memoize function calls by storing previous computations in a dictionary and checking if the result is already computed before recalculating it.
To do this efficiently, sort the input array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n in descending order. This is because we want to minimize F, which means we want to minimize the product of x_i and y_i.

Let dp[i][k] represent the minimum possible value of F for the first i integers with the left_sum being k.
The transition relationships can be formulated by considering the minimum possible value of F for each subproblem:
dp[i][k] = min((k - s) * (a_i - s) + dp[i-1][k-a_i], (s-k) * (a_i-s) + dp[i-1][k+a_i])

This plan considers edge cases such as when i = 0 or i = n-1.
