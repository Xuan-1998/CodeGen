===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem can be broken down into smaller instances of itself, making a recursive function a suitable choice.

Let the state expression be (n, k) where n is the remaining number of integers to process and k is the current value of s. The goal is to minimize F = Σ (x_i * a_{i+1}) where x_i are non-negative integers that satisfy the conditions x_i + y_i = a_i and (x_i - k) * (y_i - k) ≥ 0.

Memoization-based Iterative Solution:
 Initialize a memo array of size n, with values initially set to infinity.
 Define a recursive function f(n, k) that calculates the minimum F value for the given state. The base case is when n = 1, in which case the function returns 0.
 For each possible x_i from 0 to k, calculate the corresponding y_i and update the memo array with the minimum F value for the subproblem (n-1, k-x_i).
 Use dynamic programming to fill up the memo array iteratively.
