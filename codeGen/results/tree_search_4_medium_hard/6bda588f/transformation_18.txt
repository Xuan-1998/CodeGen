===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider defining states as a tuple of (i, s) where i is the current index and j is the current sum. This state captures the information needed to calculate the minimum F value for this position.

Create a memoized function that takes two parameters: the current index i and the current sum s. The function will return the minimum F value for this state, and it will store the results in a dictionary to avoid repeated calculations.

The base case is when i reaches n. At this point, we can simply return 0 as there are no more numbers to add to the sum.

In each recursive call, calculate the two possible values of F: one where we include the current number (a_i) and one where we don't. The minimum value between these two options is the result for this state.

Store the results in a dictionary to avoid repeated calculations.

The function will have two variables: dp and prev_sum. dp[i][s] will store the minimum F value that can be achieved with sum s at index i, and prev_sum[s] will store the last number that was added to get sum s.

At the end of the function, return the result stored in dp[n-1][s].
