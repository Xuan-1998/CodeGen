===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where you start by solving smaller subproblems and gradually build up to the original problem.

Define the state as (i, j) where i is the current index from 1 to n and j is the difference between ai and s. The base case would be when i = 1, in which case the minimum value of F can be calculated by iterating over all possible values for y1 and x1 that satisfy x1 + y1 = a1.

Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where you start by solving smaller subproblems (e.g., calculating the minimum value of F for i-1 and j-ai+i) and gradually build up to the original problem. The state could be represented as (i, j, k) where k is the current possible value of xi.

Create a 3D array dp of size n x max(2 * s, 10^5) x (max(a1, 2 * s)) to store the minimum value of F for each subproblem and use the recurrence relation: 
dp[i][j][k] = min(dp[i-1][l][m] + (a_i - m) * (s-j)) for all possible values of l and m that satisfy xi-yi=ai-k
