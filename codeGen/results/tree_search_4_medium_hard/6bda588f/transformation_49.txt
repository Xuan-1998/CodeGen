===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure of this problem can be broken down into smaller instances of itself by considering a recursive function that calculates the minimum value of F for a given sequence and shift.

The base case would be when n = 0, in which case F can only take a single value depending on the last integer in the sequence. This is because there are no more elements to consider or shift values to update.

Formulate the state as a tuple (n, s, F) where n is the current number of elements in the sequence, s is the current shift value, and F is the minimum possible value of F that has been achieved so far. The transition relationship would be when we consider a new element in the sequence and update our current state accordingly.

Memoizing with dynamic programming by creating a 3D table dp[][][][] where dp[i][j][k] is the minimum value of F for a sequence of length i, shift j, and considering k as the last integer in the sequence. This ensures that we do not recompute the same subproblem multiple times.

The recursive function would be: 
dp[n][s][a] = min(dp[i][s-1][b] + (a-i)*(a-b) for i from 0 to a and b from i to a)
