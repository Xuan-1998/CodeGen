===BEGIN PLAN===
Let's analyze the plan step by step:
1. Think about applying memoization to a top-down recursive function that solves the problem:
   - This is a good starting point, as memoization can be effective in reducing computational complexity for problems with overlapping subproblems.

2. The state is the previous value of F and the current number in the sequence.
   - This makes sense, as we need to keep track of the previous values of F to compute the minimum possible value of F for each index.

3. The base case is when the sequence is empty:
   - A good choice, as this would terminate the recursion or iteration, allowing us to return a result or handle edge cases.

4. Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where the state is the current index i and the previous value of F.
   - This could be an effective way to solve the problem, especially if we can formulate a transition relationship that updates the minimum possible value of F for each index.

5. Use a combination of memoization and iteration to solve the problem:
   - This approach seems reasonable, as combining memoization with iteration can help reduce computational complexity further.
