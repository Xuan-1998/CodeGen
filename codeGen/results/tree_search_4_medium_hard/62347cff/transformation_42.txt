===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the overlapping subproblems by recognizing that the minimum path sum for each cell depends on its neighbors. Use tabulation to store and reuse these calculations.

The state expression is:
  dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

If we reach the top row (i == 0) or the leftmost column (j == 0), we can use the following base cases to initialize the dp table:

dp[0][j] = dp[0][0] if j > 0 else grid[0][0]
dp[i][0] = dp[0][0] if i > 0 else grid[0][0]

The final answer is stored in dp[m-1][n-1], where m and n are the dimensions of the input grid.
