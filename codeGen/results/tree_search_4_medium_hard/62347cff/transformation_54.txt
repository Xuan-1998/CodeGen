===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the overlapping subproblems by recognizing that the minimum path sum for each cell depends on its neighbors. Use tabulation to store and reuse these calculations.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(sum of all values above and to the left of (i, j)) + grid[i][j].
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

Use dynamic programming with memoization by defining a function that calculates the minimum path sum for a given cell (i, j). The function should check if the result is already stored in the memo dictionary before calculating it. This way, you avoid recalculating the same values multiple times.

After calculating the minimum path sum for each cell, return dp[m-1][n-1] as the final answer.

Initialize dp and memo with zeros.

For i from 0 to m-1:
    For j from 0 to n-1:
        If i == 0 or j == 0: // base case
            dp[i][j] = grid[i][j]
        Else:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

Return dp[m-1][n-1]
