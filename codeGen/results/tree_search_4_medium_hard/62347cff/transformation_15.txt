===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i][j] be the minimum path sum up to cell (i, j). The base case is when i or j reaches 0.
The state is the cell (i, j) and the transition relation is:
    if i == 0 and j > 0: dp[0][j] = grid[0][j]
    if i > 0 and j == 0: dp[i][0] = grid[i][0]
    else: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
Use dynamic programming with a 2D array to store the minimum path sums, where each cell's value is the minimum sum of all numbers along its path from top left to that cell.
