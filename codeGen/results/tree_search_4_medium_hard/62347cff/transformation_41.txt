===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure can be defined as the minimum sum of a single cell being either from above (top-down) or from left (bottom-up).
Let dp[i][j] be the minimum sum of all numbers along a path ending at cell [i][j]. The base case is when i is 0 or j is 0, which means we've reached the top or left boundary.
For each cell, there are two possibilities: either come from above (dp[i-1][j]) or from left (dp[i][j-1]), and the state expression is the minimum of these two values plus the value at the current cell.

The state can be formulated as:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

Use a list of lists to store the dynamic programming table, with each inner list representing a row in the grid.
Initialize the first row and column with their respective values from the top or left boundary.

The plan seems correct, but it's worth noting that the state expression should be updated as follows:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

This is because we want to consider both possibilities (coming from above and coming from left) and choose the minimum sum.

The plan does include edge cases, as it correctly handles the base case when i or j is 0. It also accounts for all cells in the grid.
