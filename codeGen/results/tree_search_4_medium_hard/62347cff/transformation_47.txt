===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the overlapping subproblems by recognizing that the minimum path sum for each cell depends on its neighbors. Use tabulation to store and reuse these calculations.
The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j].
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
Utilize a bottom-up approach by initializing the first row and column of the dp array, then iterating through the rest of the grid to update the minimum path sum.
Use dynamic programming to store the intermediate results in a table (dp) and use them to avoid redundant calculations. The base cases are the cells along the border of the grid.
Start from the top-left corner and move right or down for each cell, considering the minimum value of its upper neighbor and left neighbor, respectively. If you have already calculated the values for these neighbors, simply add the current cell's value to the minimum value.
The final answer will be stored in dp[m-1][n-1], where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.
