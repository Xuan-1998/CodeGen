===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the overlapping subproblems by recognizing that the minimum path sum for each cell depends on its neighbors. 
Use tabulation to store and reuse these calculations.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j].

for each cell, calculate the minimum path sum by considering its neighbors: top and left for non-boundary cells, only one neighbor for boundary cells.

Use dynamic programming to fill in the dp array from top left to bottom right. 

At the end, return dp[m-1][n-1] as it represents the minimum path sum.

The plan includes edge cases: 
- The initial state is initialized with all values as infinity except the first cell which is 0.
- The base case for boundary cells is correctly handled.

To improve the plan:
- Add a check to ensure that the input grid is within the allowed size constraint (200x200).

Potential issues with the plan:
- What if the input grid has negative numbers?
- Are there any special cases that need to be handled, like what happens when the starting cell or ending cell is on the edge?
