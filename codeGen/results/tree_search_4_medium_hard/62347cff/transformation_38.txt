===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure can be defined as the minimum sum of a single cell being either from above (top-down) or from left (bottom-up).
Let dp[i][j] be the minimum sum of all numbers along a path ending at cell [i][j]. The base case is when i is 0 or j is 0, which means we've reached the top or left boundary. For each cell, there are two possibilities: either come from above (dp[i-1][j]) or from left (dp[i][j-1]), and the state expression is the minimum of these two values plus the value at the current cell.
The state can be formulated as dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j];
Use a recursive function with memoization to store the calculated values in a dictionary, which can be accessed whenever a cell is visited again.
