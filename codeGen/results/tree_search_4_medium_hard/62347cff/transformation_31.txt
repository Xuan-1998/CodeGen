===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure can be defined as the minimum sum of a single cell being either from above (top-down) or from left (bottom-up).
dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of all numbers along a path ending at cell [i][j]. The base case is when i or j is equal to 0, meaning we've reached the top or left boundary. For each cell, there are two possibilities: either come from above (dp[max(0, i-1)][j]) or from left (dp[i][max(0, j-1)]).
To avoid index out of bounds errors, use max(0, i-1) and max(0, j-1) to ensure that the indices are within the valid range.
dp[i][j] = min(dp[max(0, i-1)][j], dp[i][max(0, j-1)]) + grid[i][j]
Create a 2D array dp of size (m+1) x (n+1) filled with the maximum possible integer value (e.g., INT_MAX in C++) to represent the minimum sum at each cell.
For edge cases, consider initializing the first row and first column of the dp array with the corresponding grid values, since there's only one way to reach those cells.
