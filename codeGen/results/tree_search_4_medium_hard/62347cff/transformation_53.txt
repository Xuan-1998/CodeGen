===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the overlapping subproblems by recognizing that the minimum path sum for each cell depends on its neighbors. Use tabulation to store and reuse these calculations.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(sum of all values above and to the left of (i, j)) + grid[i][j].
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

Use a 2D array to store the minimum path sums for each cell, and initialize all values to infinity (or a large number). Then, update the dp array row by row from top to bottom, and column by column from left to right. This way, you ensure that when updating the value of dp[i][j], all necessary calculations have been done on its neighbors.

The plan is correct, but it can be improved by initializing the first row and first column with values from the grid, since these cells only depend on their neighbors (either above or to the left). This reduces the number of unnecessary calculations.

The plan also correctly identifies edge cases. For example, when updating the value of dp[i][j], it ensures that all necessary calculations have been done on its neighbors, including the top and left boundaries.
