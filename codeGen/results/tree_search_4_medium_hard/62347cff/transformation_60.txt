===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the overlapping subproblems by recognizing that the minimum path sum for each cell depends on its neighbors. Use tabulation to store and reuse these calculations.

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum sum of all numbers along a path from the top left corner to cell (i, j). Then the base case is when i or j equals 0, in which case the minimum sum is simply the value at cell (i, j).

dp[i][j] depends on the values in dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1], with the minimum path sum for each cell being the sum of its own value and the minimum of the sums above and to the left.

Use a 2D array, dp, to store the calculated values of the minimum path sum for each cell. Initialize dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] to be the corresponding row and column in the input grid, since there are no neighbors at these cells. Then iteratively fill in dp[i][j] based on its dependencies.

To avoid overwriting previously calculated values, fill the dp array from top to bottom and left to right (since each cell depends only on the cells directly above and to the left).

Finally, return dp[m-1][n-1], which represents the minimum sum of all numbers along the path from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.
