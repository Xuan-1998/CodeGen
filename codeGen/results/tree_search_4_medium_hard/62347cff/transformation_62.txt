===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the overlapping subproblems by recognizing that the minimum path sum for each cell depends on its neighbors. 
Use tabulation to store and reuse these calculations.
Let dp[i][j] be the minimum sum of all numbers along a path from the top left corner to cell (i, j). Then the base case is when i or j equals 0, in which case the minimum sum is simply the value at cell (i, j).
dp[i][j] depends on the values in dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1], with the minimum path sum for each cell being the sum of its own value and the minimum of the sums above and to the left.
The plan looks correct. It correctly identifies the dynamic programming nature of the problem, and defines the base case and recurrence relation correctly.

Tabulate the solution using a nested loop, iterating over the rows and columns of the grid.
