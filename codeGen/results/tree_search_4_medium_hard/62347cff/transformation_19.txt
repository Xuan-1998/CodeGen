===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify the minimum path sum as the optimal substructure, and use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j].

The dynamic programming state dp[i][j] represents the minimum path sum up to cell (i, j), and the transition relationship is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j].

You can consider using a matrix with extra rows or columns at the top and left sides to simplify the base cases for the recursive function.

The initial state dp[0][0] will be set to the value of the top-left cell in the grid. Then, iteratively update dp[i][j] based on its neighboring cells and the transition relationship until reaching the bottom-right cell.

Finally, return dp[m-1][n-1] as the minimum path sum from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.
