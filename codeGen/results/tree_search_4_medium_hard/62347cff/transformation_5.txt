===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j];
Identify the minimum path sum as the optimal substructure, and use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
Use a bottom-up approach with tabulation, initializing dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] for the first row and column respectively, then fill in dp[i][j] based on the minimum of dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1] plus grid[i][j].
The state for a cell i, j is the minimum sum of all numbers along the path from the top left corner to this cell.
This plan is correct and covers most edge cases. It can be improved by handling the base case more explicitly:
dp[0][j] = grid[0][j]; // initialize first row
dp[i][0] = grid[i][0]; // initialize first column
The only potential issue with the plan is that it does not handle the case when m or n is 1, which should return the sum of all numbers in the grid. However, this can be handled by adding an if condition to check if m or n is 1 before entering the tabulation loop.
