===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j];
Correctness: The plan is correct in identifying the minimum path sum as the optimal substructure and using memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Improvement: The plan can be improved by handling edge cases correctly. 

Potential Issues:
- What happens if i or j is 0? 
- How do you handle the first cell, which has no cell above it?

Edge Cases:
- Top row: dp[0][j] = grid[0][j], as there's no cell above it.
- Left column: dp[i][0] = grid[i][0], as there's no cell to its left.
