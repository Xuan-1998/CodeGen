The optimal substructure can be defined as the minimum sum of a single cell being either from above (top-down) or from left (bottom-up).
dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of all numbers along a path ending at cell [i][j]. The base case is when i or j is 0, meaning we've reached the top or left boundary, and the state expression is dp[i-1][j] + grid[i][j] for moving down, and dp[i][j-1] + grid[i][j] for moving right.
If there's a path ending at [i][j], then it must have come from one of the two cells above or to the left. 
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
Store memoized values using a dictionary with cell coordinates as keys.
Use a 2D array to initialize all cells initially and update them based on the dynamic programming equation.
The final answer is stored at dp[m-1][n-1].
