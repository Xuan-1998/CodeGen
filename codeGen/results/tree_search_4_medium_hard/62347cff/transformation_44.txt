===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the overlapping subproblems by recognizing that the minimum path sum for each cell depends on its neighbors. 
Use tabulation to store and reuse these calculations.

The state expression is:
    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j].

Initialize dp table with base cases:
    dp[0][j] = dp[0][j] = grid[0][j]
    for i in range(1, m):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0]

The most efficient approach would be to use dynamic programming with memoization, storing the intermediate results in a dictionary where the key is the cell's coordinates.
