===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the overlapping subproblems by recognizing that the minimum path sum for each cell depends on its neighbors. Use tabulation to store and reuse these calculations.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j].
For each cell, calculate the minimum path sum by considering its neighbors: top and left for non-boundary cells, only one neighbor for boundary cells.

Use a 2D array to store the minimum path sums, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum path sum up to cell (i, j).

Initialize the first row and column of the DP table as the values in the corresponding rows and columns of the grid, since these are the base cases.

Fill in the rest of the DP table row by row or column by column, using the state expression to calculate the value for each cell.

The final answer is stored in dp[m-1][n-1], which represents the minimum path sum from top left to bottom right.
