===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure can be defined as the minimum sum of a single cell being either from above (top-down) or from left (bottom-up).
dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of all numbers along a path ending at cell [i][j]. The base case is when i or j is equal to 0, meaning we've reached the top or left boundary. For each cell, there are two possibilities: either come from above (dp[i-1][j]) or from left (dp[i][j-1]).
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table and fill it in from top to bottom and left to right, updating each cell based on its predecessors.
