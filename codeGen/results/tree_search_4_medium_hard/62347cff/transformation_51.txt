===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the overlapping subproblems by recognizing that the minimum path sum for each cell depends on its neighbors.
Use tabulation to store and reuse these calculations.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(sum of all values above and to the left of (i, j)) + grid[i][j].

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

Use a 2D array to store intermediate results. Initialize the first row and column as 0.

Update dp[i][j] based on its neighbors (above or left).

When i=0, j=0 is the top-left corner, initialize it with the value of the top-left cell in the grid.

As you traverse down the rows or right through columns, update the current cell's dp value based on the minimum path sum from the top and left cells.

The final answer will be dp[m-1][n-1], where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.
