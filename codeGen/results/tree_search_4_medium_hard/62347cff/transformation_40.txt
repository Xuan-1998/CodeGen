===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure can be defined as the minimum sum of a single cell being either from above (top-down) or from left (bottom-up).

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum sum of all numbers along a path ending at cell [i][j]. The base case is when i is 0 or j is 0, which means we've reached the top or left boundary.

For each cell, there are two possibilities: either come from above (dp[i-1][j]) or from left (dp[i][j-1]), and the state expression is the minimum of these two values plus the value at the current cell.

The state can be formulated as dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]; to ensure that we choose the optimal path.

Use a 2D array (not dictionary) to store the memoized values, where each cell's value is the minimum sum of numbers along that path. Initialize all cells in the array with infinity, and update them as we fill the dp array.

The final answer will be stored at dp[m-1][n-1], which represents the minimum sum of all numbers along the path from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the grid.
