===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify the minimum path sum as the optimal substructure, and use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum path sum up to cell (i, j). The base case is when i or j reaches 0. In this case, dp[0][j] = grid[0][j] for all j, because we can only move right from the top row. Similarly, dp[i][0] = grid[i][0] for all i.

Consider a bottom-up approach where:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]

This recurrence relation holds because we have two options to move from cell (i, j): either down from cell (i-1, j) or right from cell (i, j-1). The minimum path sum up to cell (i, j) is the sum of the minimum path sum up to one of these cells and the value at cell (i, j).

Employing both tabulation and memoization techniques, where a 2D table dp is used to store intermediate results and updated accordingly.

Initialize the dp table with zeros. Then, fill in the dp table row by row, starting from the top-left corner.

Finally, return the value at the bottom-right corner of the dp table, which represents the minimum path sum up to that cell.
