===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure can be defined as the minimum sum of a single cell being either from above (top-down) or from left (bottom-up).
dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of all numbers along a path ending at cell [i][j]. The base case is when i or j is equal to 0, meaning we've reached the top or left boundary.
For each cell, there are two possibilities: either come from above (dp[i-1][j]) or from left (dp[i][j-1]).
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table with initial values of infinity or some large number.
The base cases are dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 0 for all i and j, since we can't move up from the top boundary or left from the left boundary.
The plan correctly identifies the optimal substructure and the dynamic programming table. However, it's missing an important detail: what values should the initial base cases hold? Infinity won't work because we need to handle the case where the minimum sum is 0.
One way to improve the plan is to use a more precise value for the initial base cases, such as 0 or the maximum possible value in the grid. This will ensure that our dynamic programming table doesn't get stuck in an infinite loop.
The plan also assumes that the input grid is non-empty and has at least one row and column. We should add checks to handle these edge cases before starting the dynamic programming process.
