===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of all numbers along a path ending at cell [i][j]. The base case is when i or j is equal to 0, meaning we've reached the top or left boundary. For each cell, there are two possibilities: either come from above (dp[max(0, i-1)][j]) or from left (dp[i][max(0, j-1)]).
dp[i][j] = min(dp[max(0, i-1)][j], dp[i][max(0, j-1)]) + grid[i][j]
Tabulate the solution by initializing dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] with 0, then fill the rest of the dp array using nested loops.
