===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify the minimum path sum as the optimal substructure, and use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state expression as:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j].

The dynamic programming state dp[i][j] represents the minimum path sum up to cell (i, j), and the transition relationship is correct.

You can use a 2D array to store the minimum path sum up to each cell, and then update the array as you fill it in. This approach ensures that we only calculate the minimum path sum once for each cell, avoiding redundant calculations.

The plan correctly identifies the optimal substructure (minimum path sum) and uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
