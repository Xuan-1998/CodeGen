In this plan, we first initialize the base cases where i or j is 0. Then, we fill up the dp table using the recurrence relation. Finally, we return the value at the bottom right corner of the dp table, which represents the minimum path sum.

This plan includes edge cases by handling the base cases where i or j is 0.
