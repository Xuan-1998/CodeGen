===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i][j] be the minimum path sum up to cell (i, j). The base case is when i or j reaches 0.

dp[0][j] = dp[j][0] = grid[0][0] for all j and i

Consider a bottom-up approach where:
- If i > 0 and j > 0, then dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
- This is because the minimum path sum to cell (i, j) is the sum of the grid value at that cell plus the minimum of the sums to the cells above or to the left

Implementing a dynamic programming approach by creating a 2D table and updating the values based on the optimal substructure.

The plan includes edge cases:
- The base case handles when i or j reaches 0
- The recursive formula handles all other cases
