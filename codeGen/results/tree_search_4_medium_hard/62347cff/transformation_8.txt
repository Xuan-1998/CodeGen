===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify the minimum path sum as the optimal substructure, and use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Create a 2D array dp with size m x n initialized to infinity for all cells except the top-left cell which is set to grid[0][0].

For each cell (i, j), calculate its state as the minimum of the states of the cell above it (dp[i-1][j]) and the cell to its left (dp[i][j-1]), plus the value of the current cell grid[i][j]. 

Store the result in dp[i][j] and update it if necessary.

Fill up the first row by setting each cell's state as the value of the corresponding cell in the grid, since we can only move right from the top-left corner to the cells in this row.

Fill up the first column by setting each cell's state as the value of the corresponding cell in the grid, since we can only move down from the top-left corner to the cells in this column.

The minimum path sum is stored in dp[m-1][n-1], which is the state of the bottom-right cell.
