===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the overlapping subproblems by recognizing that the minimum path sum for each cell depends on its neighbors. Use tabulation to store and reuse these calculations.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j].

To avoid unnecessary computations, we can optimize the state expression by only considering the minimum path sum from the top or left cell, depending on which direction is shorter. This can be done by initializing the first row and first column of the dp table with the corresponding values from the grid.

Apply memoization by storing the calculated values in a dictionary and checking for previously computed results before calculating them again.

Finally, the minimum path sum from the top left corner to the bottom right corner is stored in dp[m-1][n-1], which can be returned as the result.
