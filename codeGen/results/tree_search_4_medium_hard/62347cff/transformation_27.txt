===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure can be defined as the minimum sum of a single cell being either from above (top-down) or from left (bottom-up).
dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of all numbers along a path ending at cell [i][j]. The base case is when i or j is equal to 0, meaning we've reached the top or left boundary. For each cell, there are two possibilities: either come from above (dp[i-1][j]) or from left (dp[i][j-1]).
Create a separate function for calculating dp[i][j] and use it recursively, storing intermediate results in a cache.
Fill up the dp array by starting from the top-left cell [0][0], using the base case to fill cells along the top and left boundaries. Then, fill the rest of the cells row-by-row from top to bottom, left to right.
To avoid redundant calculations, use memoization (caching) to store intermediate results in a separate 2D array dpCache. This will significantly speed up the computation for larger grids.
