===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the overlapping subproblems by recognizing that the minimum path sum for each cell depends on its neighbors. 
Use tabulation to store and reuse these calculations.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j].
This is because the minimum path sum from a given cell can only be obtained by moving either down or right from one of its neighboring cells.

Use a 2D array to store the minimum path sum for each cell, updating it as you iterate through the grid.
The base cases are dp[0][j] = 0 and dp[i][0] = 0, since there's no way to move left or up from the top-left corner of the grid.

For each cell in the grid, calculate its minimum path sum by considering its neighboring cells' values.

Return the value at dp[m-1][n-1], which represents the minimum path sum from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid.
