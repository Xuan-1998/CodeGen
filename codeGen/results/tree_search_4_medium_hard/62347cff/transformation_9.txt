===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i][j] be the minimum path sum up to cell (i, j). The base case is when i or j reaches 0.
The optimal substructure is dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
Use dynamic programming with a 2D array to store the minimum path sum at each cell, updating it based on the values above and left.
Initialize the first row and column of the dp array as the corresponding rows and columns in the grid
For each cell (i, j) in the grid:
    If i or j is 0, return the value in the grid at that position
    Else, update dp[i][j] to be the minimum of the values above and left plus the value at the current cell
Return dp[m-1][n-1]
===END PLAN===
