===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the overlapping subproblems by recognizing that the minimum path sum for each cell depends on its neighbors. Use tabulation to store and reuse these calculations.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j].

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] if i > 0 else dp[0][j] if j > 0 else grid[0][0]
Store and reuse the calculations by filling up the dp array from top to bottom and left to right.

Fill in edge cases: 
- The base case is when i or j equals 0, then return the value at (0,0).
- Initialize all values in dp array as infinity except for the first element which is set to grid[0][0].

Verify that the plan does not include any redundant calculations.
