===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure can be defined as the minimum sum of a single cell being either from above (top-down) or from left (bottom-up).
dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of all numbers along a path ending at cell [i][j]. The base case is when i or j is equal to 0, meaning we've reached the top or left boundary.
For each cell, there are two possibilities: either come from above (dp[i-1][j]) or from left (dp[i][j-1]).
Use a dictionary (memoization) to store previously computed values and avoid redundant calculations, filling in the table in a bottom-up manner.

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + grid[i][j] if i > 0
           else dp[i][j-1] + grid[i][j] if j > 0

Fill the top row and left column first, as they only have one path option.
Then fill in the rest of the table bottom-up, using memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
