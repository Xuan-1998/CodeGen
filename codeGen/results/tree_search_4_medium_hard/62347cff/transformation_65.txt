===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the overlapping subproblems by recognizing that the minimum path sum for each cell depends on its neighbors. Use tabulation to store and reuse these calculations.

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum sum of all numbers along a path from the top left corner to cell (i, j). Then the base case is when i or j equals 0, in which case the minimum sum is simply the value at cell (i, j).

dp[i][j] is determined by considering the cell above it (dp[i-1][j]) and the cell to its left (dp[i][j-1]), and choosing the one with the smaller sum plus the current cell's value.

Create a 2D array dp of size m*n, where each element at index (i*m+j) represents the minimum path sum to reach cell (i, j). Initialize all elements to infinity except for the top left corner, which is set to 0.

Then iterate over the grid from top to bottom and left to right, updating each element's value based on its neighbors.

For each cell (i, j), calculate dp[i][j] as min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j].

Finally, return dp[m-1][n-1], which represents the minimum sum of all numbers along the path from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.
