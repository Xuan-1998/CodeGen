===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify the minimum path sum as the optimal substructure, and use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j];

The path sum from the top left to any cell i, j is the minimum of the path sums from the cell above it (i-1, j) or the cell to its left (i, j-1), plus the value of the current cell grid[i][j].

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach. Start from the base case and fill up the dp table in a top-down manner.

Base case: The minimum path sum for the first row and column is just the values in those cells.

Dynamic Programming Algorithm:

1. Initialize a 2D array dp of size m x n with all elements set to 0.
2. Iterate over each cell (i, j) in the grid:
   a. If it's the first row or column, set dp[i][j] to grid[i][j].
   b. Otherwise, set dp[i][j] to the minimum of dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1], plus grid[i][j].
3. Return dp[m-1][n-1] as the minimum path sum.
