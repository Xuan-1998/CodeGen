===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the overlapping subproblems by recognizing that the minimum path sum for each cell depends on its neighbors. 
Use tabulation to store and reuse these calculations.

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum sum of all numbers along a path from the top left corner to cell (i, j). Then the base case is when i or j equals 0, in which case the minimum sum is simply the value at cell (i, j).

dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of all numbers along a path from the top left corner to cell (i, j), considering only the cells directly above it (dp[i-1][j]) and to its left (dp[i][j-1]).

Use a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of all numbers along a path from the top left corner to cell (i, j). Initialize dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] with the values in the first row and first column respectively. 

Then fill up the rest of the dp table by considering only the cells directly above it (dp[i-1][j]) and to its left (dp[i][j-1]). 

Finally, return dp[m-1][n-1], where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.
