===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the overlapping subproblems by recognizing that the minimum path sum for each cell depends on its neighbors. Use tabulation to store and reuse these calculations.

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum sum of all numbers along a path from the top left corner to cell (i, j). Then the base case is when i or j equals 0, in which case the minimum sum is simply the value at cell (i, j).

dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of all numbers along a path from the top left corner to cell (i, j), considering only the cells directly above it (dp[i-1][j]) and to its left (dp[i][j-1]).

Use a list of lists dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum sum of all numbers along a path from the top left corner to cell (i, j). Initialize the first row with the values in the first row. Then fill up the rest of the dp table by considering only the cells directly above it (dp[i-1][j]) and to its left (dp[i][j-1]). Finally, return dp[m-1][n-1] as the minimum sum of all numbers along a path from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.
