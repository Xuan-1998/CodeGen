===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure can be defined as the minimum sum of a single cell being either from above (top-down) or from left (bottom-up).
dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum of all numbers along a path ending at cell [i][j]. The base case is when i or j is 0, meaning we've reached the top or left boundary, and the state expression is dp[i-1][j] + grid[i][j] for moving down, and dp[i][j-1] + grid[i][j] for moving right.
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j] + grid[i][j], dp[i][j-1] + grid[i][j])
Memoize the recursive function calls by storing the computed DP states in a cache and reusing them when needed.

The initial values should be set as dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since we start from the top boundary.
And similarly dp[i][0] = 0 for all i, since we start from the left boundary.

To ensure that the base cases are handled correctly, we should add a condition to check if i or j is less than the grid dimensions. If true, return the value of the corresponding base case.

The plan looks correct, but it's missing some edge cases like handling when i or j reaches the grid boundaries.
