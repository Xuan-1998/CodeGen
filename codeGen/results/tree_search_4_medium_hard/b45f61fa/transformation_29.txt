===BEGIN PLAN===
Bottom-up approach with tabulation: Define a table 'dp[i][j]' where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply matrices from 0 to i, inclusive.

Let 'dp[i][j]' be the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply all matrices from i to j. Compute it as the minimum of the sum of the product of the dimensions of the current matrix with the minimum number of multiplications for the sub-sequence (i+1 to k-1) plus 1, where k varies from i+1 to j.

Memoize 'dp[i][j]' by defining a function that takes in an array index and returns the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply all matrices from i to j. Use this function to compute each cell in the table.
