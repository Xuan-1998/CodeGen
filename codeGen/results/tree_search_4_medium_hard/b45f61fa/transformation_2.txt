Top-down approach with memoization:
Identify subproblems as 'multiply matrices from i to j' and memoize solutions for overlapping subproblems.

Define the state expression as a tuple (i, j) representing the range of matrices to multiply, 
and the base case is when i == 0 or j == n-1 (single matrix remaining).

Define a dynamic programming table dp[][] with dimensions O(n^2), where 
dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply matrices from i to j.

Implement a recursive function that takes two indices i and j as input, computes 
the minimum number of multiplications recursively using smaller subproblems, 
and memoizes the results in a table.

The plan is correct. To improve it, consider initializing dp[i][j] = 0 for all (i, j) to simplify the base case check.
Potential issues with the plan:
- Make sure to handle edge cases correctly, such as when i == 0 or j == n-1.
- Implement proper memoization to store and reuse previously computed results.
