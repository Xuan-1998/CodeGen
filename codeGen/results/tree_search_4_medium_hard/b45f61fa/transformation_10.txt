===BEGIN PLAN===
Top-down approach with memoization:
Identify subproblems as 'multiply matrices from i to j' and memoize solutions for overlapping subproblems.

Define the state expression as a 2D array dp[i][j] storing the minimum number of multiplications for matrices from i to j, and the base case is when i == 0 (no matrices left) or j == n-1 (no more matrices to multiply).

Define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of multiplications for matrices from i to j, considering all possible ways to split the chain into two subchains.

Use a dictionary to store the memoized values and look up solutions for overlapping subproblems.

Construct the optimal parenthesization by backtracking from the bottom-up DP table. Start from dp[0][n-1] (the minimum number of multiplications for the entire matrix chain) and recursively find the indices where the chain was split.

Store the resulting optimal parenthesization in a string, using uppercase alphabets to denote each matrix.
