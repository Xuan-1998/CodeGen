===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine optimal substructure by observing that the problem can be broken down into smaller instances: for each pair of adjacent matrices (i to j), find the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply all matrices up to j-1, then add the cost of multiplying i-th matrix with the result.

The state expression could be min[i][j] = minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply matrices from i to j, and min[0][i] is the base case. The state could be dp[i][j] = minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply matrices from i to j, with a transition relation dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k-1] + p[i-1]*p[k]*p[j], k from i+1 to j) for the base case set dp[0][i] = 0.

Implement memoization using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computations. The dynamic programming table could be initialized with zeros or negative infinity, whichever is more suitable.

The solution would iterate over all possible pairs of matrices (i to j), calculate the minimum number of multiplications needed for each pair, and store it in the dp[i][j] state. Then, find the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply all matrices by iterating through the dp[0][n-1] row and returning the smallest value.

The final result would be the optimal parenthesization order, which can be constructed from the dynamic programming table by tracing back the parenthesization order for each pair of matrices.
