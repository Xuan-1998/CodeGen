===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine optimal substructure by observing that the problem can be broken down into smaller instances: for each pair of adjacent matrices (i to j), find the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply all matrices up to j-1, then add the cost of multiplying i-th matrix with the result.

The state expression could be min[i][j] = minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply matrices from i to j, and min[0][i] is the base case.

The state could be dp[i][j] = minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply matrices from i to j, with a transition relation:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k-1] + p[i-1]*p[k]*p[j], k from i+1 to j) 
for the base case set dp[0][i] = 0.

Create a table min where min[i][j] is initialized as infinity and then updated based on the state expression, with the goal of finding the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply all matrices.

The plan looks correct overall, but there are some minor issues:

* The initialization of the dp table should be done correctly. Since we're using dynamic programming, we need to initialize the dp table correctly for the base case.
* The transition relation could be improved by adding a check for i == j to avoid unnecessary computations.

Here's the updated plan:
