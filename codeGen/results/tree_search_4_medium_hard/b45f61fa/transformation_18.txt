===BEGIN PLAN===
Top-down approach with memoization: Identify subproblems as 'multiply matrices from i to j' and memoize solutions for overlapping subproblems.

Define the state expression as a tuple (i, j) representing the pair of matrices to be multiplied from index i to j. The base case is when i == 0 (first matrix) or j == n-1 (last matrix).

State: (i, j), Transition: if j - i == 1, then there's only one matrix to multiply; else, consider multiplying the first i matrices with k-1 matrices on their right, and then add the cost of multiplying the last j-i matrices.

Use a dictionary to store the dynamic programming table where keys are tuples (i, j) and values are the minimum number of multiplications. Initialize the base cases when i == 0 or j == n-1.

Fill in the dynamic programming table by iterating from i = 0 to n-2, and for each i, calculate the minimum cost for multiplying matrices from i to j by considering all possible ways to multiply the first i+1 matrices with k-1 matrices on their right, and then add the cost of multiplying the last j-i matrices. Use memoized values to avoid redundant calculations.

The final answer is the value stored in the dynamic programming table when (i, j) equals (0, n-1).
