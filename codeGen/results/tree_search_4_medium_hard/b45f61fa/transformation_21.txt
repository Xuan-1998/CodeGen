===BEGIN PLAN===
Top-down approach with memoization:
    Identify subproblems as 'multiply matrices from i to j' and memoize solutions for overlapping subproblems.

Define the state expression as a tuple (i, j, k) representing the current matrix being multiplied with k matrices on its right, and the base case is when i == 0 (first matrix) or k == 0 (no more matrices to multiply).

    State: dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply all matrices from index i to j.

    Transition:
        if j - i == 1, then there's only one matrix to multiply;
        else, consider two options: either include the current matrix in the multiplication chain or not.
        The minimum cost can be calculated using the memoized values and previously computed dp[i][j-1] values.

Use dynamic programming with a table dp[][] to store the solutions to subproblems:

    Initialize the base case when i == 0 or k == 0: dp[0][i] = 0, dp[i][0] = 0

    For each possible split (i, j) of the matrix chain:
        Calculate the minimum cost for the left and right parts using memoized values
        Consider including the current matrix in the multiplication chain or not
        Choose the option with the minimum cost

    Return the solution for the entire matrix chain: dp[0][n-1]
