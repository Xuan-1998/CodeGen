===BEGIN PLAN===
Top-down approach with memoization:
    Identify subproblems as 'multiply matrices from i to j' and memoize solutions for overlapping subproblems.
Define the state expression as a 2D array dp[i][j] storing the minimum number of multiplications for matrices from i to j, and the base case is when i == 0 (no matrices left) or j == n-1 (no more matrices to multiply).
    Define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of multiplications for matrices from i to j, considering all possible ways to split the chain into two subchains.
Memoize the solutions using a 2D array dp[i][j] and update the state expression accordingly.
