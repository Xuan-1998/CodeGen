===BEGIN PLAN===
Top-down approach with memoization: Identify subproblems as 'multiply matrices from i to j' and memoize solutions for overlapping subproblems.

Define the state expression as a 2D array dp[i][j] storing the minimum number of multiplications for matrices from i to j, and the base case is when i == 0 (no matrices left) or j == n-1 (no more matrices to multiply).

Define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of multiplications for matrices from i to j, considering all possible ways to split the chain into two subchains.

 Define a function minMul(p, i, j) that takes the dimensions of the matrices and the indices i and j as input, and returns the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply the matrices from i to j.

For each cell dp[i][j], consider all possible splits: dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] for k from i to j-1. Calculate the minimum multiplication cost for each split and store it in dp[i][j].

Finally, return minMul(p, 0, n-1) as the overall minimum number of multiplications needed.
