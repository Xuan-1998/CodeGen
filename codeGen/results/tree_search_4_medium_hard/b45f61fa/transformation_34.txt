Determine optimal substructure by observing that the problem can be broken down into smaller instances: for each pair of adjacent matrices (i to j), find the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply all matrices up to j-1, then add the cost of multiplying i-th matrix with the result. The state expression could be dp[i][j] = minimum number of multiplications to multiply matrices from i to j, with dp[0][k] being the base case (matrix 1 times matrix k for all k).
dp[i][j] = minimum number of multiplications to multiply matrices from i to j, considering the possibility of multiplying i-th matrix with the result of dp[i-1][k] for all k < i.
Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply matrices from i to j.
For each pair of adjacent matrices (i to j), calculate the cost of multiplying the i-th matrix with the result of dp[i-1][k] for all k < i, and take the minimum cost among these options. This would be equivalent to finding the optimal parenthesization of the matrix chain.
The base case could be initializing the first row and column of the 2D array to represent the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply a single matrix, which is simply the dimension of that matrix squared.
