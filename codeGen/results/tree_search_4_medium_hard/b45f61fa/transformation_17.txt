Top-down approach with memoization:
    * Identify subproblems as 'multiply matrices from i to j' and memoize solutions for overlapping subproblems.
Define the state expression as a tuple (i, j, k) representing the current matrix being multiplied with k matrices on its right, and the base case is when i == 0 (first matrix) or k == 0 (no more matrices to multiply).
    * State: (i, j, k), where
        + i is the starting index of the current subproblem,
        + j is the ending index of the current subproblem, and
        + k is the number of matrices to multiply on the right side.
Transition:
    * if k == 0, then the result is the product of the current matrix with all the matrices on its left;
    * else, consider two options: either include the current matrix in the multiplication chain or not.
The minimum cost of multiplying the first i matrices and k-1 matrices on their right can be calculated using the memoized values.
Utilize a dictionary-based memoization approach by storing the minimum cost of multiplying matrices from i to j in a dictionary and look up the precomputed values when needed.
    * Initialize a dictionary, dp, with default values as infinity.
    * For each subproblem (i, j, k), calculate the result using the transition function and store it in dp[(i, j, k)].
    * When calculating the result for a subproblem, look up precomputed values in dp whenever possible to avoid redundant calculations.
