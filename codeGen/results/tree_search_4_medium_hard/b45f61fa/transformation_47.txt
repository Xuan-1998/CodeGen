===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine optimal substructure by observing that the problem can be broken down into smaller instances: for each pair of adjacent matrices (i to j), find the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply all matrices up to j-1, then add the cost of multiplying i-th matrix with the result.
The state expression could be dp[i][j] = minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply matrices from i to j, and dp[0][i] is the base case. 
The transition relation can be formulated as follows: 

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k-1] + p[i-1]*p[k]*p[j], k from i+1 to j)

Base case: dp[0][i] = 0
Fill the table in a bottom-up manner, starting with i=2 and going up to n. For each pair of adjacent matrices (i to j), calculate the minimum number of multiplications needed by considering all possible divisions between them.
Return the value at dp[1][n-1] as the result.
