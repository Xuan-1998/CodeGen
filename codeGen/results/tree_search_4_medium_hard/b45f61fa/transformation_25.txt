===BEGIN PLAN===
Bottom-up approach with tabulation: Define a table 'dp[i][j]' where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply matrices from 0 to i, inclusive, and store the results in the table.

For each cell dp[i][j], consider all possible split points k between i and j (inclusive). Calculate the minimum number of multiplications for the sub-sequence from i to k and the sub-sequence from k+1 to j. The total cost is the sum of these two costs plus the cost of multiplying matrices at position k.

Compute dp[0][n-1] as the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply all n matrices, which is the final result.

Create a table dp[][] with size n x n, where dp[i][j] stores the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply matrices from i to j.

Use this information to construct the optimal parenthesization of the matrix chain by tracing back the minimum number of multiplications found in the table.
