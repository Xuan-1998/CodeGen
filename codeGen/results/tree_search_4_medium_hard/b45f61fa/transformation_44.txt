Determine optimal substructure by observing that the problem can be broken down into smaller instances: for each pair of adjacent matrices (i to j), find the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply all matrices up to j-1, then add the cost of multiplying i-th matrix with the result.
The state expression could be min[i][j] = minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply matrices from i to j, and min[0][i] is the base case.

The state transition relation dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k-1] + p[i-1]*p[k]*p[j], k from i+1 to j) captures the optimal way to multiply matrices. The transition function takes into account the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply matrices up to j, and adds the cost of multiplying the i-th matrix with the result.

Tabulate the solution by iterating over all possible pairs of adjacent matrices and storing the minimum number of multiplications in a 2D table.
