Top-down approach with memoization:

1.. Define the state expression as a tuple (i, j) representing the range of matrices to multiply.

2. Identify the base case: when i == 0 or j == n-1 (single matrix remaining), and define its value (the number of multiplications for this single matrix).

3. Formulate state and transition relationships by considering all possible ways to divide the matrix chain into two parts: from i to k and from k+1 to j, and choose the combination that minimizes the total number of multiplications.

    - Calculate the minimum number of multiplications for each way (i.e., min(multiply_matrices(i, k) + multiply_matrices(k+1, j))).
    - Update memoization dictionary with the calculated value.
    
4. Determine the optimal way to divide the matrix chain into two parts by considering all possible ways and selecting the combination that minimizes the total number of multiplications.

5. Store the solution in a 2D DP table (n x n), where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of multiplications for matrices i to j, and update memoization dictionary accordingly.
