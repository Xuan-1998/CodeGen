===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization vs Tabulation: We could use memoization by defining a recursive function that stores the results of subproblems in a dictionary, or we could use tabulation by creating a 1D array where each cell dp[i] represents the maximum joy for i hares.
The state could be dp[i] representing the maximum joy for i hares, with the base case being when i == 1, where dp[1] is either b[0] or c[0] depending on whether the hare was fed first or last.
State: dp[i]: maximum joy for i hares, where dp[1] is either b[0] or c[0]; Transition:
    if i == 1:
        return max(b[0], c[0])
    elif i % 2 == 0:  # both adjacent hares are full
        return a[i//2 - 1] + dp[(i-2)//2]
    else:  # exactly one adjacent hare is full
        return b[(i-1)//2] + dp[(i-3)//2]
Maintain a dictionary memo where each key is a tuple representing the state (i) and its corresponding value is the maximum joy for that state.
The plan seems to be correct, and it covers most edge cases. However, we should ensure that we handle the case where i < 1 correctly.
