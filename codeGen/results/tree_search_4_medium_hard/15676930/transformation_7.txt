===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: The dynamic programming solution can be viewed as a 2D array, where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max joy obtained by feeding first i hares, with j hares full. 

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + c_i if j > 0, dp[i-1][j] + a_i if j == 0, dp[i-2][j-1] + b_i - i if i > 1)

Tabulate the dynamic programming solution by initializing a 2D array dp with dimensions n x (n+1), where dp[i][j] represents the maximum joy obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

For edge cases, consider setting base cases for dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there are no hares to feed initially. 

The plan considers the correct overlapping subproblems and state expression but can be improved in terms of readability by breaking it down into smaller steps.
