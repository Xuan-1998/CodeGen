===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: The dynamic programming solution can be viewed as a 2D array, where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = maximum total joy obtained by feeding the first i hares, considering whether hare i has adjacent full hares or not.

dp[i][j] = min(max(dp[i-1][0] + c_i) for a_i in range(10^5)) and (max(dp[i-1][1] + b_i) for a_i in range(10^5)))

Consider using a 2D array to store the dynamic programming values and iterate over the rows, columns, and previous states.

To improve the plan, consider initializing the base cases of dp[0][j] and dp[i][0], as they would not depend on any previous state. This can help in reducing the complexity of the problem.

Edge cases: Ensure that the initial values of the 2D array are set to a default value (e.g., -inf) or initialized with base case values before starting the iteration process.
