===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure: We can break down the problem of finding the maximum joy into smaller subproblems of feeding one hare or not, and then combining these solutions to find the overall maximum. This is an example of optimal substructure because the solution to the larger problem depends on the solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

The base case would be when there's only one hare or no hares, in which case we don't have any choices to make.

Consider states as (index of hare being fed, whether previous hare is full, whether next hare is full). State transitions can be defined based on the three different cases: feeding a hungry hare, feeding a partially full hare, and not feeding a full hare. The value function could calculate the total joy given these state variables.

To improve this plan, we should also consider that hares are fed in order (i.e., left to right), so we don't need to keep track of the previous or next hare's fullness for every single hare. Instead, we can maintain a variable tracking whether the previous hare is full and another variable tracking whether the current hare is hungry.

Additionally, we should handle edge cases such as when there are only two hares (in which case we don't need to consider the next hare's fullness) or when all hares are full (in which case feeding any more hares would not increase joy).

Memoization using dictionary to store function calls and results can be used to avoid redundant calculations.
