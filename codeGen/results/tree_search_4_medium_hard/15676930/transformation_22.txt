===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: The dynamic programming solution can be viewed as a 2D array, where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][0] + c_i, dp[i-1][1] + b_i) if j > 0 else a_i

dp[i][0] = sum of joys for each possible ordering of the last two hares
dp[0][j] = 0 for j=0 to n

Implement memoization using a recursive function with an optional cache parameter to store intermediate results.

The base case is when i == 0, where dp[i][j] = 0 for all j. This handles the edge cases of feeding no hares.

To improve this plan, we can use dynamic programming and memoization to avoid redundant calculations by storing intermediate results in a cache.

The potential issue with this plan is that it assumes the maximum total joy can be obtained by feeding the hares in a certain order. However, this may not always be the case, especially if there are multiple possible orders of feeding the hares that achieve the same maximum total joy.
