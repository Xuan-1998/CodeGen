===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] represents the maximum joy for i hares and j full hares.
The state transition is:
dp[i][j] = max(dp[k][j-1] + (a[i-k] if k == 0 or c[i-k]) else b[i-k], dp[k][j] for k in range(j))
Base case: dp[0][*] = 0 and dp[*][0] = c[0]
Fill the table from top to bottom, left to right.
Return dp[n-1][n-1] as the maximum total joy.
===END PLAN===
