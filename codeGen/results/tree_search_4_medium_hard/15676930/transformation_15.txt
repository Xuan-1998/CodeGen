===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: The dynamic programming solution can be viewed as a 2D array, where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = maximum total joy obtained by feeding the first i hares, considering whether hare i has adjacent full hares or not.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][0] + c_i if j == 0 else
                  dp[i-1][1] + b_i if j == 1 else
                  dp[i-2][0] + a_i)
Employing top-down memoization by recursively solving smaller subproblems and storing their results.

Handle edge cases: 
dp[0][j] = 0 for all j (since there are no hares to feed)
