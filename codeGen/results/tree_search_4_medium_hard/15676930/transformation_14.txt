Identifying overlapping subproblems: The dynamic programming solution can be viewed as a 2D array, where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = maximum total joy obtained by feeding the first i hares, considering whether hare i has adjacent full hares or not.
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][0], sum(a_k) for k in range(i+1)) if j == 0 
           else dp[i-1][j-1]

Using bottom-up dynamic programming with a 2D table to store the maximum joy for each subproblem. Start filling up the table from the base case where i = 0, and then fill it up row by row.

For edge cases, handle the initial conditions properly, ensuring that dp[0][j] is calculated correctly, where j ranges from 0 to n.
The plan seems correct; however, it would be beneficial to add a step for handling invalid inputs (i.e., when the input values are not within the given constraints).
The overall approach looks good, but it's essential to ensure that edge cases and potential issues are addressed and handled correctly.
