===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: The dynamic programming solution can be viewed as a 2D array, where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = sum of joys for each possible ordering of the last two hares.
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + a_i, dp[i-1][j] + b_i, dp[i-1][j+1] + c_i) + a_{i-1}

To use memoization and implement a recursive function with memoization dictionary.
dp[0][j] = 0 for all j
dp[i][0] = 0 for all i

The base case can be handled by initializing the first row or column to have a value of 0.

The plan looks correct, but it can be improved by using tabulation instead of recursion. This would reduce the time complexity and make the code more efficient.
The plan does not include edge cases explicitly, but it can be handled implicitly by checking for valid indices in the dynamic programming array.
