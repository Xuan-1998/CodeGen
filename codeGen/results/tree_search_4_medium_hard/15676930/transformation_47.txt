===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization vs Tabulation: We could use memoization by defining a recursive function that stores the results of subproblems in a dictionary, or we could use tabulation by creating a 2D array where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy for i hares and j full hares.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max(0 <= k < i ? dp[k-1][j-1] + (a[k-1] if j == 0 else b[k-1]) : 0), where the base case is dp[0][*] = c[0], and dp[*][0] = c[0], with dp[i][*] being monotonically increasing in i.

Think about using a 2D array dp where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum total joy when the first i hares are fed in some order, considering j of them as being full so far.

Define a recursive function that stores the results of subproblems in a dictionary using memoization.
