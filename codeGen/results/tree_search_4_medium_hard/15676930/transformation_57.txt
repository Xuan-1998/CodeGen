===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization vs Tabulation: We could use tabulation by creating a 2D array where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy for i hares and j full hares.

The state could be dp[i][j]: maximum joy for i hares, with k full hares; Transition: 
dp[i][k] = max(dp[i-1][k-1], dp[i-1][k] if k < n else c[i-1]) + a[i-1]

Define a loop that iterates over the hares and for each hare, use another loop to calculate the maximum joy considering all possible states.
Initialize dp[0][j] = 0; dp[i][0] = 0;

State: 
dp[i][k]: maximum joy for i hares, with k full hares;
Base case: dp[1][0] = a[0], dp[1][1] = b[0]; dp[1][n-1] = c[0]

Loop over the number of hares:
For each number of hares i:
  Loop over all possible states k from 0 to n-1:
    Calculate dp[i][k]: maximum joy for i hares, with k full hares;
    Update the maximum joy for this state
Return dp[n-1][n-2]
