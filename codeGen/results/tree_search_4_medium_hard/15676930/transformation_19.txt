===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: The dynamic programming solution can be viewed as a 2D array, where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = sum of joys for each possible ordering of the last two hares.
dp[i][j] = max(a_i + dp[i-1][j-1], b_i + dp[i-1][j], c_i + dp[i-1][j+1])

To improve the plan, we can consider initializing the base case as [0][0] to 0 and then fill up the table. This is because there are no hares initially, so the maximum joy would be 0.

Another optimization could be to only store values of dp[i][j] where j <= i/2 (or some similar condition) to reduce space complexity. However, this might not always hold true as we don't know which case has more overlapping subproblems without further analysis.

We can also consider sorting the hares based on their joy values before filling up the table. This is because feeding the hares with the highest joy first would give us a chance to get more joy overall.

The plan does not include edge cases explicitly, but it should handle them correctly as long as the base case is set up correctly and the state expression is correct.
