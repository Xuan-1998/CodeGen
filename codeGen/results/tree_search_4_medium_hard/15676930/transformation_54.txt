===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization vs Tabulation: We could use tabulation by creating a 2D array where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy for i hares and j full hares.

The state could be dp[i][j] representing the maximum joy for i hares and j full hares, with the base case being when i == 1 or j == 0, where dp[1][0] is either b[0] or c[0], and dp[1][1] is max(b[0], c[0]).

State: dp[i][j]: maximum joy for i hares and j full hares
Transition:
    - If j == 0, then dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][0], a[i-1] + (dp[i-2][0] if i > 1 else b[i-1]))
    - Else, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], c[i-1] + dp[i-1][j-1])

Use a 2D array tab of size n+1 by n+1 with tab[0][j] set to 0 for all j, and fill the table row by row from top to bottom using the transition function. The answer is stored in tab[n][n].
