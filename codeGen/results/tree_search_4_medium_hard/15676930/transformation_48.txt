===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization vs Tabulation: We could use memoization by defining a recursive function that stores the results of subproblems in a dictionary, but it would be more efficient to use tabulation by creating a 2D array where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy for i hares and j full hares.

The state expression is correct: dp[i][j] = max(0 <= k < i ? dp[k][j-1] + b[i-k] : c[i]), where the base case is dp[0][*] = 0 and dp[*][0] = d[0], with dp[i][*] being monotonically increasing in i.

The idea of using a 2D array dp where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum total joy when the first i hares are fed in some order, considering j of them as being full so far, is correct.

We can use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach, filling up the 2D table in a row-major order. The outer loop would iterate over the number of hares (i), and the inner loop would iterate over the number of full hares (j).

The plan includes edge cases: dp[0][*] = 0 and dp[*][0] = d[0].

Here is the updated plan:
