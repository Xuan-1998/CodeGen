===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: The dynamic programming solution can be viewed as a 2D array, where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max joy obtained by feeding first i hares, with j hares full.
dp[i][j] = max(sum(a_k for k in range(i)) - i + j, sum(b_k for k in range(j)) - j)

Tabulate the dynamic programming solution by initializing a 2D array dp with dimensions n+1 x (n+1), where dp[i][j] represents the maximum joy obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.
