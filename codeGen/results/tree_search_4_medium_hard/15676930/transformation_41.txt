===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization vs Tabulation: We could use memoization by defining a recursive function that stores the results of subproblems in a dictionary, or we could use tabulation by creating a 2D array where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy for i hares and j full hares.

The state could be a tuple (n, j) representing the number of remaining hares and full hares respectively, with the base case being when n == 0 or j == 0.
Define the state as dp[n][j] = max(dp[n-1][k-1] + b_n if k > 0 else dp[n-1][k+1] + c_n else a_n), where dp[n][j] represents the maximum joy for n hares and j full hares.

Memoization can be achieved by defining a recursive function that stores the results of subproblems in a dictionary.
To avoid redundant computation, we could also use tabulation to fill up the 2D array in a bottom-up manner.
