===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: The dynamic programming solution can be viewed as a 2D array, where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max joy obtained by feeding first i hares, with j hares full.
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + c_i, dp[i-1][0] + b_i)

Memoization can be applied using a dictionary to store and update the maximum joy values.

Identifying base cases: The base case could be when i or j is 0. In this case, dp[i][j] = 0.

Handling edge cases: Edge cases would include scenarios where n is small (1 or 2), as there would be less complexity in such cases.
