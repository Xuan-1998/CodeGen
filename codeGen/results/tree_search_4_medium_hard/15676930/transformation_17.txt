===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: The dynamic programming solution can be viewed as a 2D array, where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max of joys for each possible ordering of the last two hares.
dp[i][j] = max(a_i + dp[i-1][j-1], b_i + dp[i-1][j], c_i + dp[i-1][j+1])

Create a 2D array with size (n, n) and initialize all values to -1, representing the maximum possible total joy. Then fill in the dp table using the state expression.

Initialize dp[0][0] = 0 because there are no hares fed or full.
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][max(j-1, 0)] + c_i (if j > i) or a_i (otherwise)

The maximum possible total joy is stored in dp[n-1][n//2].
