===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: The dynamic programming solution can be viewed as a 2D array, where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = maximum total joy obtained by feeding the first i hares, considering whether hare i has adjacent full hares or not.
dp[i][j] = min(max(dp[i-1][0] + c_i) for a_i in range(10^5)) and (max(dp[i-1][1] + b_i) for a_i in range(10^5)))

Implement tabulation by filling in the 2D array row by row, starting from the base case where i = 0 and iterating until the maximum number of hares is reached.
For edge cases: Handle the case where i = 0 by setting dp[0][j] = 0 for all j.

The plan looks correct; however, it would be more efficient to implement the dynamic programming in a bottom-up manner. This would involve filling up the array row by row, starting from the base case where i = n and decreasing i until i = 0.
This approach would avoid unnecessary calculations and reduce the overall time complexity.
