===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: The dynamic programming solution can be viewed as a 2D array, where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = sum of joys for each possible ordering of the last two hares.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + a_i, dp[i-1][j] + b_i, dp[i-1][j+1] + c_i)

To implement dynamic programming using the tabulation method:

* Initialize a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all values initially set to -INF.
* Set dp[0][j] = 0 for all j. This represents the base case where there are no hares left to feed.
* Iterate over i from 1 to n and for each i, iterate over j from 0 to i:
	+ Calculate dp[i][j] as described in the state expression.
	+ Update dp[i][j] with the maximum value found.
* The maximum total joy that can be obtained is stored in dp[n][k], where k is the number of hares full.
