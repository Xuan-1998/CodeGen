The optimal substructure: We can break down the problem of finding the maximum joy into smaller subproblems of feeding one hare or not, and then combining these solutions to find the overall maximum. This is an example of optimal substructure because the solution to the larger problem depends on the solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

The base case would be when there's only one hare or no hares, in which case we don't have any choices to make.

Let's define states as (index of hare being fed, number of adjacent hares that are full). Transitions can be defined based on whether the current hare is adjacent to any full hares or not. The value function could then consider the different cases depending on how many adjacent hares are full and which ones need feeding.

To avoid redundant calculations and speed up computation, we can use a dictionary-based memoization approach to store and retrieve the values for different states.

We'll also need to consider edge cases like when there's only one hare or no hares. In these cases, the maximum joy is simply the total value of all hares.
