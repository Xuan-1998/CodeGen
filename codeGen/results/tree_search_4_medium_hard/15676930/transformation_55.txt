===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization vs Tabulation: We could use memoization by defining a recursive function that stores the results of subproblems in a dictionary, but it's more suitable for tabulation with dynamic programming here. 
The state could be dp[i][j]: maximum joy for i hares and j full hares; Transition: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] + (a[i-1] if k == 0 else b[i-1]) for k in range(j)) if j > 0 else dp[i-1][0] + a[i-1]
Create a 2D array to store the maximum joy values and iterate through it using nested loops. 
Base case: dp[1][j] = c[0] for all j
dp[n][j]: sum of joys from all hares with j full adjacent ones
Initialize dp with base cases, then fill in the rest using transitions.
The final answer is dp[n][k], where k is the maximum number of full adjacent ones.
