===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: The dynamic programming solution can be viewed as a 2D array, where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max of joys for each possible ordering of the last two hares.

dp[i][0] = c_i
dp[0][j] = 0

for i from 1 to n:
    for j from 0 to min(i, j+1):
        if j == 0: 
            dp[i][j] = max(a_i + dp[i-1][j], b_i + dp[i-1][j])
        elif j == i:
            dp[i][j] = c_i
        else:
            dp[i][j] = max(a_i + dp[i-1][j-1], b_i + dp[i-1][j], c_i + dp[i-1][j+1])

Return the maximum value in the bottom-right corner, i.e., dp[n][0]
