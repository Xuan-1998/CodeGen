===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: The dynamic programming solution can be viewed as a 2D array, where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum total joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = maximum total joy obtained by feeding the first i hares, considering whether hare i has adjacent full hares or not.
dp[i][j] = min(max(dp[i-1][0] + c_i) for a_i in range(10^5)) and (max(dp[i-1][1] + b_i) for a_i in range(10^5)))

However, the plan seems to be missing an important step - handling the base case. The first row of hares will always have a total joy value equal to the sum of their individual joy values.

To handle edge cases, it's essential to consider what happens when i = 1 or j = 0. In these cases, there are no adjacent hares, so we should only consider one type of joy (either c_i or b_i).

Here's an updated version of the plan:
