===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: The dynamic programming solution can be viewed as a 2D array, where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max joy obtained by feeding first i hares, with j hares full.
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-2][1] + a_i if i == 1 else dp[i-1][j-1] + (a_i if j == 1 else c_i)),
The base case is when there's only one hare, the maximum joy would be a_1.
The recursive case is to consider two scenarios: either we feed the current hare or not. If we don't feed it, the maximum joy would be dp[i-1][0]. If we do feed it, the maximum joy would be dp[i-2][1] + a_i if i == 1 else dp[i-1][j-1] + (a_i if j == 1 else c_i).

Memoization: Store the values of dp[i][j] in an array to avoid recomputation.
