===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: The dynamic programming solution can be viewed as a 2D array, where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = maximum total joy obtained by feeding the first i hares, considering whether hare i has adjacent full hares or not.

dp[i][j] = max(a_i + dp[i-1][k-1] + dp[i-1][k]) for k in range(min(j, i)),

Employ top-down dynamic programming with a recursive function that utilizes memoization to optimize computations. This approach can help reduce the time complexity by avoiding redundant calculations.

To improve the plan, we can consider adding more base cases or edge cases, such as handling the case where j = 0 (i.e., all hares are full).

The potential issue with this plan is that it might not correctly handle the case where j > i (i.e., there are more full hares than hungry ones). We should add additional checks to ensure the correctness of the solution.

Finally, we can also consider adding a base case for dp[0][j] = 0, as there is no joy obtained when feeding no hares.
