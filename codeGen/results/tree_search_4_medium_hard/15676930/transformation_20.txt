===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: The dynamic programming solution can be viewed as a 2D array, where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max(joy for last two hares) + dp[i-1][0] (when the last hare is fed) or dp[i-1][j] (when the last hare is not fed).

dp[i][0] = c_i for i=0 to n, and dp[0][j] = 0 for j=0 to n

Use a 2D table where dp[i][j] represents the maximum joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.
