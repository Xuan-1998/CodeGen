===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: The dynamic programming solution can be viewed as a 2D array, where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = maximum total joy obtained by feeding the first i hares, considering whether hare i has adjacent full hares or not.
dp[i][j] = max(sum(a_k) for k in range(i+1)) if j == 0 or dp[i-1][j-1]

Applying dynamic programming with both memoization and tabulation: 
- Initialize a 2D array dp of size n x (n+1), where dp[i][j] will store the maximum total joy for feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.
- For each hare i from 0 to n-1, compute dp[i][0] = sum(a_k) for k in range(i+1)
- Then, for each possible number of full hares j from 1 to min(i+1, n), 
    - Compute the maximum total joy by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full: 
        dp[i][j] = max(sum(b_k) for k in range(j)) if j == 1 or (j > 1 and sum(c_k) for k in range(j-1))
    - Use this value to update the maximum total joy by feeding the first i+1 hares and having k hares full, where k = min(j+1, n): 
        dp[i+1][k] = max(dp[i+1][k], dp[i][j])

The final answer will be stored in dp[n-1][n]
