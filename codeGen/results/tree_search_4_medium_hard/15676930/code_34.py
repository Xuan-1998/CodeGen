The optimal substructure: We can break down the problem of finding the maximum joy into smaller subproblems of feeding one hare or not, and then combining these solutions to find the overall maximum. This is an example of optimal substructure because the solution to the larger problem depends on the solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

The base case would be when there's only one hare or no hares, in which case we don't have any choices to make.

We'll consider states as (index of hare being fed, number of adjacent hares that are full). Transitions can be defined based on whether the current hare is adjacent to any full hares or not. The value function could then consider the different cases depending on how many adjacent hares are full and which ones need feeding.

Let's use a 2D table with dimensions (n, k) where n is the number of hares and k is the maximum number of adjacent hares that can be full. We'll initialize the base case values and then fill up the table using bottom-up dynamic programming. The final answer will be the value in the cell corresponding to the last hare being fed.

We should also consider edge cases, such as when there are no hares or only one hare, in which case the maximum joy is simply the sum of their respective joy values.

Let's define some helper functions:
