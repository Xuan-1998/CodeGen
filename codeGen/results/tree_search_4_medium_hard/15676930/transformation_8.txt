===BEGIN PLAN===
Identifying overlapping subproblems: The dynamic programming solution can be viewed as a 2D array, where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum total joy that can be obtained by feeding the first i hares and having j hares full.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = maximum total joy obtained by feeding the first i hares, considering whether hare i has adjacent full hares or not.
dp[i][j] = max(a_i + (1 if j == 0 then 0 else dp[i-1][min(j-1, i-1)]) + 
              (1 if j == n-1 then 0 else dp[i-1][max(0, j+1)])) for k in range(min(j, i)),

Use bottom-up dynamic programming with a 2D array to store the maximum total joy for each subproblem.
