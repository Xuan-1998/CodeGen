===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization vs Tabulation: We could use tabulation by creating a 2D array where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum joy for i hares and j full hares.

The state could be a tuple (n, k) representing the number of remaining hares and full hares respectively, with the base case being when n == 0 or k == 0.
Define the state as dp[n][k] = max(dp[i-1][min(k+1, i-1)] + b_i if k == 0 else c_i if k == i-1 else a_i) for i in range(1, n+1), where dp[n][k] represents the maximum joy for n hares and k full hares.

To avoid redundant calculations, initialize the base case as follows: 
dp[0][k] = 0 for k in range(n+1)
For each remaining hare, update the state accordingly:
for i in range(1, n+1):
    dp[i][0] = a_i
    for j in range(1, i):
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][min(j+1, i-1)] + b_i if j == 0 else c_i if j == i-1 else a_i)

The final answer would be dp[n][k], where k is the maximum full hares.
