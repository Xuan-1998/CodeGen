===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider an iterative approach to find the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed. Start from the rightmost beacon and iteratively try to add new beacons to the left. Keep track of the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed in each step.

dp[i][j]: The minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed after activating the j-th beacon and considering only the first i beacons.
dp[i][j] is equal to min(dp[k][j-1] + 1 for k in range(i+1)) if the j-th beacon has no power to destroy any of the previous beacons.

Utilize a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D array with size (n+1) x (max_power + 1), filling it in a bottom-up manner from right to left, and returning the value at dp[n][max_power].

Sort the input beacons based on their positions.
For each beacon, calculate its power range [a_i - b_i, a_i] and update the dynamic programming array accordingly.

Return the value at dp[n][max_power].
