Dynamic programming approach: Consider a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j.

dp[0][j] = j (base case, since no previously activated beacons will be affected by this new beacon's activation)

For i > 0:
    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][max(0, j-b_i)] + 1, dp[i-1][k] + 1) for k in range(max(0, j-b_i), j+1)
    (consider adding a new beacon at position i with power j, and then consider all possible positions of previously activated beacons)
