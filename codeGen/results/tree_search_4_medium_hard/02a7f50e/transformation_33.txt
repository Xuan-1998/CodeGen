===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be viewed as finding the maximum value in a prefix sum array, which can be solved using binary search or segmented tree
State: dp[i] represents the maximum power level of a beacon that can be added to the right of the i-th beacon without destroying any existing beacons.
Let dp[i] be the minimum number of beacons destroyed if exactly one more beacon with power level b_i was added after all beacons up to position a_i.

The plan is correct, but it's not enough. Here's an updated version:

State: dp[i] represents the maximum power level of a beacon that can be added to the right of the i-th beacon without destroying any existing beacons.
Let dp[i] be the minimum number of beacons destroyed if exactly one more beacon with power level b_i was added after all beacons up to position a_i.

Initialization: dp[0] = 0, as no destruction is needed initially

Transition: for each i from 1 to n-1
    - calculate the maximum power level that can be added without destroying any existing beacons (let's call it m)
    - if b_i <= m, then the number of destroyed beacons remains the same as before (dp[i-1])
    - else, the new beacon destroys dp[i-1] beacons and itself is destroyed by one more beacon with power level m
    - update dp[i] to be the minimum of these two cases

Final answer: return dp[n-1]

This plan includes edge cases: it handles the case where no destruction is needed initially (when i=0) and correctly calculates the minimum number of beacons destroyed for each subsequent position.
