State:
    dp[i] represents the maximum power level that can be added to the right of the first i beacons without destroying any existing beacons.

Transition function:
    dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], max(bi - ai for ai in range(i)))
    where bi is the power level of the i-th beacon and ai are the positions of the previous beacons

Initialization: 
    dp[0] = 0 (no beacons to consider)

Goal:
    Return the minimum number of beacons that can be destroyed, which is equal to the maximum value in the dp array.
