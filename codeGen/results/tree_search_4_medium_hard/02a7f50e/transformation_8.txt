===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming approach: Consider a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j and all previously activated beacons are still active.
The state is dp[i-1][k] where i is the position of the newly added beacon and k is its power level, considering all previously activated beacons.

dp[0][j] = 0 for all j (base case: no previous beacons)

For each position i and power level j:
    Initialize dp[i][j] to infinity
    Iterate over all possible positions p and powers q such that |p-i| <= j
        If the newly added beacon at position i with power j does not destroy any previously activated beacons, then update dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[p][q])
    Return dp[n-1][j]
