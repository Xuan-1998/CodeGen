Dynamic programming approach: Consider a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j.

The initial value for dp[0][j] (for all 1 ≤ j ≤ 1,000,000) should be set to 0 because no destruction occurs when there are no activated beacons.

For each 0 ≤ i < n and 1 ≤ j ≤ 1,000,000: dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][max(0,j-b_k)] + (i-k) for k in range(i)).

This plan considers the effects of all previously activated beacons. The minimum number of destructions is calculated by considering each possible position and power level of the newly added beacon, taking into account how many previously destroyed beacons are affected.

To avoid counting the same destruction multiple times, only consider positions where the new beacon would destroy a different number of previously destroyed beacons compared to the previous activation. This is achieved by iterating from right to left (i.e., considering all possible positions for the newly added beacon).

The plan does not include edge cases but can be extended to handle them if needed.
