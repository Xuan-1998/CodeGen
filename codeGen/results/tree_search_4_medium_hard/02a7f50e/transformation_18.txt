Dynamic programming approach: Consider a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][min(j, b_k)] + 1 for k in range(i))

Create a 2D DP table with dimensions n x (max(b_i) + 1) to store the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed

The plan is correct, but it can be improved by initializing the DP table correctly. The DP state should be initialized as follows:

dp[i][j] = i if j < a_0
dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][min(j, b_k)] + 1 for k in range(i)) otherwise

This is because if no beacon has been activated with power less than or equal to j, then the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed is i.

The plan does not include edge cases. To handle edge cases, we should check if the input n and b_i are within the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) and (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1,000,000, 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 1,000,000). If not, return an error message.

The plan is correct and can be implemented as follows:
