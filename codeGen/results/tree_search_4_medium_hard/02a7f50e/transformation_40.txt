===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j]: The minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed after activating the j-th beacon and considering only the first i beacons.

dp[i][0] is 0 for all i, because there are no beacons to the left of the first one.
For each i from 1 to n:
    dp[i][j]: The minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed after activating the j-th beacon and considering only the first i beacons.
    If the j-th beacon can destroy all previous beacons, then dp[i][j] is min(dp[k-1][k-1] + 1 for k in range(1, j+1)) because we need to add this new beacon and also consider the minimum number of beacons destroyed by each previous one.
    Else, dp[i][j] is dp[i-1][j].
Store all these values in a dictionary memo where the key is the state (i.e., which ones have been destroyed) and the value is the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed in that state.

After filling up the dp table, return dp[n][n], which represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed after activating all beacons.
