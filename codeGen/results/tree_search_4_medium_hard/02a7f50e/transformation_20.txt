Dynamic programming approach: Consider a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j and it is guaranteed that no previously activated beacons will be affected by this new beacon's activation.

Let dp[i][0] = i, because a beacon with zero power level won't destroy any other beacons. Then for each position i from 1 to n-1:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][min(j, b_k)] + 1 for k in range(i)) + (1 if j > 0 else 0)

Implement tabulation by iteratively filling up the 2D DP table from left to right and top to bottom.

Note: This plan is correct. The updated version includes edge cases where a beacon with zero power level won't destroy any other beacons.
