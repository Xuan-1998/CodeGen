===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider an iterative approach to find the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed. Start from the rightmost beacon and iteratively try to add new beacons to the left. Keep track of the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed in each step.

dp[i][j]: The minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed after activating the j-th beacon and considering only the first i beacons.
dp[i][j] is equal to min(dp[i-1][k-1] + 1 for k in range(j)) if all beacons from position a_j-1 to a_1 have been destroyed, else dp[i-1][j].
Use dynamic programming with a 2D array and iterate over the beacons from right to left, considering each beacon's position and power level.

For the base case, initialize dp[0][i] for all i. Since there are no beacons to consider yet, the minimum number of destroyed beacons is always 0.
dp[0][j] = 0 for all j

The plan seems correct and considers edge cases. However, it would be beneficial to include more detailed explanations of how the dynamic programming array is initialized and updated. Additionally, a clear outline of the time complexity should be provided.
