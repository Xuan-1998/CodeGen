Dynamic programming approach: Consider a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j and it is guaranteed that no previously activated beacons will be affected by this new beacon's activation.

dp[0][j] = 0 (base case)

for i from 1 to n:
    for j from 1 to max_power:
        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][max(0, j-b_i)] + 1, dp[i-1][k] + 1) for k from 0 to min(j, b_(i-1))
dp[n][*] will be the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added
