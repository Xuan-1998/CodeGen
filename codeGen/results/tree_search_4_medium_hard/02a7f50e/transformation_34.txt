===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be viewed as finding the maximum value in a prefix sum array, which can be solved using binary search or segmented tree
State: dp[i] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one more beacon with power level b_i was added after all beacons up to position a_i.
Let dp[i] = min(dp[j]) + 1 for all j such that a_j < a_i and j != i
Implement memoization by using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.

The correct approach is:
- Initialize an array dp with n+1 elements, where dp[i] is the minimum number of beacons destroyed if exactly one more beacon with power level b_i was added after all beacons up to position a_i.
- Sort the beacons by their positions a_1,...,a_n
- Iterate through the sorted beacons and update dp[i] for each i in O(n log n) time complexity
- Return dp[n]

The plan does not include edge cases but it can be easily extended to handle edge cases.
