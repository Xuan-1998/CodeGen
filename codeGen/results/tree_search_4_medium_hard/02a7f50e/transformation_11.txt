Dynamic programming approach: Consider a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if a beacon at position i with power j is just about to be activated, considering the effects of all previously activated beacons. 

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j, considering all previously activated beacons. Then, for each 0 ≤ i < n and 1 ≤ j ≤ 1,000,000: 
dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j-1] + (i-k) for k in range(i)). 

The plan is correct but it can be improved by initializing the DP table with base cases. The base case should be when i=0 and any j. In this case, dp[0][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position 0 with power j.

The plan also does not include edge cases but it can be easily extended to handle them by considering all possible inputs for i and j.

Here's an updated version of the entire detailed plan:
