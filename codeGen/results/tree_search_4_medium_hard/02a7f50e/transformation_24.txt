Dynamic programming approach: Consider a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j.

1. Initialize the DP table:
   dp[0][0] = n (all n beacons need to be considered initially)
   
2. Iterate over each new beacon's position and power level:
   For each pair of (i, j):
     1. Calculate the number of previously activated beacons that will be destroyed by this new beacon: 
         Let p = sum(1 for k in range(n) if a_k <= i and b_k >= j)
     2. Update dp[i][j] to be the minimum value between:
         - The current number of previously activated beacons (dp[i-1][p-1])
         - Add 1 to p, because this new beacon will also need to be considered
           for future calculations

   For example, if we have three beacons at positions [2, 5, 8] with powers [10, 15, 20]:
     dp[0][0] = 3
     dp[1][10] = 3 (no beacons will be destroyed by the first one)
     dp[2][10] = 2 (the second beacon will destroy one of the previous ones)
     dp[5][15] = 2 (the third beacon will not destroy any previously activated beacons)
     dp[8][20] = 1 (only this new beacon needs to be considered)

3. The minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed is stored in dp[n-1][max(beacon powers)]
