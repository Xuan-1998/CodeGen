Dynamic programming approach: Consider a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if a beacon at position i with power j is just about to be activated, considering the effects of all previously activated beacons.

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j, considering all previously activated beacons. Then, for each 0 ≤ i < n and 1 ≤ j ≤ 1,000,000: 
dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j-1] + (i-k) for k in range(i)).

To avoid redundant calculations, memoization using a dictionary can be used to store the results of subproblems. This will reduce the time complexity from exponential to polynomial.

The plan considers edge cases such as i being 0 and j being less than or equal to 1.
