===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming approach: Consider a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j and all previously activated beacons are still active. The state is dp[i][j] where i represents the number of beacons to the left of the newly added one and j represents the power level of the newly added one.

The base case would be when there's only one beacon, in which case no beacons can be destroyed.
Implementing memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary for faster retrieval. To calculate dp[i][j], we need to consider all possible powers k that are less than or equal to j and calculate the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i-1 with power k.
The optimal solution would be the minimum value obtained from these subproblems.
