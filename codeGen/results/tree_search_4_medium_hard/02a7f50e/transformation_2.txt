Dynamic programming approach: Consider a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j.

dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, because there is no beacon to destroy when the newly added beacon's position is 0.

For i > 0 and each j, calculate dp[i][j] as follows:

* If j <= previous_power:
    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + 1 for k in range(previous_power+1)) where previous_power is the power level of the previously activated beacon.
* If j > previous_power:
    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + 1 for k in range(j, previous_power, -1))

The state is (i, j) where i represents the current position and j represents the current power level of the beacon being added.

dp[0][j] = 0 for all j because there is no beacon to destroy when the newly added beacon's position is 0.
