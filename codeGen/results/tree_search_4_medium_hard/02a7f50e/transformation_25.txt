===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming approach: Consider a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[k-1][max(0, j-1)] + 1 for k in range(i+1) if k not in memo or memo[k-1][j-1]) - 1

Create a dictionary memo where keys are (i, j) tuples and values are the calculated dp[i][j] values for later retrieval.

Memoization helps to avoid redundant calculations by storing the results of subproblems for later reuse.
