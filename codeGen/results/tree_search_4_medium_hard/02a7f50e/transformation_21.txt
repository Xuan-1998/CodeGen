===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming approach: Consider a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j, considering all previously activated beacons will be affected by this new beacon's activation.
dp[i][j] = min(dp[k-1][max(0, j-b_k)] + 1 for k in range(i+1))
Memoizing the table by iterating through it and updating values as you go
The minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed is dp[n-1][max(dp[0..n-2])]
===END PLAN===
