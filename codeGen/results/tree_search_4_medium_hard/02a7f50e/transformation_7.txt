===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming approach:
Consider a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j.
dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j and all previously activated beacons are still active.
The state is dp[i-1][k] where i is the position of the newly added beacon and k is its power level, considering all previously activated beacons.

Let's initialize dp[0][j] for 0 ≤ j ≤ 1,000,000 as the number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position 0 with power j. This can be calculated by iterating over all positions and calculating the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed.

To calculate dp[i][j], iterate over all positions k < i such that dp[k][b_k] ≥ j. For each such k, subtract 1 from the count of destroyed beacons because one less beacon will be destroyed if we add a new beacon at position i with power j.
Consider a dictionary memo to store the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed based on the power level and previous activated beacons.

For the final answer, return dp[n-1][max_power], where max_power is the maximum power level among all beacons.
