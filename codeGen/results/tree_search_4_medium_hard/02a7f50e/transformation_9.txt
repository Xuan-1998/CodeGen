===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming approach: Consider a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if a beacon at position i with power j is just about to be activated, considering the effects of all previously activated beacons. 

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j, considering all previously activated beacons. Then, for each 0 ≤ i < n and 1 ≤ j ≤ 1,000,000: 
dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j-1] + (i-k) for k in range(i))

To improve the plan:
We should sort the beacons by their positions first. This is because we only consider the effects of previously activated beacons when determining dp[i][j]. By sorting the beacons, we can ensure that all previously activated beacons are taken into account.

Potential issues with the plan: 
1. The plan doesn't handle edge cases properly. For example, what if there are no beacons to the left of the new beacon? In this case, dp[i][j] should be 0.
2. The plan assumes that all previously activated beacons have a power level less than or equal to j. However, in reality, some previously activated beacons may have a higher power level.
