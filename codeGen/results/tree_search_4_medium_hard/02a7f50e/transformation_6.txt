===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming approach: Consider a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position i with power j.

We need to consider all previously activated beacons, so let's sort the input by their positions. This will allow us to iterate over the input in order from right to left.

The state is dp[i-1][k] where i is the position of the newly added beacon and k is its power level, considering all previously activated beacons.

To fill up the DP table, we can iterate over each new beacon and for each one, calculate the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed. This will require calculating the maximum power level of a previously activated beacon to the left of the newly added beacon's range.

Let's initialize dp[0][j] = 1 for all j, since no previously activated beacons are present at this point.

Then, we iterate over each new beacon from right to left. For each one, calculate the maximum power level of a previously activated beacon that could still be active after the current beacon is added.

The minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed for the current position and power level will then be the minimum of the current value in the DP table plus 1 (for the newly added beacon) or the value from the previous row minus the maximum power level of a previously activated beacon that could still be active after the current beacon is added.

Finally, we can return dp[n-1][0] as the answer since this represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed if exactly one beacon is added at position n with power 0.
