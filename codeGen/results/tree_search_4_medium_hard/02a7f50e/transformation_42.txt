===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider an iterative approach to find the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed. Start from the rightmost beacon and iteratively try to add new beacons to the left.

Let dp[i][j] represent the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed after activating the j-th beacon and considering only the first i beacons.

dp[i][j] is equal to:
  - min(dp[k][j-1] + 1 for k in range(i+1)) if the j-th beacon has no power to destroy any of the previous beacons.
  - dp[i-1][min(j, max_power)] + 1 otherwise.

Use a 2D array with size (n+1) x (max_power + 1), where:
  - dp[0][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed after activating the j-th beacon without considering any previous beacons.
  - For i > 0, dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of beacons that could be destroyed after activating the j-th beacon and considering only the first i beacons.

Initialize dp[0][j] to 1 for all j in range(max_power + 1), as there is no previous beacon to consider when starting from the rightmost one.
