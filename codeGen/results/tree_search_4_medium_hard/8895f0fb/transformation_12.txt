===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table dp[i][j] to store the number of non-zero carries when adding the first i digits of A and the first j digits of B.
The base case could be when either i or j is equal to 0, indicating that we are considering the first digit of either A or B. In this case, there would be no carry since we can only add single-digit numbers together.

For the transition from dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1], consider whether a carry occurs when adding the i-th digit of A and the j-th digit of B.
If a carry does occur (i.e., their sum is 10 or greater), increment the number of carries by 1. This can be done for all possible pairs of digits in A and B, considering both the i-th digit of A and the j-th digit of B.

The final expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B would be the average number of carries over all possible pairs of digits in A and B.
Use a 1D DP table to store the cumulative sum of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B, where dp[i] represents the cumulative sum of non-zero carries when adding the first i digits of A and B. The base case could be when i is equal to N, indicating that we have processed all the digits in A.
