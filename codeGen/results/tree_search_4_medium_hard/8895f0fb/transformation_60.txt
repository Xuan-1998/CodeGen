state: dp[i] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A with i digits and B with N-i digits.

The transition relationship is based on considering each digit position from right to left, and calculating the cumulative sum of carries at that position. The key insight is that for a given pair (A, B), we can calculate the expected number of non-zero carries by considering all possible pairs of A and B where both numbers have i digits.

The transition relationship could be: dp[i] = Î£[0 to N-i] carry(i) * dp[N-i-1-j], where carry(i) is the probability that a digit at position i contributes to a non-zero carry.

To use memoization by storing the expected number of non-zero carries for each pair of (A, B) in a dictionary, we can store the result in a dictionary with key (i, N-i) and value dp[i].

The base case is when i = 0 or N, where there's no carry. The initial state could be initialized as dp[0] = 0.

To calculate the expected number of non-zero carries, we iterate from right to left digit position, and for each digit, we update the expected number based on the cumulative sum of carries at that position.

This plan avoids edge cases by considering all possible pairs of A and B where both numbers have i digits.
