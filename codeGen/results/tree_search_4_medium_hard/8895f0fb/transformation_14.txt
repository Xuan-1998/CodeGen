===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B.

Base case: when i or j is equal to 0, indicating that we are considering the first digit of either A or B. In this case, there would be no carry since we can only add single-digit numbers together.
Use a 1D DP table to store the cumulative sum of non-zero carries for each possible digit value.

Create a 2D DP table with dimensions N x N, where dp[i][j] represents the number of non-zero carries when adding the i-th digit of A and the j-th digit of B. Initialize dp[0][j] to 0 for all j, since there would be no carry for the first digit of either A or B.

Transition rule: calculate the number of non-zero carries when adding the i-th digit of A and the j-th digit of B as follows:

- If i == j, calculate the number of non-zero carries when adding the i-th digit of A and itself.
- Else, calculate the sum of dp[i-1][j] (the number of non-zero carries when adding the (i-1)-th digit of A and the j-th digit of B) and dp[i][j-1] (the number of non-zero carries when adding the i-th digit of A and the (j-1)-th digit of B).

Calculate the expected number of non-zero carries by summing up the values in the DP table and dividing by the total number of pairs.
