===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's a way to use tabulation with a 1D array to keep track of the cumulative sum of carries.

state: dp[i] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B, both with less than or equal to i digits.
dp[i] = (sum of expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B, each with i-1 digits respectively) / (i+1)

Use a loop to fill up the 1D array. For each i, use the recurrence relation provided in your problem statement to update the value of dp[i].

for i from N down to 1:
    if i == 0:
        dp[i] = 0
    else:
        dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * dp[i-1]) / (i+1)

Use the calculated values in the array to find the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B, both with less than or equal to N digits.
The final answer is simply dp[N].
