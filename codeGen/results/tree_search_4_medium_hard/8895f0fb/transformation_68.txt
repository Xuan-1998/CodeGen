state: dp[i][k] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A with k digits and B with i-k digits.

initialization: dp[0][0] = 0 (base case)

transition relationships:
- If there's no carry, then the expected number of non-zero carries is the same as the previous state.
- If a carry occurs, then the expected number of non-zero carries is incremented by 1 and added to the previous state.

final answer: dp[N][0] + dp[N][1] + ... + dp[N][N]
