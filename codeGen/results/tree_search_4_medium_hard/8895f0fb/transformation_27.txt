DP state: (n, carry) where n is the current digit being processed and carry is the number of non-zero carries seen so far.

Let's define a dynamic programming state as (n, k) where n is the current digit being processed and k is the number of non-zero carries seen so far.
Calculate the maximum possible value for each digit (max_value), which will be used to determine if there's a carry or not. max_value = 9 + 1 (since we're considering single-digit numbers up to N).
Initialize a memoization table (dp) with dimensions (N+1, max_value+1). This will store the expected number of non-zero carries for each possible state.
Define base cases:
    - For n=0 and any carry k, the expected number of non-zero carries is 0. (dp[0][k] = 0)
    - For n greater than 0, if there's no carry, then the expected number of non-zero carries is 0 (dp[n][0] = 0).
    - If n is greater than 0 and there's a carry (i.e., k > 0), calculate the expected number of non-zero carries recursively based on the DP state.
Iterate through each digit from right to left (n=N down to 0):
    For each digit:
        Calculate the maximum possible value for this digit (max_value = max(9-A[n-1], B[n-1]))
        If there's a carry (k > 0), update dp[n][k] recursively using the DP state.
        Update dp[n][k] with the expected number of non-zero carries based on the maximum possible value and previous states.

Finally, calculate the total expected number of non-zero carries by summing up all the values in the memoization table (dp[N-1][0 to max_value]) divided by the total number of pairs.
