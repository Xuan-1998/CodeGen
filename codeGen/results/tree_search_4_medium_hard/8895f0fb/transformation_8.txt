===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B.

The state expression could be a 2D table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of non-zero carries when adding A's i-th digit and B's j-th digit. 

Consider using a recursive formula to calculate the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B, by considering the maximum number of digits N as the base case.

Recursively calculate the expected number of carries for smaller values of N based on the carry generated from each pair of digits.

Implement memoization using a dictionary to store the intermediate results for each pair of digits in A and B. This will help avoid redundant calculations.

For each digit in A and B, consider all possible pairs and sum up the non-zero carries. 

Finally, divide the total number of non-zero carries by the total number of pairs to get the expected value.
