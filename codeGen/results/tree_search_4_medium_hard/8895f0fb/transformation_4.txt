===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using two 1D DP tables to store the cumulative sum modulo 10 for each digit position in A and B.

The state expression could be two 1D arrays dp_a[i] and dp_b[i], where dp_a[i] represents the cumulative sum modulo 10 up to the i-th digit position in A, and dp_b[i] represents the cumulative sum modulo 10 up to the i-th digit position in B.

Use these DP tables to calculate the expected number of non-zero carries. For each pair of digits (A_i, B_j) at the i-th and j-th positions, consider two cases: when A_i + B_j >= 10, a carry occurs; otherwise, no carry occurs.

The expected value is calculated by adding up the number of carries in all possible pairs of A and B, and dividing by the total number of pairs. This can be done efficiently using the DP tables.
