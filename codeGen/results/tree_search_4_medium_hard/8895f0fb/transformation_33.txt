===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming Plan:

Let's define a dynamic programming state as (i, j) where i is the current digit in A, j is the current digit in B.

State transition:
- If the digits at positions i and j are both 0, then the number of non-zero carries seen so far k remains unchanged.
- If the sum of the digits at positions i and j is less than or equal to 9, then there is no carry.
- If the sum of the digits at positions i and j is greater than 9, then a carry occurs. We increment k by 1.

Base case:
- The expected number of non-zero carries for A and B when they are both single-digit numbers (i.e., N = 1) is simply the number of pairs that have a sum greater than or equal to 10.

Tabulation:
- Initialize a 2D array dp with dimensions (N+1) x (N+1), where dp[i][j] represents the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B up to the i-th digit in A and j-th digit in B.
- Fill in the base case values first, then fill in the rest of the array using the state transition rules.

Memoization:
- Cache the intermediate results in dp[i][j] so that we don't have to re-compute them multiple times.

Final answer:
- The expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B is simply the value at dp[N][N].
