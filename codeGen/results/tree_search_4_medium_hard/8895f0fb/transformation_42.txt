===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about applying memoization to a recursive function that calculates the expected number of non-zero carries.

DP state: (n, carry) where n is the current digit being processed and carry is a flag indicating if there was a non-zero carry in the previous addition. Consider both cases where A[n] >= B[n] and A[n] < B[n], and use them to determine the expected number of non-zero carries for each state.

Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where the state represents the expected number of non-zero carries after processing up to N digits in A and B. The transition relationship is based on the idea that the expected number of non-zero carries at digit n depends only on the values of the previous carry and the current digits in A and B.

Use a recursive function with memoization to calculate the expected number of non-zero carries for each state (n, carry), and then use the results to fill in the DP table. Initialize the base case where n is 0 or both A and B are 0.
