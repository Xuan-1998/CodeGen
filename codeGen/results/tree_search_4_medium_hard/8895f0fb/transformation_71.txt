===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's a way to use tabulation with a 3D array dp[i][k][l] where i is the maximum number of digits in A and B, k and l are the current number of digits in A and B respectively. Initialize all values to 0.
state: dp[i][k][l] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A with k digits and B with l digits, both with less than or equal to i digits.
dp[i][k][l] = 
    if (k > 0) then
        1/(i+1) * (
            sum of dp[i-1][k-1][l] + 
            sum of dp[i-1][k][l-1] + 
            sum of dp[i-1][k-1][l-1]
        ) 
    else if (l > 0) then
        1/(i+1) * (
            sum of dp[i-1][k][l-1] + 
            sum of dp[i-1][k-1][l]
        )
    else 
        0
Create an array count[i] where i is the maximum number of digits in A and B. Initialize all values to 0.
count[i] = sum of (k + l) for each (k, l) such that k+l <= i.
Finally, calculate the expected value by dividing the total number of carries by the total number of pairs.
expected_value = sum of count[i] * dp[i][0][0] for all i from 1 to N
