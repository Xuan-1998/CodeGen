===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B.

The state expression could be a combination of the current digit's value, whether it has been added before, and the sum of the two digits. This would allow us to keep track of the number of carries for each pair of digits.

A possible base case is when either A or B has no more digits left. In this case, we can simply add up the remaining digits without considering any further carries.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

- Initialize a 2D DP table with dimensions (N+1) x (N+1), where N is the maximum number of digits in A and B.
- Fill in the base cases: when either A or B has no more digits left, add up the remaining digits without considering any further carries.
- Iterate over the digits of A and B from right to left:
  - For each pair of digits, calculate the sum and determine whether a carry occurs (i.e., if the sum is >= 10).
  - Update the DP table accordingly based on the current digit's value, whether it has been added before, and the sum.
- Finally, return the sum of all entries in the DP table as the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B.

This plan should correctly calculate the expected number of non-zero carries when adding two N-digit numbers in base 10 representation. It includes edge cases such as when either A or B has no more digits left.
