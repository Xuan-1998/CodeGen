===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a state as (n, c) where n is the current digit being processed and c is the cumulative carry from previous digits.
Define dp[(n, c)] = expected_number_of_non_zero_carries(n, c), which calculates the expected number of non-zero carries when adding a digit n with a cumulative carry c.
Let dp[(0, 0)] be the base case, where there are no remaining digits and no cumulative carry. In this case, the expected number of non-zero carries is 0.
For states (n, c) such that n > 0 or c > 0:
    Define a recursive function f(n, c) as follows:
        If n == 0, then return dp[(0, c)]
        Else if c == 0, then return expected_number_of_non_zero_carries(n % 10, 0)
        Else, calculate the number of non-zero carries when adding the current digit to the previous cumulative carry. This is a function of the current digit and the previous cumulative carry.
    Define dp[(n, c)] as the sum of f(n - 1, c) and the expected_number_of_non_zero_carries(n % 10, c)
