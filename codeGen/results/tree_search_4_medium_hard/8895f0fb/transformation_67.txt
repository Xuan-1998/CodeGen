state: dp[i][j] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A with j digits and B with N-j digits.

Initialization:
dp[0][0] = 0 (base case for single-digit numbers)

Transition function:
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + P(i, j) * (1 - 9^(-i)) (cumulative sum of carries when adding i-digit number and (N-i)-digit number)
where P(i, j) is the probability of a non-zero carry in the ith digit

Termination condition:
dp[N][0] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B
