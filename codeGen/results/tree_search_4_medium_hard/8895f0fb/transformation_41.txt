===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about applying memoization to a recursive function that calculates the expected number of non-zero carries.

DP state: (n, carry) where n is the current digit being processed and carry is a flag indicating if there was a non-zero carry in the previous addition.

Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where the state represents the expected number of non-zero carries after processing up to N digits in A and B. The transition relationship is based on the idea that the expected number of non-zero carries at digit n depends only on the values of the previous carry and the current digits in A and B.

Initialize a 2D DP table dp[0..N][0..1] where dp[i][j] represents the expected number of non-zero carries after processing up to i digits in A and B, given that there was a non-zero carry in the previous addition if j is true. Otherwise, it's false.

 Iterate from n=0 to N-1:
    For each n:
        For each possible value of the current digit in A (k) and B (l):
            Calculate the expected number of non-zero carries at digit n based on the values of the previous carry and the current digits k and l.
            Update dp[n][j] where j is the flag indicating if there was a non-zero carry in the previous addition.

Finally, calculate the total expected number of non-zero carries by summing up all entries in the last row of the DP table (N-1) and divide it by the total number of pairs.
