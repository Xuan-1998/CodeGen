===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's a way to use tabulation with a 1D array to keep track of the cumulative sum of carries.
state: dp[i] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B with i digits in total.
dp[i] = dp[i-1] * (10 - p) + p, where p is the probability that the last digit is not zero
Create a 2D array to store the expected number of non-zero carries for each possible sum and digit count.
state: dp[n][k] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B with n digits in total and k as the most significant digit.
dp[0][0] = 0 (base case)
for i from 1 to N:
    for j from 0 to 9:
        if j > k: dp[n][k] += 1
        else: dp[n][k] += (j == k) * (10 - j)
Return the sum of all entries in the 2D array, divided by the total number of pairs.
state: res = sum(dp[i][j]) / (N+1)^2
