===BEGIN PLAN===
DP state: (n, carry) where n is the current digit being processed and carry is a flag indicating if there was a non-zero carry in the previous addition.

To calculate the expected number of non-zero carries for A and B up to N digits, we need to consider all possible pairs of N-digit numbers. We can use memoization to avoid redundant computations. The transition relationship can be represented as:

dp(n, carry) = (sum of expected number of non-zero carries at previous digit n-1) * probability of having a non-zero carry in the current addition

To calculate this probability, we need to consider all possible combinations of A and B's digits up to N. For each combination, if there was a non-zero carry, we add 1 to the expected number of non-zero carries.

Base case: dp(0, 0) = 0 (no carries when adding 0)

Top-down approach:
- Start with base case
- Calculate dp(n, carry) using transition relationship and memoization
- Recursively calculate dp(n-1, carry') for all possible values of carry'
- Repeat until n == 0
