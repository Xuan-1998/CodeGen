===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B. The state expression could be dp[i][j] = 1 + (dp[i-1][j-1] if i > 0 && j > 0) + (dp[i-1][j] if i > 0) + (dp[i][j-1] if j > 0), simulating the process of adding two digits.
The base case could be when both A and B are single-digit numbers, in which case there is no carry. The DP table size can be set as N*N to accommodate for all pairs of digits.
