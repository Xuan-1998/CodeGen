===BEGIN PLAN===
We can improve the plan by being more specific about the base case and the recursive relationship.

DP state: (n, carry) where n is the current digit being processed and carry is the number of non-zero carries seen so far. The base case would be when we've reached the end of the numbers (i.e., n == 0), in which case we just return the current carry value.

Let's define a dynamic programming state as (n, k) where n is the current digit being processed and k is the number of non-zero carries seen so far. We can use a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B up to the ith digit, considering j non-zero carries so far.

The recursive relationship would be: for each pair (n, k), we calculate the expected number of non-zero carries by summing over all possible digits d from 0 to 9 that can be added to the current digit n with carry k. This is because when adding A and B up to the ith digit, considering j non-zero carries so far, the next carry will depend on the result of adding the ith digits of A and B.

The edge cases are handled correctly by the base case (n == 0).
