===BEGIN PLAN===
DP state: (n, carry) where n is the current digit being processed and carry is a boolean flag indicating if there was a non-zero carry in the previous addition.

Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where the state represents the expected number of non-zero carries after processing up to N digits in A and B. The transition relationship is based on the idea that the expected number of non-zero carries at digit n depends only on the values of the current digits in A and B, and whether there was a carry from the previous addition.

The DP state can be represented as (n, 0) or (n, 1), where 0 represents no carry and 1 represents a non-zero carry. The base case is when n = N, where the expected number of non-zero carries is 0 if there was no carry at digit N, and 1 if there was.

To fill in the DP table, iterate through each digit from n = N down to n = 1. For each digit, consider all possible values of A and B at that digit, and calculate the expected number of non-zero carries based on whether there was a carry from the previous addition. Store the result in the DP table for the corresponding state (n, carry).

Finally, return the value stored in the DP table for the initial state (0, 0), which represents the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B.
