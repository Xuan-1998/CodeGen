===BEGIN PLAN===
DP state: (n, carry) where n is the current digit being processed and carry is a flag indicating if there was a non-zero carry in the previous addition.

For each pair of digits at position n, calculate the expected number of non-zero carries by considering all possible combinations of 0-9 as input for the two digits.

Create a dictionary to store the expected number of non-zero carries for each digit and carry state, where the key is (n, carry).

Base case: when n = 0, return 0.

Recursive case:

* If there was no carry in the previous addition (carry = False), calculate the expected number of non-zero carries by considering all possible combinations of 0-9 as input for the two digits at position n.
	+ Initialize a variable to store the total expected number of non-zero carries.
	+ Iterate over each combination of 0-9 as input for the two digits at position n.
	+ For each combination, calculate the expected number of non-zero carries by recursively calling the function with the updated values of n and carry.
	+ Add up the expected number of non-zero carries from all combinations to the total variable.
* If there was a non-zero carry in the previous addition (carry = True), the expected number of non-zero carries is simply the sum of the expected number of non-zero carries for each possible combination of 0-9 as input for the two digits at position n.

Edge cases:
	+ Handle the case where A and B have different lengths by padding the shorter number with zeros.
	+ Handle the case where A or B is zero by returning 0 (since there will be no non-zero carries).
