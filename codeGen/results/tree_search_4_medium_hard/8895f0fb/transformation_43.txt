===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using Dynamic Programming, let's refine our initial plan:
DP state: (n, carry) where n is the current digit being processed and carry is a flag indicating if there was a non-zero carry in the previous addition.

Top-down dynamic programming approach:
- Calculate the expected number of non-zero carries after adding all possible pairs of N-digit numbers in A and B.
- The transition relationship depends on the values of the previous carry, the current digits in A and B, and the total number of pairs processed so far.

Memoization using a dictionary to store subproblem results:
- Store the expected number of non-zero carries for each (n, carry) state.
- Reuse the stored results when needed to avoid redundant calculations.

Improved plan:
1. Initialize an empty dictionary dp to store subproblem results.
2. Define a recursive function calculate_carries(n) that takes an integer n representing the current digit being processed and returns the expected number of non-zero carries after adding all possible pairs of N-digit numbers in A and B.
3. In the calculate_carries(n) function:
   - Base case: If n is 0, return 0 (no carries).
   - Recursively call calculate_carries(n-1) with the previous carry set to 1 if the current digit's sum exceeds 10, or 0 otherwise.
   - Store the calculated result in dp[(n, previous carry)].
4. Main function:
   - Initialize a variable total_carries = 0 to store the expected number of non-zero carries after adding all possible pairs of N-digit numbers in A and B.
   - Iterate through each digit n from N to 1:
      - Calculate the expected number of non-zero carries for this digit using dp[(n, previous carry)].
      - Update total_carries accordingly.
5. Return the calculated total_carries as the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B.

Edge cases:
- Handle edge case where N is 0 (no digits in A or B).
- Handle edge case where A or B contains only one digit (no addition needed).
