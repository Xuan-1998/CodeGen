===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about applying memoization to a recursive function that calculates the expected number of non-zero carries.

DP state: (n, carry) where n is the current digit being processed and carry is a flag indicating if there was a non-zero carry in the previous addition. For each pair of digits at position n, calculate the expected number of non-zero carries by considering all possible combinations of 0-9 as input for the two digits.

Initialize a dictionary dp with default value 0 to store the expected number of non-zero carries.
Base case: if n is 0, return 0 (no more carries).

Recursive step:
    - For each pair of digits at position n, calculate the expected number of non-zero carries by considering all possible combinations of 0-9 as input for the two digits. 
    - If there was a carry from the previous addition (carry == 1), add the probability of a non-zero carry occurring in this digit to the total expected number.
    - Otherwise, add the sum of the expected numbers of non-zero carries for both cases: with and without a carry.

Update dp[(n, carry)] with the calculated expected number.
