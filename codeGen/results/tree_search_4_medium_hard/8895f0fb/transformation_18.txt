===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B.

A possible state expression could be dp[i][j] = 1 if adding A's i-th digit to B's j-th digit results in a carry, and dp[i][j] = 0 otherwise. This allows us to keep track of the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits.

Base case: The base case is when both A's i-th digit and B's j-th digit are 0. In this case, there will be no carry. So, dp[i][j] = 0 in this base case.

Recursive relation: The recursive relation is based on the idea that adding a pair of digits results in a carry if and only if at least one of the two digits has a value greater than or equal to 5. This means we need to consider all pairs of digits with values from 1 to 9, inclusive.

The updated version of the DP table could be initialized as follows: dp[0][j] = 0 for j in range(N+1), and dp[i][0] = 0 for i in range(N+1).

Finally, we can fill up the DP table by iterating over all pairs of digits (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i ≤ N and 1 ≤ j ≤ N.

The expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B is then calculated as the sum of dp[i][j] for all i and j, divided by the total number of possible pairs.
