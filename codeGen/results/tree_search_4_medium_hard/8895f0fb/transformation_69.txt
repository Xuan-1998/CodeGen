===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's a way to use tabulation with a 1D array to keep track of the cumulative sum of carries.

state: dp[i] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B, both with less than or equal to i digits.

dp[i] represents the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B, both with less than or equal to i digits. In this case, transition relationships could be formulated based on whether a carry occurs in the current column or not.

Implement tabulation by iterating over all possible values for the current digit (0-9) and then calculate the expected number of non-zero carries based on whether a carry occurs in the current column or not.

Calculate dp[i] as follows:
1. Initialize dp[0] to 0.
2. For each i from 1 to N, calculate dp[i] = (sum of expected carries when adding A and B with less than or equal to i-1 digits) * (expected number of non-zero carries in the current digit).
3. Calculate the expected number of non-zero carries in the current digit based on whether a carry occurs or not.
