===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B. The state expression could be dp[i][j] = number of non-zero carries when adding the i-th digit of A and the j-th digit of B.
The base case could be when either A or B has no more digits left, at which point there are no more pairs of digits to consider. This would allow us to recursively calculate the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in O(N) time.

To initialize the DP table, we can start by considering the case where one of the numbers (say A) has only one digit left and the other number B has N-1 digits left. In this case, there will be a carry if the value of the last digit in A is greater than or equal to 5.

From here, we can recursively calculate the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in O(N) time by considering the possibilities where either the current digit in A or B has a non-zero carry, and propagating this information forward in the DP table.

To avoid over-counting, we can use memoization to store the results of sub-problems as we solve them, allowing us to reuse these results when needed.
