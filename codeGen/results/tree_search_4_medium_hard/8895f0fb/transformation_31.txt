===BEGIN PLAN===
DP state: (n, carry) where n is the current digit being processed and carry is the number of non-zero carries seen so far.

Let's define a dynamic programming state as (i, j, k) where i is the current digit in A, j is the current digit in B, and k is the number of non-zero carries seen so far.
DP state: Create a 3D array dp with dimensions N+1 x (N+1) x (N+1) to store the expected number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits.

Base case: When n = 0, the expected number of non-zero carries is k (carry seen so far).

Recurrence relation:
dp[i][j][k] = 1/10 * (sum of possibilities for next digit in A and B) + dp[i-1][j-1][k+1] * (probability that current carry propagates to next digit)
where sum of possibilities is the sum of probabilities for each possible combination of digits in A and B, which can be calculated using a similar recursive formula.

Finally, calculate the expected number of non-zero carries by summing up dp[i][j][k] over all k (number of non-zero carries) and dividing by the total number of pairs.
