===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B.
The state expression could be a 2D table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of non-zero carries when adding A's i-th digit and B's j-th digit.

Instead of considering all pairs of digits, consider only the pairs that have a carry. This can be done by iterating over the maximum number of digits N.
For each pair of digits (A's i-th and B's j-th), calculate the total sum and check if it has a carry (i.e., greater than or equal to 10). If it does, increment dp[i][j] by 1.

To avoid redundant computation, use memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary.
Initialize a variable cum_carries to store the cumulative number of non-zero carries for all pairs of digits. This can be used to calculate the expected value at the end.
