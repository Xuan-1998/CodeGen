===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's a way to use tabulation with a 2D array dp[i][j] to keep track of the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A with i digits and B with N-j digits.

state: dp[i][j] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A with i digits and B with N-j digits.
The transition relationship could be based on considering each digit position from right to left, and calculating the cumulative sum of carries at that position.

Initialization:
dp[0][0] = 0 // base case

Transition:
for i in range(1, N+1):
    for j in range(0, min(i, N)+1): // consider up to i digits in A and j digits in B
        if i > j: // more digits in A than B
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] + 10 ** (N - j) * (i-j)) / (2 ** N)
        elif j > i: // more digits in B than A
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j-1] + 10 ** (N - i) * (j-i)) / (2 ** N)
        else: // same number of digits in both numbers
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + 10 ** (N - j) * (i-j)) / (2 ** N)

Final Answer:
print(sum([dp[i][j] for i in range(N+1) for j in range(min(i, N)+1)]))
