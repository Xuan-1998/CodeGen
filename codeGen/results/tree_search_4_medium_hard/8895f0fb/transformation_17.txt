===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B.
Let dp[i][j] represent the expected number of non-zero carries when adding the ith digit of A to the jth digit of B.
Base case: For single-digit numbers, there are no non-zero carries. So, dp[0][0] = 0.
Inductive step:
For each pair of digits (A[i-1], B[j-1]), calculate the expected number of non-zero carries by considering three possibilities:
    - If A[i-1] and B[j-1] are both less than 5, there is no carry. So, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1].
    - If A[i-1] + B[j-1] >= 10, there is a carry. The expected number of carries is the same as when adding the (i-1)th digit of A to the (j-1)th digit of B. So, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1].
    - If neither condition holds, it means that the sum of the digits is less than 10 but greater or equal to 5. In this case, there will be one carry with probability 0.5 and no carries with probability 0.5. So, dp[i][j] = 0.5 * (dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]).
Final answer: Calculate the sum of all values in the DP table, then divide by N^2 to get the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B.
