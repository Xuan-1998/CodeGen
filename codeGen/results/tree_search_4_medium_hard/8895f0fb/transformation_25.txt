===BEGIN PLAN===
DP state: (n, k) where n is the current digit being processed and k is the number of non-zero carries seen so far.

Let's define two base cases:
1. When processing the last digit (n = N), there are no more digits to process.
2. If carry == 0 or carry >= 10, the expected number of non-zero carries doesn't change.

For the recursive case:

Let dp[n][k] be the expected number of non-zero carries when adding two numbers with n digits and k non-zero carries seen so far.
1. Calculate the number of ways to add the current digit and another digit (0-9) without any carry, considering both A and B have N-digits.
2. For each possible pair:
   - If there is no carry (dp[n-1][k]), add the result to the total expected number of non-zero carries for this subproblem.
   - Otherwise (dp[n-1][k+1]), add the result multiplied by 10 to account for the carry.
3. Calculate the average of these results.

Memoize the recursive function with a dictionary to store the results of subproblems.
