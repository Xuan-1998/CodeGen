===BEGIN PLAN===
DP state: (n, carry) where n is the current digit being processed and carry is a flag indicating if there was a non-zero carry in the previous addition.

1. Initialize a 2D DP table dp with size N+1 x 2.
   - Each cell dp[i][0] represents the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B up to the ith digit, assuming no carry from the (i-1)th digit.
   - Each cell dp[i][1] represents the same as above but with a carry from the (i-1)th digit.

2. Iterate over all pairs of digits in A and B.
   - For each pair of digits ai and bi, calculate the expected number of non-zero carries at the current digit n by considering two cases: 
     * Case 1: No carry from the previous addition (ai + bi < 10). The expected number of non-zero carries is dp[n-1][0] * ((A[i-1] < 5) and (B[i-1] < 5)) + dp[n-1][1] * (((A[i-1] >= 5) or (B[i-1] >= 5))).
     * Case 2: A carry from the previous addition (ai + bi >= 10). The expected number of non-zero carries is dp[n-1][0] * ((A[i-1] < 5) and (B[i-1] < 5)) + (dp[n-1][1] - dp[n-1][0]).

3. Update the DP table by setting dp[n][0] = min(dp[n][0], case 1 value) and dp[n][1] = max(case 1 value, case 2 value).

4. Calculate the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B by summing up all values in the last row of the DP table (dp[N-1][0] + dp[N-1][1]) / 2.
