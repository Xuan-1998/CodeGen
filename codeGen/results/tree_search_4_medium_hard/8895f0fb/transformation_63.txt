===BEGIN PLAN===
state: dp[i][j] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A with j digits and B with N-j digits.
Consider using dynamic programming with memoization to keep track of previously computed values and avoid redundant calculations.
Determine if there's a way to use tabulation with a 2D array to keep track of the cumulative sum of carries for each digit position (0 to N-1).
Use a dictionary to implement memoization, storing previously computed values as (i, j) tuples as keys and their corresponding expected number of non-zero carries as values.
Pre-compute all possible values of dp[i][j] from 0 to N-1 for i in range(N+1), then iterate through each pair of A and B (with a total of N digits) to calculate the expected number of non-zero carries when adding them together.
