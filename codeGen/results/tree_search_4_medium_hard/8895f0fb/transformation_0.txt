===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B.

The state expression could be a 2D table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the total number of non-zero carries when adding A's i-th digit and B's j-th digit.

Create a 2D DP table with dimensions (N+1) x (N+1) to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B.

Initialize dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there are no carries when adding a zero-digit and any digit.

For i from 1 to N:
    For j from 0 to N:
        If (A's i-th digit + B's j-th digit) >= 10:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
        Else:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]

Calculate the expected number of non-zero carries by summing up all the values in the DP table and dividing by the total number of pairs.
