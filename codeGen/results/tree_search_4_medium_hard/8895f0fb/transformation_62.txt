===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's a way to use tabulation with a 1D array dp[i] to keep track of the cumulative sum of carries for each possible digit sum from 0 to 10*N.

state: dp[i] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B with digits summing up to i.
Use dynamic programming with memoization to keep track of previously computed values and avoid redundant calculations.

To calculate the expected number of non-zero carries, iterate over all possible digit sums from 0 to 10*N. For each sum i, calculate the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B with digits summing up to i. This can be done by considering all possible pairs of A and B with digits summing up to i, calculating the total number of pairs, and then dividing by the total number of pairs to get the average.

Use the calculated value dp[i] to update the cumulative sum for each possible digit sum from 0 to 10*N. This can be done by iterating over all possible digit sums and updating the cumulative sum accordingly.

Finally, return the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B with digits summing up to 10*N. This value is stored in dp[10*N].
