===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a state as (n, c) where n is the current digit being processed and c is the cumulative carry from previous digits.

DP state: dp[(n, c)] = min(1 + c, 9 - int(n)), where n is the current digit and c is the cumulative carry.
The expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B can be calculated as the sum of all possible pairs of (A[i], B[j]) for i from 0 to N-1 and j from 0 to N-1.

Initialize dp state: dp[(0, 0)] = 0
Iterate over all digits n from 1 to N:
    For each digit n:
        Iterate over all cumulative carries c from 0 to min(n, 9 - int(n)):
            Calculate the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B as the sum of all possible pairs of (A[i], B[j]) for i from 0 to N-1 and j from 0 to N-1.
