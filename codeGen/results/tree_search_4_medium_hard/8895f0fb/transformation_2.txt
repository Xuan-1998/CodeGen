===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 1D DP table to store the total number of non-zero carries for each possible sum of A and B's digits. 
The state expression could be an array dp[i] where dp[i] represents the total number of non-zero carries when adding A and B with i as the maximum possible sum.
Design a recursive function that calculates the total number of non-zero carries by considering the carry from the previous addition operation and using memoization to optimize the calculation.
The base case could be when the current digit is 0, in which case there are no non-zero carries.
The recursive step would consider all possible values for A's current digit and B's current digit (i.e., 1-9), calculate the total number of non-zero carries if a carry occurs or not, and add that to the total number of non-zero carries from the previous addition operation.
Finally, return the total number of non-zero carries as the result.
