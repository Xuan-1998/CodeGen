===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about applying memoization to a recursive function that calculates the expected number of non-zero carries.

DP state: (n, carry) where n is the current digit being processed and carry is the total cumulative carry from previous digits. 

Consider two cases:
1. The current digit is 0. In this case, there are no more non-zero carries.
2. The current digit is not 0. In this case, we need to calculate the expected number of non-zero carries considering both the current digit and the cumulative carry.

Use memoization to store the expected number of non-zero carries for each possible pair (n, c) where n is the current digit being processed and c is the total cumulative carry from previous digits.

Consider edge cases:
- What if one or both numbers have a single digit? In this case, there are no non-zero carries.
- What if one or both numbers have no digits left to process? In this case, we can return 0 as there are no more non-zero carries.
