===BEGIN PLAN===
DP state: (n, k) where n is the current digit in A, and k is the number of non-zero carries seen so far.

Define a dynamic programming state as (i, j, k) where i is the current digit in A, j is the current digit in B, and k is the number of non-zero carries seen so far.
Memoize the recursive function that calculates the expected number of non-zero carries by using a dictionary or a cache data structure.

Calculate the expected number of non-zero carries for each pair (i, j) where 0 ≤ i < N and 0 ≤ j < N as follows:

1. Initialize k to be 0.
2. Calculate the sum of the current digits in A and B: s = A[i] + B[j]
3. If s >= 10:
    a. Increment k by 1
    b. Recursively calculate the expected number of non-zero carries for (i-1, j-1) with carry k
4. Otherwise:
    a. Do nothing and continue to the next pair
5. Return k

To improve this plan:

* Instead of using a recursive function, use dynamic programming with bottom-up approach to reduce time complexity.
* Initialize memoization dictionary with base cases (i.e., when i or j is 0) before filling up the rest of the table.

Potential issues with the plan:
* The plan does not account for edge cases where A or B has fewer digits than N. To handle this, add additional checks to ensure that i and j are within valid bounds.
* The plan assumes that A and B have the same number of digits, but this is not explicitly stated in the problem statement. To handle this, adjust the DP state to account for different lengths of A and B.
