===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B.

The base case could be when i is equal to 0, indicating that we are considering the first digit of A. In this case, there would be no carry since we can only add single-digit numbers together.

The recursive relation could be as follows:
- dp[i][j] = 1 if (A[i] + B[j]) >= 10
- dp[i][j] = 0 otherwise

The base cases are:
- dp[0][j] = 0 for all j
- dp[i][0] = 0 for all i

To calculate the expected number of non-zero carries, we need to sum up all the values in the DP table and divide by the total number of pairs.

The final answer would be: (1/10^(N*N)) * Î£(dp[i][j])
