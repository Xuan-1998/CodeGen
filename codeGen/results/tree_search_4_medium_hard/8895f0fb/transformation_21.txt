===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B. 
The state could be (dp[i][j], i, j) where dp[i][j] represents the number of non-zero carries when adding the ith digit of A with the jth digit of B.
A possible base case is when both digits are 0 or they sum up to less than 10, in which case there would be no carry. 
The transition relationship would involve considering the current digits' values and whether they have been added before.
Implement memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary, where the key is the state (i, j) and the value is the number of non-zero carries for that pair of digits.

To calculate the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B, iterate over each digit in both numbers, considering all possible pairs of digits. 
For each pair, look up the corresponding value in the DP table and add it to a running total.
Finally, divide this total by the total number of pairs (which is N^2) to get the expected number of non-zero carries.
