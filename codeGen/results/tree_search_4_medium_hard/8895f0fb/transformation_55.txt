===BEGIN PLAN===
state: dp[i] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A with i digits and B with N-i digits.

1. Initialize the 1D array dp of size (N+1) with all elements set to 0.
2. For each digit position from left to right, calculate the cumulative sum of carries for that position.
3. Let dp[i] represent the expected number of non-zero carries when adding an i-digit number and a (N-i)-digit number.
4. Use the recurrence relation: dp[i] = (sum of carries at current position) + dp[i-1], where sum of carries at current position is calculated by considering all possible pairs of A and B.
5. For the base case, when i=0, set dp[0] = 0, since there are no digits to add.
