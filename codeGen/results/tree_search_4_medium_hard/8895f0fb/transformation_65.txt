===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's a way to use tabulation with a 1D array to keep track of the cumulative sum of carries.

state: dp[i] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B both having i digits.

dp[0] = 0 (base case)

for i from 1 to N:
    for j from 0 to i:
        if j == 0 or j == i:
            dp[i] += carry_prob * 10^(N-i)
        else:
            dp[i] += dp[j-1][i-j] + (carry_prob * 10^(N-i))

Use a 1D array dp of size N+1 to keep track of the cumulative sum of carries at each digit position, then calculate the expected value based on this array.

Expected value = Î£(dp[i] / (2^N)) for i from 0 to N
