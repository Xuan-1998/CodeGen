===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's a way to use tabulation with a 1D array to keep track of the cumulative sum of carries.

state: dp[i] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A with i digits and B with N-i digits.
Consider using dynamic programming with memoization to keep track of previously computed values and avoid redundant calculations.

dp[i] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A with i digits and B with N-i digits, iterate through the array in a bottom-up manner to fill up the table.
For each digit position from left to right:
    Iterate through all possible combinations of A's i-1 and B's N-(i-1) digits
    Calculate the expected number of non-zero carries for that combination
    Add it to dp[i]
Iterate through the array in a top-down manner to get the final answer.
dp[0] = 0 (base case)
For each digit position from right to left:
    Calculate the expected number of non-zero carries by considering all possible combinations of A's and B's digits
    Add it to dp[i]
Return dp[N]
