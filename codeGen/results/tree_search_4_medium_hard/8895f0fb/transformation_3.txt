===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B.
The state expression could be a 2D table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of non-zero carries when adding A's i-th digit and B's j-th digit, with the base case being when both digits are zero.

Create a 1D DP table to store the cumulative sum modulo 10 for each digit position in A.
The state expression could be an array dp[i] where dp[i] represents the cumulative sum modulo 10 up to the i-th digit position in A.

Create another 1D DP table to store the cumulative sum modulo 10 for each digit position in B.
The state expression could be an array dp[i] where dp[i] represents the cumulative sum modulo 10 up to the i-th digit position in B.

Create a 2D DP table with dimensions N x N, where dp[i][j] represents the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A's i-th digit and B's j-th digit.
The base case could be when both digits are zero, where the expected number of non-zero carries is zero. 

Fill in the 2D DP table by iterating over each pair of digits in A and B, and for each pair, calculate the expected number of non-zero carries as the sum of the product of the current digit of A and the cumulative sum modulo 10 up to that position in B, plus the cumulative sum modulo 10 up to that position in A.

The final answer could be the average of the values in the 2D DP table.
