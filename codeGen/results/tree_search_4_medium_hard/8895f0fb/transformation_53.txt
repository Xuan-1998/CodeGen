state: dp[i] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B with i digits in total.
dp[i] = min(9-i+dp[i-1], max(0,10-dp[i-1]-5)) to model the process of adding two N-digit numbers in base 10 representation
Initialize a 1D array dp[N+1] with all elements set to 0
iterate through each possible pair of digits (0-9) for the most significant digit
    update dp[i] based on the cumulative sum of carries

state: dp[1] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B with 1 digit in total.
dp[1] = min(9-dp[0], max(0,10-dp[0]-5))

state: dp[2] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B with 2 digits in total.
dp[2] = min(8+dp[1], max(0,10-dp[1]-5))

state: dp[3] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B with 3 digits in total.
dp[3] = min(7+dp[2], max(0,10-dp[2]-5))
