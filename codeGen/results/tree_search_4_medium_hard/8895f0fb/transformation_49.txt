state: dp[i] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B with i digits in total.
1. Initialize a 1D array dp of size N+1, where dp[i] represents the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B with i digits in total.
2. Iterate over the range of N (0 to N), updating the dp array by considering all possible pairs of A and B:
   - For each pair j and k such that j+k=i, calculate the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B with i digits in total as dp[i] = dp[j] * dp[k]
   - Update dp[i] with the calculated value
3. The final answer is the sum of all values in the dp array from index 1 to N (excluding the first element, which represents the case where both numbers have 0 digits).
