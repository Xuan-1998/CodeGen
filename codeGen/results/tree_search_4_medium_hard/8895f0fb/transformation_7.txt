===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B.
The state expression could be a 2D table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of non-zero carries when adding A's i-th digit and B's j-th digit.
Maintain a separate 1D array sum[N+1] to store the cumulative sum of non-zero carries, where sum[i] represents the total number of non-zero carries when adding the first i digits of A and B.

Initialize dp[0][j] = 0 for all j because there are no carries in single-digit numbers.
For each i from 1 to N:
    For each j from 0 to N:
        If i-th digit of A is greater than or equal to (10 - j), increment sum[i] by 1. This represents the number of non-zero carries when adding the i-th digit of A and B's j-th digit.
        Update dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + (A's i-th digit is greater than or equal to (10 - k)) for all k from 0 to N) because the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A's i-th digit and B's j-th digit is the minimum number of non-zero carries when adding A's (i-1)-th digit and B's k-th digit for all k, plus one if A's i-th digit is greater than or equal to 5.
Return sum[N] / ((N+1)*(N+2)/2) as the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B.
