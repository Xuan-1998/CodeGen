===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B.
The base case could be when i or j is equal to N, indicating that we are considering the last digit of either A or B. In this case, there would be no carry since we can only add single-digit numbers together.

Initially, fill the DP table with zeros, as we haven't processed any pairs yet.
Iterate over each pair of digits (i, j) in A and B, starting from the most significant digit to the least significant digit. For each pair:
    If the sum of the two digits is less than or equal to 9, there would be no carry for this pair. Update the DP table accordingly.
    If the sum of the two digits is greater than 9, update the DP table with the number of carries in this pair.

To avoid recalculating subproblems, use a memoization approach by storing the results of subproblems as you solve them. The key to the problem would be the pair of digits being considered.
Once all pairs have been processed, calculate the expected number of non-zero carries by summing up the values in the DP table and dividing by the total number of pairs.
