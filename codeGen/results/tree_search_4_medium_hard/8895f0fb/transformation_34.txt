===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about applying memoization to a recursive function that calculates the expected number of non-zero carries.

DP state: (n, m) where n and m are the current digits from A and B respectively. The DP state only needs to store the current digits because the number of non-zero carries depends on the current digits being added.

Memoize the recursive function by storing the results in a dictionary. This is necessary because the recursive function will be called multiple times with the same input, but it's expensive to calculate the expected number of non-zero carries for the same input multiple times.

To improve the plan, consider using dynamic programming instead of memoization if the problem has overlapping subproblems. In this case, there are no overlapping subproblems because each addition operation depends on the current digits being added.

The plan does not include edge cases explicitly, but it should work correctly for all inputs. The base case for the recursion is when n or m becomes 0, which means that either A or B has been fully processed and there will be no more carries.
