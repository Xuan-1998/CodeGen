===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B.

A possible state expression and base case could be:
dp[i][j] = {sum of non-zero carries when adding ith digit of A and jth digit of B} if neither i nor j is equal to N (the maximum number of digits), 
Otherwise, dp[i][j] = 0 (base case: no more digits left)

To improve the plan:
- We can consider a 1D DP table instead of 2D, since we only care about the cumulative sum of non-zero carries.
- Initialize a dictionary to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits.

Implementing memoization by storing the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in a dictionary, using the pair of digits as the key.

To handle edge cases:
- Consider what happens when either A or B has only one digit left (i.e., N = 1). 
- In this case, we can directly calculate the number of non-zero carries and update the DP table accordingly.
