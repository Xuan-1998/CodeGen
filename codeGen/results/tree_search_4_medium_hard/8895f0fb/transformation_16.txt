===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B.

The base case could be when i is equal to N, indicating that we are considering the last digit of either A or B. In this case, there would be no carry since we can only add single-digit numbers together.

Consider using a 1D DP table to store the cumulative sum of non-zero carries for each possible digit value.

Implement tabulation using a 2D DP table with size (N+1) x (10), where dp[i][j] represents the number of non-zero carries when adding the i-th digit of A and the j-th digit of B.

Fill in the base case by setting dp[0][j] to 0 for all j, since there would be no carry when considering the first digit of either A or B.

The recursive formula could be: dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][k''] where k ranges from 0 to i-1 and k'' ranges from 0 to j-1) + (1 if (i-1)'s digit in A plus (j-1)'s digit in B is greater than or equal to 10, else 0).

Implement tabulation by iterating over the DP table and filling it up accordingly.

The final answer would be the average of all dp[N][j] values divided by 10.
