===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B.

The state expression could be a 2D table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of non-zero carries when adding A's i-th digit and B's j-th digit.

To calculate the expected number of non-zero carries, consider using a recursive formula that takes into account the maximum number of digits N as the base case. For smaller values of N, recursively calculate the expected number of carries for each pair of digits in A and B.

Create a 2D DP table with dimensions (N+1) x (N+1) to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B. Initialize the base case by setting dp[N][0] = dp[0][N] = 0, as there are no carries when adding a single digit.

For values of i and j less than N, calculate the expected number of non-zero carries using the recursive formula: dp[i][j] = sum( (dp[k-1][l-1] for k in range(i+1), N) ) / (N-i) where k ranges from 0 to N and l ranges from 0 to N.

Finally, return the value of dp[0][0] as the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B.
