===BEGIN PLAN===
state: dp[i][j] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A with i digits and B with N-i digits.

dp[0][0] = 0 (base case, since there's no carry for a single digit)

for i from 1 to N:
    for j from 0 to i:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + (carry_prob * 10^(N-i-j)) 
        where carry_prob is the probability of a non-zero carry when adding two digits

Create a 2D array dp of size N x N to store the expected number of non-zero carries for each pair of A and B with i digits and j digits respectively.

Calculate the final answer by summing up all values in the dp array and dividing by total possible pairs (N+1) * (N+1)
