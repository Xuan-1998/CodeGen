===BEGIN PLAN===
DP state: (n, carry) where n is the current digit being processed and carry is a boolean indicating if there was a non-zero carry in the previous addition.
Create a 3D array dp[n][10][2] to store the expected number of non-zero carries for each digit n, the current digit value (0-9), and the carry state (true or false).
Base case: When processing the first digit (n = 0), set dp[0][i][c] to 1 if c is true, and 0 otherwise.
Induction step:
    For each pair of digits at position n:
        Iterate over all possible combinations of 0-9 as input for the two digits.
        For each combination:
            Calculate the expected number of non-zero carries by considering all possible values of carry from the previous addition.
            Update dp[n][i][c] with the calculated value, where i is the current digit value and c is the current carry state.
