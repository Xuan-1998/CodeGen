===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B.
The base case could be when i or j is equal to N, indicating that we have processed all the digits in A. In this case, the state would depend on the last digit of A and the current digit of B.
The transition from dp[i-1][j] to dp[i][j] can be made by considering the last carry when adding the ith digit of A and the jth digit of B.
dp[i][j] = (last carry + 1) if i > 0 && j > 0
             0 otherwise

The state for dp[N-1][j] would depend on the last digit of A, so we need to consider all possible digits of B and their corresponding carries.

The transition from dp[i][j-1] to dp[i][j] can be made by considering the last carry when adding the ith digit of A and the jth digit of B.
dp[i][j] = (last carry + 1) if i > 0 && j > 0
             0 otherwise

The state for dp[i][N-1] would depend on the current digit of A, so we need to consider all possible digits of B and their corresponding carries.

Finally, the expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B can be calculated as the average of all possible pairs of A and B.
The average is calculated by summing up the number of non-zero carries for each pair of A and B divided by the total number of pairs.
