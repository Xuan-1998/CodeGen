===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if there's a way to use tabulation with a 1D array to keep track of the cumulative sum of carries.

state: dp[i] = expected number of non-zero carries when adding A and B with i digits in total.
    - Initialize dp[0] = 0
dp[i] = (sum of dp[j] where j < i) + expected number of non-zero carries when adding last digit of A and B

Design a function that calculates the expected number of non-zero carries recursively.

function expected_carries(A, B, N):
    if N == 1:
        return max(A, B) // 10
    else:
        dp = [0] * (N + 1)
        for i in range(2, N + 1):
            dp[i] = sum(dp[j] for j in range(i)) + expected_carries(max(A % 10**i, B % 10**i) - min(A % 10**i, B % 10**i), max(9 * (i - 1), 0), i-1)
        return dp[N]
