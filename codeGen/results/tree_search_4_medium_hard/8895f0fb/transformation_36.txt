===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about applying memoization to a recursive function that calculates the expected number of non-zero carries.

DP state: (n, m) where n and m are the current digits from A and B respectively. 
This is because we don't need to keep track of the actual carry count in each step, as it only depends on the last two digits being added.
The base case for the recursion should be when both n and m become 0.

Implement memoization at the recursive function call level by storing the intermediate results in a dictionary. This way, we can avoid redundant calculations by looking up previously computed values if they are already stored in the memo dictionary.

To calculate the expected number of non-zero carries for two N-digit numbers A and B, iterate over all pairs of digits from A and B (from right to left), calculating the expected number of non-zero carries at each step. 
Finally, divide the total number of non-zero carries by the total number of pairs to get the average.
