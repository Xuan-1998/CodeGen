===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] = cumulative sum of expected number of non-zero carries when adding A with j digits and B with N-j digits.

state transition: dp[i][j] = 0 + (dp[i-1][k=0|1]+(A's digit in i-th position > B's digit in i-th position)) * (number of such pairs)

base case: dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since adding an empty number to any other number won't result in carries.

===END PLAN===
