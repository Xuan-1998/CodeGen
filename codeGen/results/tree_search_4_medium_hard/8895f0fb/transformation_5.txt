===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits in A and B.

The state expression could be a 2D table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of non-zero carries when adding A's i-th digit and B's j-th digit. This allows us to calculate the expected number of non-zero carries when adding all possible pairs of digits in A and B.

Consider using a 1D DP table to store the cumulative sum modulo 10 for each digit position in A and B. The state expression could be a 1D array dp[i] where dp[i] represents the cumulative sum modulo 10 up to the i-th digit position. This helps us calculate the cumulative sum of digits in both A and B, which is used to determine the number of non-zero carries.

To avoid redundant calculations, implement memoization by creating a dictionary where the keys are tuples representing the state (i, j) or (i), and the values are the calculated results. This ensures that we only calculate each pair of digits once and store the result for future reference.

Finally, use this information to calculate the expected number of non-zero carries when adding all possible pairs of N-digit numbers in base 10 representation.
