===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a 2D DP table dp[i][j] where i and j are indices of digits in A and B respectively, to store the number of non-zero carries for each pair of digits. 

Base case: When either i or j is equal to N-1 (i.e., we've reached the last digit of either A or B), there would be no carry since we can only add single-digit numbers together.

Transition rule: For a given pair of digits ai and bj, consider all possible carries when adding ai and bj. If ai + bj >= 10, then there is a non-zero carry for this pair. This can be done by iterating over the range [0, 9] to find the number of carries for each digit.

Memoization: Store the results of subproblems in dp[i][j], where each subproblem is defined by the current digits being added in A and B. 

To calculate the expected number of non-zero carries, iterate over all possible pairs of A and B, add up the number of carries for each pair, and divide by the total number of pairs.

The updated plan includes edge cases (i.e., when i or j is equal to N-1) and handles potential issues with the original plan.
