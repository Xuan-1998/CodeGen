===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i] = last_winner if we're considering i players, and the dynamic programming array stores the winners for each number of players from 1 to X.

state transition:
- if i is not a multiple of M, then dp[i] = i % (X+1)
- otherwise, dp[i] = dp[(i-M) % (X+1)]

base case: 
dp[0] = 0

===END PLAN===
