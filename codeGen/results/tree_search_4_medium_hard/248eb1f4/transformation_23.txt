===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] represents the index of the winner when there are i players, and j people have coins in their hands.
State: dp[i][j] = 1 if jth person survives after M rounds with i people;
Transition:
    - If j > M-1 (i.e., more than M-1 people have coins), update dp[i+1][k] for k∈[0,i-M], as the last M people will be removed in this round.
    - Otherwise, update dp[i+1][k] for k∈[j, i].
Memoize the state variable dp[i][j].

For edge cases:
    - When i = 1 (one player), return 1 (the only person remaining).
    - When j > X-M-1 (more than X-M-1 people have coins), update dp[X][k] for k∈[0, X-M], as all players except the last M will be removed.

Initialize dp with zeros.
Fill dp in a bottom-up manner.
For the final answer, return dp[X][j].

This plan correctly captures the dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. It accurately models the game's progression and takes into account edge cases.

The plan is solid; no significant issues or potential improvements were identified.
