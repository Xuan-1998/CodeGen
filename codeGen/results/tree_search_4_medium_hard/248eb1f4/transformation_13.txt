===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization can be used to avoid redundant computation in this problem.
The state expression dp[i] = last_winner if we're considering i players, 
and the dynamic programming array stores the winners for each number of players from 1 to X.

dp[i] = 1 + dp[i-1] - ((i-1)//M)*M. This choice considers the previous winner and how many times the coin has been passed.

A recursive function can be created that uses the same problem size as its arguments, 
like this: func winner(int i, int M) returns int.

The base case is when i == 1, in which case we just return 1. 
Otherwise, we call winner(i-1, M) and subtract ((i-1)//M)*M to get the previous winner and adjust for the coin being passed.
Finally, we add 1 to get the current winner.

This plan seems correct and should work well for solving this problem. 
It includes edge cases as it handles the base case correctly. 

One possible improvement is to use an iterative approach instead of a recursive one, 
which can be more efficient and avoid stack overflow issues for large values of X.
