===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization is more suitable as the function calls itself recursively in each step, and the value of each step only depends on the previous steps. Memoizing intermediate results would significantly improve performance by avoiding redundant computation.

dp[i][j] represents whether jth person is alive after (M-1) rounds with i players; if not, the next winner index will be (j+1)%i.

Create a dictionary dp to store the intermediate results.
For each test case, iterate from X to 1, and for each number of players i:
    Initialize a variable winner as 0
    Iterate from 0 to i-1, and for each player j:
        Check if j is alive after (M-1) rounds with i players; if not, update winner as (j+1)%i
    Print the winner index
