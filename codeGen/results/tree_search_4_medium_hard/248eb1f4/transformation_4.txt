==BEGIN PLAN==
Memoization is more suitable as the function calls itself recursively in each step, and the value of each step only depends on the previous steps. Memoizing intermediate results would significantly improve performance by avoiding redundant computation.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = winner_index if we're considering i players with j people having coins.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k]) for k in range(j-M+1,j);

Memoize the function using dynamic programming with a recursive approach, where each state is calculated based on the previous states.

To handle edge cases:
- For i=0 or j=0, return 1 as there's only one player.
- Handle cases when M is very large by dividing it into smaller subproblems.
