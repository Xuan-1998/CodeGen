"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given a fixed integer M and X, find the winner for each number of players from 1 to X in a game where N people stand in a circle, and a coin is passed around until only one person remains. The coin is passed M-1 times clockwise before the person holding it is removed from the circle.\\n\\nInput: The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases. Each test case contains two space-separated integers M and X. The input is read from standard input.\\n\\nOutput: For each test case, output X integers A_{1}, A_{2}, ..., A_{X}, where A_{i} is the index of the winner if i people are playing this game.\\n\\nConstraints: 1 \\u2264 T \\u2264 1000, 1 \\u2264 M \\u2264 10^9, 1 \\u2264 X \\u2264 10000, and the sum of X over all test cases is not more than 5 * 10^5.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Number theory', 'Dynamic programming']\", \"difficulties\": \"MEDIUM_HARD\", \"source\": \"codechef\", \"url\": \"https://www.codechef.com/problems/CIRCLEGAME\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"1\\n2 3\\n\", \"output\": \"1 1 1\"}]}"
