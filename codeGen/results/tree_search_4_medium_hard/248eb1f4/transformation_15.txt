Plan:
Memoization is more suitable as the function calls itself recursively in each step, and the value of each step only depends on the previous steps. Memoizing intermediate results would significantly improve performance by avoiding redundant computation.

The state expression is dp[i] = last_winner if we're considering i players, and the dynamic programming array stores the winners for each number of players from 1 to X.

dp[i] = i % (X+1) if i is not a multiple of M, otherwise dp[(i- M) % (X+1)].
Memoizing intermediate results would significantly improve performance by avoiding redundant computation. 

This choice uses the remainder operator to determine the next winner. 
The plan does include edge cases and correctly handles them.
