===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization is more suitable as the function calls itself recursively in each step, and the value of each step only depends on the previous steps. Memoizing intermediate results would significantly improve performance by avoiding redundant computation.

The state expression is dp[i] = last_winner if we're considering i players, and the dynamic programming array stores the winners for each number of players from 1 to X.

dp[i] = (i-1) % X + 1 if i is not a multiple of M, otherwise dp[(i-M) % (X+1)]. This choice assumes that the winner does not depend on whether it's M people or not.

The function can be implemented using dynamic programming with memoization. The state expression is dp[i] = last_winner if we're considering i players, and the dynamic programming array stores the winners for each number of players from 1 to X.
