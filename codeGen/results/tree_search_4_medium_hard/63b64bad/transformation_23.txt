===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y), where x is the current index in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated.

To ensure termination, you need to track whether the program has terminated. You can do this by keeping a flag indicating whether the program has stopped or not.

Implement a bottom-up approach, starting from the initial state (x=1, y=0) and recursively calculating the final value for each subsequent state (x=x+a_x, y=y+a_x).

To avoid infinite loops, you need to ensure that x does not exceed n. If x exceeds n, you can set the flag indicating termination.
