===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each subproblem (sequence length) has overlapping subproblems, so we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.
The state expression is y and the base case is when x = n (program terminates).
State: (x, y); Transition: 
    if (x <= 0 or x > n):
        terminate
    else:
        (x', y') = ((x+a[x]) % n, y+a[x]), 
        y'=y+a[x], 
        x'=x+a[x], 
        then update state with (x', y')
Maintain two arrays, dp and prev, to keep track of the previous states and the corresponding values.
dp[i] is the final value of y when the program terminates for sequence length i
prev[i][j] is the previous state ((x, y)) before the transition that led to state (i, j)
For each i from 2 to n:
    Initialize dp[i] = -1 and prev[i][0] = (1, 0) (program starts with x=1 and y=0)
    For each j from 1 to a[i]:
        Transition: 
            if (x <= 0 or x > i):
                terminate
            else:
                (x', y') = ((x+a[x]) % i, y+a[x]), 
                y'=y+a[x], 
                x'=x+a[x]
                Update dp[i] and prev[i][j] accordingly
    Print dp[n-1]
