===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y), where x is the current index in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated.
Consider a state as the pair (x, y) where x is the current index in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated.

Apply memoization by storing intermediate results and using them to avoid recalculating the same sub-problems multiple times. The state transition function would take the current state (x, y) as input and return a new state or -1 if the program terminates.

To improve the plan, you could also consider adding a check for when x <= 0 or x > n, which would allow you to terminate the program early if it's not possible for the program to run further. This would help avoid unnecessary calculations and reduce the time complexity of your solution.

The plan does include edge cases such as when the program terminates immediately (x <= 0 or x > n) and also handles the case where the program never terminates.
