===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each subproblem (sequence length) has overlapping subproblems, so we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.
The state expression is a combination of x, y, cumulative_sum, and current_value, where cumulative_sum is the sum of all elements in the sequence so far, and current_value is the value at the current position.
state: (x, y, cumulative_sum, current_value), where the base case is when the sequence becomes repetitive (i.e., x = 0 or x > n).
Use a 3D table to store the states for each subproblem: dp[i][j][k] represents the final value of y after i steps and j iterations.
Initialize the table with -1, since we don't know yet whether the sequence terminates.
For each state, calculate the next state by updating x, y, and cumulative_sum according to the given operations on the sequence.
When x â‰¤ 0 or x > n, set the final value of y as the current value.
Finally, return the values in the table.
