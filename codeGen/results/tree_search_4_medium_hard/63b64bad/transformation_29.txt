===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y), where x is the current index in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated.

The transition relationships can be formulated based on the operations performed on the sequence:

1.  If a_{x} > n, then the program terminates with y as the current value.
2.  If x ≤ 0 or x > n, then the program immediately terminates.
3.  Otherwise, increment both x and y by a_{x}, simultaneously.

To implement memoization, define a recursive function that takes (x, y) as input and returns the final value of y after the program has terminated. Use this function to calculate the final value of y for each state, returning the cached result if the same subproblem has been solved before.

In the memoized function:

1.  Check if x ≤ 0 or x > n; if so, return -1 as the program does not terminate.
2.  If a_{x} is greater than n, calculate y' by incrementing y by a_{x} and decrementing x by a_{x}; then recursively call the function with (x', y') as input and return the result.
3.  Otherwise, recursively call the function with (x + a_{x}, y + a_{x}) as input; if the result is -1, return -1; otherwise, return the cached value.

Finally, iterate over each sequence element a_2 to a_n, calculate the final value of y for each run of the program on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}, and print the requested values.
