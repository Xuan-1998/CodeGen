===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

Let's define a state as (x, y) where x is the current value of x and y is the current value of y. A transition occurs when you increase both x and y by a_{x}, or increase y by a_{x} while decreasing x by a_{x}. 

The base case occurs when x ≤ 0 or x > n, in which case the program terminates.

View each step as a transition from one state to another, and define states based on whether the program terminates or not. 

Use dynamic programming with a 2D table, where dp[i][j] is the final value of y when y = j and the program starts at x = i. 

Initialize dp[0][y] for all y as -1 (since the program does not terminate initially).

For each state (x, y), calculate the next states that can be reached from it based on the rules of the program. If a_{x} > x, there are two possible transitions: increase both x and y by a_{x}, or increase y by a_{x} while decreasing x by a_{x}. 

If a_{x} ≤ x, there is only one possible transition: decrease x by a_{x}.

Iteratively update the values in the dp table based on these transitions. When you encounter a state that has already been calculated (i.e., the program terminates), store this value as the final answer for the initial state (n, 0).

Finally, return the stored value as the final answer for each run of the program.
