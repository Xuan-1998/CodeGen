===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y), where x is the current index in the sequence, y is the final value of y after the program has terminated.

Use a dictionary to store calculated values and check if a state has been computed before before calculating it.

For each iteration i:

    Initialize x = 1, y = 0
    While x <= n:
        Calculate new_x = x + a_x
        Calculate new_y = y + a_x - (x % a_x)
        If new_x > n or new_x < 1: 
            Terminate the program and return -1
        Update x, y with the calculated values
    Return y

This plan is correct. It takes into account the edge cases where the program may not terminate.
