===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y), where x represents the remaining values in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated.
The state can be represented by a pair (x, y) where x is the remaining values in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated. The transitions are based on the operations performed by the program: increasing both x and y by a_{x}, then decreasing x by a_{x} while keeping y equal to itself.

Implementing a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary to store previously computed values and avoid redundant calculations.
