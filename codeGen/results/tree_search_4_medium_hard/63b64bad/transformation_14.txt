===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each subproblem (sequence length) has overlapping subproblems, so we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.

state: (x, y, prev_a), where prev_a is the last element in the sequence

Design a recursive function with memoization by passing the current state as an argument:

dp((x, y, prev_a)) = 
    if x <= 0 or x > n:
        return -1
    elif prev_a == a_{n}:
        # sequence becomes repetitive
        return dp((1, 0, a_{n}))
    else:
        new_x = x + prev_a
        new_y = y + prev_a
        if new_x <= 0 or new_x > n:
            return -1
        return dp((new_x, new_y, prev_a))

The base case is when the sequence becomes repetitive.

Store and update memoization table accordingly:

memo = {}

Initialize the recursive function with initial state (1, 0, a_{2}):
return dp((1, 0, a_{2}))
