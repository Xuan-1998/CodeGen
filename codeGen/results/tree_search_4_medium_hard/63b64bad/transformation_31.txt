===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

The base case occurs when x ≤ 0 or x > n, indicating that the program has terminated.

In each step, consider the current state (x, y) as a node in a graph. Nodes with x ≤ 0 or x > n are terminal nodes representing termination.

Edges represent transitions from one state to another based on the sequence values. You could model each state as a tuple (x, y) and use a memoization dictionary to store the values for previously computed states, avoiding redundant calculations by checking if the state has been visited before.

To further optimize the plan, you could sort the sequence in descending order, processing the nodes in topological order based on their value. This would reduce the number of iterations needed for the memoized calculations.

The updated plan also includes edge cases: when x ≤ 0 or x > n, the program terminates; when y reaches a certain threshold (e.g., n^2), you can terminate early and return -1 as the final value.
