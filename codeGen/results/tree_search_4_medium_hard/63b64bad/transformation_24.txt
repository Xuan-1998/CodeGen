===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y), where x is the current index in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated.
A state could be represented by the tuple (x, y, terminated), where terminated indicates whether the program has terminated or not.

Memoize a function that calculates the final value of y for a given state (x, y, terminated).

Let's break down the transition rules:

* If x â‰¤ 0 or x > n, the program terminates.
* Otherwise, increase both x and y by a_{x}.
* Increase y by a_{x} while decreasing x by a_{x}.

Memoize this function recursively, using the fact that the final value of y depends only on the current state (x, y, terminated) and not on any previous states. This will avoid recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.

The base case is when the program terminates; in this case, return the current value of y as the answer.
