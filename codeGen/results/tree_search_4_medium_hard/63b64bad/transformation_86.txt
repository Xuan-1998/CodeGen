===BEGIN PLAN===
The sequence values are used in the transitions, so we should focus on identifying the relationships between the state space (sequence length) and the transition rules.

The state is just y, as we only care about the final value of y. Think about how y evolves based on a_x and previous values of x, considering the termination conditions x â‰¤ 0 or x > n.

Design a recursive function that takes the current state y as input, and uses the sequence values a_x to compute the next state, while maintaining the termination conditions:

* If x <= 0 or x > n, terminate
* Increase both x and y by a_x
* Increase y by a_x while decreasing x by a_x

This recursive function can be implemented using dynamic programming. Initialize an array dp of size n+1, where dp[i] represents the final value of y after running the program on the sequence up to index i.

The base case is when x > n or x <= 0; in this case, return -1 (program terminates).

The recursive case is when x is within bounds. Compute the next state y' by increasing both x and y by a_x, then increase y' by a_x while decreasing x' by a_x. This new value of y' will be the final value after running the program on the sequence up to index i+1.

The main function iterates over the sequence, updating dp[i] with the result from the recursive function. Finally, return dp[n-1], which represents the final value of y after running the program on the entire sequence.
