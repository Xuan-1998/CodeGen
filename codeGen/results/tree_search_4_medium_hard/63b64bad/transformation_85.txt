===BEGIN PLAN===
The state is indeed y, and we should focus on identifying how it evolves based on a_x and previous values of x.

1. Define a table dp where dp[i][y] represents the final value of y after running the program on the sequence up to index i with initial value y.
2. Initialize the table with -1 for all entries, as we don't know yet if the program will terminate or not.
3. Iterate over each index i from 2 to n:
    a. For each y in range(0, i), calculate the next value of y based on a_x and previous values of x.
    b. Update dp[i][y] with the calculated new value.
4. Once the table is filled, iterate over each entry dp[n-1][y] and print the final value of y that corresponds to the program terminating.
