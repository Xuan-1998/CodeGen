===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y), where x is the current index in the sequence, y is the final value of y after the program has terminated.

Transition function: 

1. If x <= 0 or x > n, return (-1, -1) as the program terminates.
2. Calculate new values for x and y according to the rules of the problem:
   - Increase both x and y by a_{x}.
   - Decrease x by a_{x} and increase y by a_{x}.
3. Return (x, y) as the next state.

Use memoization to store all intermediate states and their corresponding final values of y. This way, you can avoid recalculating the same states multiple times.

Edge cases: 
- What if x is 0 or n? Should we include these states in our transition function?
- What if y becomes negative? Should we consider it as termination?
