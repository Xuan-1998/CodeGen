===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

The base case occurs when x ≤ 0 or x > n, or when the program reaches a point where it does not terminate. This is equivalent to saying that if x becomes invalid (out of bounds), the program terminates.

Consider the pair (x, y) as the current state, where x is the current index in the sequence and y is the value of the variable after the last operation.

Create a lookup table dp[i] to store the values of y for different values of i. The key insight here is that once you know how much y will be at each step up to i, then you can easily calculate how much it will be at step i+1.

So, initialize dp[0] = 0 (or -1, depending on your termination condition). Then for each state (i, y), update the value of dp[i+1] as follows:

- If x = n, terminate.
- If x ≤ 0 or x > n, terminate.
- Increase both x and y by a_value equal to a[x]. This is equivalent to saying that when you reach a new index in the sequence, you should calculate how much y would be if you had reached this index before, then update the current value of x.

Then fill up dp array. Finally, return dp[n-1].

This plan does include edge cases and termination conditions.
