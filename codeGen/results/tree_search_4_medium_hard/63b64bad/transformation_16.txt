===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each subproblem (sequence length) has overlapping subproblems, so we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.

Let's define our state expression as (x, y, cycle_length), where cycle_length is the length of the current repetitive pattern.

The base case is when the sequence becomes repetitive. In this case, the final value of y will be the same for all subsequent sequences with the same pattern.

Memoizing the function calls by storing the computed values in a dictionary can help us avoid redundant computations and make the solution more efficient.

To solve this problem, we'll maintain a dictionary dp to store the intermediate results. For each sequence length n, we'll compute the final value of y for that length and store it in dp[n].

Here's an example of how we can implement this plan:
