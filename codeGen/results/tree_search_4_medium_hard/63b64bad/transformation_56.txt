===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y), where x represents the remaining values in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated.
The state can be represented by a pair (x, y) where x is the remaining values in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated. The transitions are based on the operations performed by the program: increasing both x and y by a_{x}, then decreasing x by a_{x} while keeping y equal to itself.

Creating a 2D array dp[][] where each cell dp[i][j] stores the maximum value of y for a given state (i, j), with i representing the remaining values in the sequence and j being the final value of y after the program has terminated. Then, iteratively fill up the table by considering all possible transitions from the current state.

To determine whether the program terminates or not, we can use the following rule: if x â‰¤ 0 or x > n, the program immediately terminates. So, we only need to consider states where 0 < x <= n.

In the end, for each run of the program on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}, output the value stored in dp[n][i-1] as the final value of y when the program terminates. If the program does not terminate, output -1.
