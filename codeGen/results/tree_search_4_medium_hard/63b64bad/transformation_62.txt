===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y), where x represents the remaining values in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated.

A state can be defined as the maximum value reached so far for x, along with the corresponding final value of y. The transitions would be based on updating this maximum value and the final value of y.

Define a function that takes as input the current state (x, y) and returns the next state (x', y') based on the transition rules, then use memoization to cache the results.

To improve the plan, you could consider using a priority queue to manage the states in the graph, allowing you to focus on the most promising states first. This would help to reduce the overall computational complexity of the algorithm.

The plan does not include edge cases explicitly, but it can be adapted to handle these cases by adding additional checks and transitions for the initial state (x=1, y=0) and any terminal states that might arise during the simulation.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
