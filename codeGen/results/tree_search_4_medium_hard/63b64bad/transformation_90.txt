===BEGIN PLAN===
The sequence values are used in the transitions, so we should focus on identifying the relationships between the state space (sequence length) and the transition rules.

Define the state as whether the program has terminated or not. The state is the current x and y values, and the transition occurs when we update them according to the given operations.

Using a 2D table with dimensions (n+1) x (10^9+1) to store the state values where the rows represent the sequence length and columns represent the y values.
Initialize the table with -1 for all states, assuming the program will not terminate initially.
For each sequence length i from 2 to n:
    For each possible y value j from 0 to 10^9:
        If x = 1 and y = 0:
            Update x and y according to the given operations a_x and store the new state in the table.
            Continue updating the table until the program terminates or reaches x > n.
        If the program has terminated, break the loop and move on to the next sequence length.
    Print the value stored at the state (n-1, 0) as the final y value for the given sequence.
