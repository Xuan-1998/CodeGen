===BEGIN PLAN===
The sequence values are used in the transitions, so we should focus on identifying the relationships between the state space (sequence length) and the transition rules.

The state is a tuple (x, y), where x is the current position in the sequence and y is the value of y at that position. We can represent this as a 2D DP table with dimensions (n+1, 2), where n is the length of the sequence.

We start by initializing the DP table with base cases:
- For all i <= 0 or i > n, we set dp[i][x] = -1 for both x.
- For the initial state (1, 0), we set dp[1][0] = 0 and dp[1][1] = 0.

Now, for each step in the sequence:
- If x <= 0 or x > n, we terminate and set dp[i][x] = -1.
- Otherwise, we calculate the new state (x', y') based on the transition rules: x' = x + a_x, y' = y + a_x.
- We update the DP table with the new state: dp[i+1][0] = max(dp[i][0], dp[i][1]), dp[i+1][1] = dp[i][0].

Finally, we return the value in the last row and column of the DP table, which represents the final value of y.
