===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y), where x is the current index in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated. A state could be represented by the tuple (x, y, terminated), where terminated indicates whether the program has terminated or not.

Create a dictionary to store the results of subproblems, and use it to avoid redundant calculations.

For each step in the simulation:
    - Calculate the next state based on the current state and the sequence value
    - Check if the program has terminated (x <= 0 or x > n)
    - If not terminated, recursively calculate the result for the new state
    - Store the result in the dictionary

To improve this plan:
- Use a memoization function to store and retrieve results from the dictionary
- Consider using a priority queue instead of recursion to avoid excessive memory usage
- Edge cases: Ensure that the initial state (1, 0) is included in the simulation, and handle cases where x <= 0 or x > n
