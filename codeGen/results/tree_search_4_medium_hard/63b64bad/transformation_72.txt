===BEGIN PLAN===
The sequence values are used in the transitions, so we should focus on identifying the relationships between the state space (sequence length) and the transition rules.

The state is a tuple (x, y), where x is the current position in the sequence and y is the value of y at that position.
Choose the initial state as (1, 0) and consider transitions based on the sequence values a_x for each step.

Use a dictionary to store intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations. Initialize an empty dictionary dp.

For each sequence value a_x:
    Update x by subtracting a_x from it
    Update y by adding a_x to it
    Store the updated state (x, y) in dp if x is within bounds

Check for termination conditions: If x is less than or equal to 0 or greater than n, terminate the program and return the current value of y.

Repeat steps 2-4 until termination.
