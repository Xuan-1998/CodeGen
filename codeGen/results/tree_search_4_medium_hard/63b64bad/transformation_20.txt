===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each subproblem (sequence length) has overlapping subproblems, so we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.

The state expression is (x, y), where x and y are the current values of x and y in the sequence. The base case is when the program terminates or when the sequence becomes repetitive.

state: (x, y)

Implement a recursive function with a dynamic programming memoization technique

dp[i][x][y] = min(dp[i-1][k][j]+a[k] for k=1 to i if k>x and j=y+a[k])

if dp[-1][-1][-1]
return -1
else return y
