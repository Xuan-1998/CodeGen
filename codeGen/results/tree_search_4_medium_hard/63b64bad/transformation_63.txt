===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

The base case occurs when there are no more values left in the sequence, i.e., x = 0. In this state, y will be the final value.
A dynamic programming approach can be applied by defining a state as (x, y) and transitioning to new states based on the values of x and y; using memoization to store intermediate results.

Use bottom-up memoization with iterative function calls instead of recursive function calls. This is because the problem involves arrays and could cause stack overflow for large inputs if recursive approach is used.
Start from base case (x = 0) and build up states gradually, avoiding repeated calculations by storing them in a table.

Define a function that takes x and y as input, calculates the next state based on the sequence values, and returns the final value of y when x reaches 0.
Use this function to fill a table with the results for all possible states (x, y), and finally return the result for the initial state (1, 0).
