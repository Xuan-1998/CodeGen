===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y), where x is the current index in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated.

Consider a state as the pair (x, y) where x is the current index in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated. Use dynamic programming to store the states of the graph and their corresponding values.

Create a 2D array dp[n][n] where n is the length of the sequence, with initial values all set to -1 (to indicate that the state has not been computed yet). Initialize a variable y_max as 0 to keep track of the maximum final value of y found so far. For each i from 2 to n, compute the dp[i][i-1] and dp[i][i] states using the recurrence relation: 

dp[x][y] = min(dp[x+ai][x+y+ai] + ai for all i where x ≤ 0 or x > n)

For each state (x, y) in dp, if x ≤ 0 or x > n, set y_max to the maximum of y_max and y. 

Finally, return y_max as the result.
