===BEGIN PLAN===
The sequence values are used in the transitions, so we should focus on identifying the relationships between the state space (sequence length) and the transition rules.

The state is a pair (x, y), where x is the current position in the sequence and y is the value of y at that position.

Consider the sequence values as a function that takes a state (x, y) and returns the next state, using rules for increasing/decreasing x and y simultaneously.

Use dynamic programming with a 2D table to store states and their values, then fill the table from bottom up. Initialize the first column of the table with (1, 0), which is the initial state.

For each cell in the table, calculate the next state by applying the transition rules: if x <= 0 or x > n, terminate; else increase both x and y by a_{x}, then decrease x by a_{x} and increment y by a_{x}.

Finally, read the output as the value of y when x reaches the end of the sequence. If x never reaches the end of the sequence (i.e., the program does not terminate), output -1.
