===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

The base case occurs when x ≤ 0 or x > n, indicating that the program has terminated.

In each step, consider the current state (x, y) as a node in a graph. Nodes with x ≤ 0 or x > n are terminal nodes representing termination. Edges represent transitions from one state to another based on the sequence values.

Use memoization to store and reuse calculations for states that have already been visited.

Implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table with dimensions (n+1) x (10^9 + 1), where the table cell at row i and column j represents whether the program terminates after processing the first i elements of the sequence, given that x is initially set to j.

For each step, update the table cells based on the previous state transitions. If a terminal state is reached, mark it as terminated in the table.

Finally, iterate through the table to find the final value of y for each run of the program and return the desired output.
