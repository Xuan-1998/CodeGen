===BEGIN PLAN===
The sequence values are used in the transitions, so we should focus on identifying the relationships between the state space (sequence length) and the transition rules.

The state is just y, as we only care about the final value of y.

Think about how y evolves based on a_x and previous values of x, considering the termination conditions x â‰¤ 0 or x > n.

Create a dictionary to store intermediate results for memoization

Let's define a function dp(a) that returns the final value of y for a given sequence a. The function can take advantage of the recurrence relation: if a_x = x, then y will remain unchanged; if a_x is less than x, then y will increase by a_x and x will decrease by a_x; otherwise, y will increase by 1 and x will increase by 1.

We can use this function to construct an array dp[0..n-1] where dp[i] = dp(a_2, ..., a_i) is the final value of y for the sequence from a_2 to a_i. The base case dp[0] should be set to 0 since there are no operations when x = 0.

Finally, we can return the last element of the array as the answer.
