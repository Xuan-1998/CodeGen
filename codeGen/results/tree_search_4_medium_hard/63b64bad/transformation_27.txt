===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y), where x is the current index in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated.

The transition relationships can be formulated based on the operations performed on the sequence:

    - Increase both x and y by a_{x}
    - Decrease x by a_{x} while increasing y by a_{x}

Create a dictionary to store previously computed values and use it to avoid recalculating the same subproblems.

Define a recursive function to compute the final value of y for each state:

    - If x > n or x â‰¤ 0, return -1 (program terminated)
    - Increase both x and y by a_{x}
    - Call the recursive function with new values of x and y
    - Decrease x by a_{x} while increasing y by a_{x}
    - Call the recursive function with new values of x and y

Use memoization to store previously computed values in a dictionary, and return the stored value if the state has been visited before.
