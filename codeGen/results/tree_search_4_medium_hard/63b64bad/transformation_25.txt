===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use dynamic programming to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y), where x is the current index in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated. A state could be represented by the tuple (x, y, terminated), where terminated indicates whether the program has terminated or not.

To avoid calculating the same subproblem multiple times, you can use memoization to store the results of subproblems as you solve them. This would allow you to efficiently look up and reuse previously computed values, rather than recomputing them each time.

Use dynamic programming to build up a table of values for all possible states in the graph. Start by initializing the table with default or base cases (e.g., when x is 0 or less), then recursively fill in the rest of the table using the transition rules defined in the problem.
