===BEGIN PLAN===
The sequence values are used in the transitions, so we should focus on identifying the relationships between the state space (sequence length) and the transition rules.

The state is a pair (x, y), where x is the current position in the sequence and y is the value of y at that position.

Choose the initial state as (1, 0) and consider transitions based on the sequence values a_x for each step.
Apply memoization by storing the results of sub-problems in a cache and reusing them when needed

1. Initialize the dynamic programming table dp with shape (n+1, n+1), where n is the length of the sequence. Fill the base case: dp[0][0] = 0.

2. For each position x from 1 to n:
    - For each value y from 0 to a_x:
        - If x > n or x <= 0, set dp[x][y] = -1.
        - Otherwise, update the state by increasing both x and y by a_x, then decrease x by a_x while increasing y by a_x. 
          Set dp[x][y] = this updated state.

3. The final value of y is stored at dp[n][0].
