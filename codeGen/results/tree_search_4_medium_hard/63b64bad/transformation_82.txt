===BEGIN PLAN===
The sequence values are used in the transitions, so we should focus on identifying the relationships between the state space (sequence length) and the transition rules.

The state is just y, as we only care about the final value of y.

Consider the current state y and the next sequence element a_x to be the key for transitions.

Create a 2D array dp with dimensions (n+1) x (10^9 + 1) where dp[y][a_x] stores the final value of y for the given sequence up to index x, then use dynamic programming to fill the dp table.

For each sequence element a_x, update dp[y][a_x] based on whether we increase or decrease y. If we increase y, consider updating dp[y+a_x][a_x] and so on until we find a termination condition (x â‰¤ 0 or x > n).

Fill in the base case for dp[0][a_]. This will be used as the starting point for all other transitions.

Finally, return dp[n-1][a_{n-1}] which corresponds to the final value of y.
