===BEGIN PLAN===
The sequence values are used in the transitions, so we should focus on identifying the relationships between the state space (sequence length) and the transition rules.

The state is just y, as we only care about the final value of y.
Consider the current state y and the next sequence element a_x to be the key for transitions.
Use a hashmap to store the transition values as a function of (y, a_x) and update y accordingly.

Initialize an empty hashmap dp.
For each possible value of y from 0 to n-1:
    For each possible value of x from 2 to n:
        Calculate a_x. If x > n, break the loop.
        Update dp[(y, a_x)] = y + a_x if x == 1; otherwise, update dp[(y, a_x)] = dp[(y+a_x-a_{x+1}, a_{x+1})].
    For each possible value of i from 2 to n:
        Calculate the transition value t = dp[(i-1, a_i)]. If t â‰¤ 0 or t > n, return -1.
        Update y = y + a_i. If x == 1, return y; otherwise, update x = x + a_i and y = y + a_i.
Return y.
