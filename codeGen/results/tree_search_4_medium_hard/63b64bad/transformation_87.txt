===BEGIN PLAN===
The sequence values are used in the transitions, so we should focus on identifying the relationships between the state space (sequence length) and the transition rules.

The state is just y, as we only care about the final value of y.
For each sequence element a_i, we need to calculate the maximum y that can be reached when the program terminates.
Use dynamic programming to keep track of intermediate results for different initial states y and sequence elements a_2 through a_n.
Let dp[y] be the maximum y that can be reached after processing all sequence elements up to i-1, starting from an initial state y.
The recurrence relation is:
    - If y + a_i > n or y < 0, terminate the program, and set dp[y] = y
    - Otherwise, update dp[y+a_i] = max(dp[y+a_i], y+a_i)
Use a 1D array to store the final value of y for each possible state y.
Initialize the array with -1, indicating that the program does not terminate yet.
For each sequence element a_i, update dp[y+a_i] as above and mark the corresponding state y+a_i as terminated.
Finally, return the maximum value in the array, which is the final value of y when the program terminates.
