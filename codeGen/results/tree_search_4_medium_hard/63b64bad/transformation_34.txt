===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

The base case occurs when x ≤ 0 or x > n, indicating that the program has terminated.

In each step, consider the current state (x, y) as a node in a graph. Nodes with x ≤ 0 or x > n are terminal nodes representing termination. Edges represent transitions from one state to another based on the sequence values.

Use dynamic programming to build up solutions for smaller subproblems and use them to solve larger problems.

Dynamically construct a graph using a dictionary where keys are states and values are lists of adjacent nodes representing transitions based on sequence values.

Then, use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

For each node in the graph, calculate the maximum value of y that can be reached from that node. This is done by considering all possible transitions from the current state (x, y) and selecting the one that leads to the highest y value.

Finally, iterate over the nodes in the graph, starting from the initial state (1, 0), until a node with x ≤ 0 or x > n is reached. The maximum y value at this node represents the final value of y for the given sequence.
