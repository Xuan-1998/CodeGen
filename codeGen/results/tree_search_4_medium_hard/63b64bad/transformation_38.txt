===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y), where x is the current index in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated.

Create a dictionary to store the intermediate results and use it to avoid redundant calculations. 

Initialize the dictionary with base cases for states where the program immediately terminates or where x â‰¤ 0 or x > n.

For each state (x, y), calculate the next state by simulating one step of the program: 
    Increase both x and y by a_{x} simultaneously.
    Then, increase y by a_{x} while decreasing x by a_{x}.
Repeat this process until the program terminates or until it reaches a state that has already been calculated.

If the program does not terminate, return -1. Otherwise, return the final value of y.
