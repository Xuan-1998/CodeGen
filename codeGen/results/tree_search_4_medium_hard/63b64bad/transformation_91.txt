===BEGIN PLAN===
The sequence values are used in the transitions, so we should focus on identifying the relationships between the state space (sequence length) and the transition rules.

Define the state as whether the program has terminated or not. The state is a tuple containing the current x and y values.

The transition occurs when we update them according to the given operations. We can create a function that takes the current state and returns the next state after applying the operations.

We will use memoization using a dictionary where keys are the current state and values are the next state. This way, we avoid recalculating the same states multiple times.

The base case for termination is when x ≤ 0 or x > n. We can add this condition to our transition function.

We will iterate through each sequence value from a_2 to a_n and apply the transitions until the program terminates or reaches the maximum allowed length n.

We can use a separate dictionary to store the final y values for each run of the program on the sequence.

The overall plan is:

1. Define the state as (x, y) and create a function that applies the operations to update x and y.
2. Use memoization with a dictionary to store the next states for each state.
3. Create a base case for termination: if x ≤ 0 or x > n, terminate the program.
4. Iterate through each sequence value from a_2 to a_n and apply the transitions until the program terminates or reaches the maximum allowed length n.
5. Store the final y values for each run of the program on the sequence in a separate dictionary.
