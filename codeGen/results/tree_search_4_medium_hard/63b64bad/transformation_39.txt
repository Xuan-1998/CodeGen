To solve this problem, we can model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y, i), where x is the current index in the sequence, y is the final value of y after the program has terminated, and i is the iteration number.
State: (i, y), where i is the iteration number and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated. The transition occurs when the program iterates to the next step.

We can use a dictionary to store calculated values and avoid redundant calculations.

Here's how we can do it:
