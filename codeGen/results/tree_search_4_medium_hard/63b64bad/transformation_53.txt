===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

The base case occurs when x â‰¤ 0 or x > n, or when the program reaches a point where it does not terminate. 

Consider implementing a recursive function that uses memoization to keep track of previously calculated values and prevent repeated calculations. The function should take the current state (x, y) as input, calculate the next states based on the sequence, and check for termination conditions.

To avoid infinite recursion, you could also implement a maximum depth limit for the recursion, ensuring that the function does not exceed this limit before returning -1 if the program does not terminate.

Some possible edge cases to consider are:
- What happens when x or y exceeds the maximum value of integers?
- Are there any specific sequence properties that affect the termination of the program?

By modeling the problem as a graph and using memoization, you can efficiently calculate the final value of y for each run of the program on the sequence.

The plan should be expanded to include these details and edge cases.
