===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y), where x represents the remaining values in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated.
The state can be represented by the current value x in the sequence, and the transition is determined by the operation of increasing both x and y by a_{x}.

Store the state space using a dictionary and implement memoization. 

For each node in the graph, calculate the next nodes reachable from that node by performing the program steps.
Use this to build a dynamic programming table where each cell represents the maximum final value of y for a given sequence up to that point.

Start with an initial state (n-1, 0) and then traverse the graph until you reach a terminal state (x <= 0 or x > n).

The final answer is stored in the last reachable node.
