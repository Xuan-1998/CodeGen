===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each subproblem (sequence length) has overlapping subproblems, so we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.

The state expression is y and the base case is when x = n (program terminates).

State: (x, y);
Transition: 
 1. Calculate x' as (x+a[x]) % n
 2. Update y as y+a[x]
 3. Update x' as x+ a[x]
 4. Update state with (x', y')

Apply memoization by storing the intermediate results in a dictionary where the key is the current state (x, y) and the value is the result for that state.

For each subproblem, check if the state has been computed before (i.e., it's stored in the memoization dictionary). If so, return the stored result. Otherwise, compute the new state using the transition function and store the result in the dictionary before returning it.

The final answer is the value of y when x reaches n.
