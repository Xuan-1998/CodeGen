===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each subproblem (sequence length) has overlapping subproblems, so we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.

The state expression is a combination of x, y, and some intermediate value. The base case is when the sequence becomes repetitive.

state: (x, y, cycle_length), where cycle_length is the length of the current repetitive pattern

Using a 3D table to store the state values and iteratively fill it up from bottom to top:

* Initialize dp[0][1][cycle_length] = (1, 0, cycle_length) as the base case
* For each sequence length i from n-1 down to 2:
    * For each x in range(1, i+1):
        * For each y in range(0, a_x+a_x):
            * Calculate the next state: (x+a_x, y+a_x, cycle_length)
            * Store this state in dp[i][x][y]
* To find the final value of y for each run, simply iterate through the table and return the maximum y
