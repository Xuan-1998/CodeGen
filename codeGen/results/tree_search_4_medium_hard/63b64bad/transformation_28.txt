===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y), where x is the current index in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated.

The transition relationships can be formulated based on the operations performed on the sequence:
- Increase both x and y by a value equal to a_{x} simultaneously.
- Increase y by a_{x} while decreasing x by a_{x}.

Use a 2D array or list of lists to store the intermediate results, where each inner list represents a state (x, y) and the value at each position is the final value of y after the program has terminated for that state.
Initialize the array with a base case: when x â‰¤ 0 or x > n, the final value of y is -1.
