===BEGIN PLAN===
The sequence values are used in the transitions, so we should focus on identifying the relationships between the state space (sequence length) and the transition rules.

The state is a pair (x, y), where x is the current position in the sequence and y is the value of y at that position.

Define states as tuples of (x, y) and transitions based on whether x <= 0 or x > n, considering sequence values and updating both x and y accordingly.

The dynamic programming approach can be applied by creating a table to store the final value of y for each state (x, y) in the sequence. 

Let's create a 2D array dp[n+1][n+1] where dp[i][j] represents the final value of y when the program reaches position i with x = j.

Then, iterate over the sequence and update the table accordingly:

* If x <= 0 or x > n, terminate the program and return -1.
* Otherwise, update dp[x][y] to be the maximum of its current value and y + a[x].
* Update x and y as (x+a[x]), (y+a[x]).
Repeat this process until the program terminates.

The final answer will be stored in dp[n][0].
