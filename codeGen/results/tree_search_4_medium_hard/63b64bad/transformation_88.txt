===BEGIN PLAN===
The sequence values are used in the transitions, so we should focus on identifying the relationships between the state space (sequence length) and the transition rules.

The state is just y, as we only care about the final value of y.

We can create a dictionary to store the results of intermediate computations, with keys being the initial state y and values being the corresponding final value of y. We will iterate over all possible initial states y (from 0 to n) for each sequence element a_2 through a_n.

For each sequence element a_i, we simulate the program until it terminates or reaches the maximum length n. For each step, we update the state y according to the transition rules and store the result in our dictionary.

At the end of this process, we can look up the final value of y for any given initial state y in our dictionary.
