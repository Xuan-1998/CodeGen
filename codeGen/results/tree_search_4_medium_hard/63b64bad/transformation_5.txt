===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming is indeed suitable for this problem due to the overlapping subproblems. 
The state expression (x, y) correctly captures the current position in the sequence and the value of the variable at that step.
The transition function ((x + a[x], y + a[x]), (x - a[x], y + a[x])) accurately describes the next state based on the current state.
Designing a recursive function with memoization is a great approach to avoid redundant calculations. 
However, we should also consider the base case when x â‰¤ 0 or x > n (program terminates) and handle it correctly in our dynamic programming solution.

The plan looks good overall, but let's improve it by adding more details about how to design the recursive function with memoization and handling edge cases:
