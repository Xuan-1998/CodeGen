===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming approach with memoization
state: (x, y, cumulative_sum), where cumulative_sum is the sum of all elements in the sequence so far
base case: when the sequence becomes repetitive, meaning x > n or x <= 0
Use a dictionary-based approach to store intermediate results and avoid redundant computations

Initially:
    x = 1
    y = 0
    cumulative_sum = 0

Iterative process:
    while x <= n and x > 0:
        update x and y based on the sequence value at position x
        increment cumulative_sum by the current sequence value
        store the new state (x, y, cumulative_sum) in the dictionary

When the program terminates or reaches a base case, return the final value of y
