===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each subproblem (sequence length) has overlapping subproblems, so we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.

The state expression is y and the base case is when x = n (program terminates).

State: (x, y); Transition: 
	(x', y') = ((x+a[x]) % n, y+a[x]),
	y'=y+a[x],
	x'=x+a[x],
	then update state with (x', y')

Use dynamic programming to create a 2D table where the rows represent the sequence length and the columns represent the maximum value of x.

Note: The base case when x = n is correct because at this point, the program has terminated. The transition function is also correct as it simulates the operations performed by the program on the sequence.
The plan includes edge cases such as when x = 0 or x > n, which can be handled by adding additional conditions to the dynamic programming algorithm.
