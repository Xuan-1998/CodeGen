===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

The base case occurs when there are no more values left in the sequence, i.e., x = 0. At this state, y is the final value of interest.

A dynamic programming approach can be applied by defining a state as (x, y) and transitioning to new states based on the values of x and y; using memoization to store intermediate results.

To implement bottom-up dynamic programming with a 2D table:

* Initialize a 2D table dp of size (n+1) x (10^9 + 1), where n is the length of the sequence, initialized with -1.
* Define a function transition(x, y) that simulates one step of the program: increases both x and y by a_{x}, then increases y by a_{x} while decreasing x by a_{x}.
* Fill up the dp table row by row, from (0, 0) to (n, 0), considering each possible state (x, y).
* When calculating the value of dp[x][y], check if it's the base case (x = 0). If so, return y as the final result.
* Otherwise, recursively call transition(x-1, y+a_{x}) and update dp[x][y] accordingly.
* Finally, print out the results in the range [2, n].
