===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each subproblem (sequence length) has overlapping subproblems, so we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.

state: (x, y, cycle_length), where cycle_length is the length of the current repetitive pattern
base case: when the sequence becomes repetitive

Storing the intermediate results in a list and using that list as a lookup table
store states for x = 0 and x = n as base cases to avoid redundant computation
use memoization to store and retrieve previously computed values efficiently
start with an initial state (x, y) = (1, 0) and simulate the sequence until it becomes repetitive or x > n

===END PLAN===
