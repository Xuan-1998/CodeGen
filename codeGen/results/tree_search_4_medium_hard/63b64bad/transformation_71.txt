===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

* Define the state as (x, y) and the transition function as a function that takes the current state and returns the next state.
* Use a dictionary or array to store the values of the sequence.
* Initialize an empty dictionary or array to store the final values of y for each run of the program on the sequence.
* Iterate over the sequence:
    * For each value in the sequence, update the state using the transition function.
    * If the state is (0, y), return y as the final value for that run of the program. This is the base case because when x = 0, there are no more values left in the sequence.
* Return the dictionary or array containing the final values of y for each run of the program on the sequence.

The system can be viewed as a simple automaton with a finite number of states, which can be solved using a loop invariant technique.

Representing the system as a Markov chain and using memoization to avoid repeating calculations:

* Define the state as (x, y) and the transition function as a function that takes the current state and returns the next state.
* Use a dictionary or array to store the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another.
* Initialize an empty dictionary or array to store the final values of y for each run of the program on the sequence.
* Iterate over the sequence:
    * For each value in the sequence, update the state using the transition function and the probability of transitioning to that state.
    * If the state is (0, y), return y as the final value for that run of the program. This is the base case because when x = 0, there are no more values left in the sequence.
* Return the dictionary or array containing the final values of y for each run of the program on the sequence.
