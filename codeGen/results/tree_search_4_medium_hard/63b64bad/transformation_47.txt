===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

The base case occurs when x â‰¤ 0 or x > n, or when the program reaches a point where it does not terminate.

Consider the pair (x, y) as the current state, where x is the current index in the sequence and y is the value of the variable after the last operation.

Implement a recursive function that uses memoization to store the results of previous computations and avoid recalculating them. 

To improve the plan, consider handling edge cases such as when n <= 2, as these would not require any iterations.
