===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

The base case occurs when x â‰¤ 0 or x > n, or when the program reaches a point where it does not terminate.

Consider the pair (x, y) as the current state, where x is the current index in the sequence and y is the value of the variable after the last operation.

Use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. Initialize a dictionary dp with default value -1 for each possible state.

For each state (x, y), calculate the next states ((x + a_x, y + a_x) and (x + a_x - 1, y)) by simulating one step of the program. If either of these new states is in dp, then the current program does not terminate, so return -1.

If neither of these new states is in dp, add them to the dictionary and recursively calculate the final value for each.

Finally, iterate over all possible initial states (x, y) = (1, 0), and use the memoized function to calculate the final value of y for each run of the program on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}, or output -1 if the program does not terminate.
