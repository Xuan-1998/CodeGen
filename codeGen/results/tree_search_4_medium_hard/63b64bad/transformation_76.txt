===BEGIN PLAN===
The sequence values are used in the transitions, so we should focus on identifying the relationships between the state space (sequence length) and the transition rules.

Let's define states as tuples of (x, y), where x is the current position in the sequence and y is the value of y at that position. We can represent the state space as a 2D grid with dimensions n+1 by max(a_i).

Define transitions based on whether x <= 0 or x > n, considering sequence values and updating both x and y accordingly. For states where x <= 0 or x > n, we can immediately terminate the program.

To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can create a memoization dictionary to store intermediate results and avoid redundant computations.

For each state (x, y), calculate the next state by increasing both x and y by a_value = a_x simultaneously. Then, decrease x by a_x while increasing y by a_x.

Use the memoization dictionary to store the results for each state and update it accordingly.

Finally, iterate through all states and find the maximum value of y that can be achieved, or output -1 if the program does not terminate.
