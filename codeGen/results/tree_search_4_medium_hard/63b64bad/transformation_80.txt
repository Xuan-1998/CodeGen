===BEGIN PLAN===
The state is a pair (x, y), where x is the current position in the sequence and y is the value of y at that position.

Consider the sequence values as a function that takes a state (x, y) and returns the next state, using rules for increasing/decreasing x and y simultaneously.

Design a recursive function with memoization to avoid redundant computations. The base case will be when x â‰¤ 0 or x > n, in which case the program terminates and the final value of y is returned.

The recursive function should keep track of the maximum sequence value seen so far. When the program terminates, it should return -1 if the maximum sequence value exceeds a certain threshold (10^9), indicating that the program does not terminate.

The main idea is to build up a table of values for each possible state (x, y) and then look up the final value in this table.
