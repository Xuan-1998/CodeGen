===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states (x, y) and edges represent transitions based on the sequence values; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

The base case occurs when there are no more values left in the sequence, i.e., x = 0. This is the terminating state, so you can return y as the final value.

To improve the plan:

* Use a dictionary or memoization table to store intermediate results and avoid recalculating the same states.
* Initialize the memoization table with the base case values (x = 0) before starting the recursive process.
* Define a function that takes x, y, and the sequence as inputs, and returns the value of y after the program terminates. This will allow you to use the same function for both the recursive and memoized approaches.

Potential issues:

* The plan does not consider edge cases where the sequence values exceed the maximum allowed or are negative.
* The plan assumes that the sequence is well-formed (i.e., a_2, a_3, ..., a_n are all positive integers).
