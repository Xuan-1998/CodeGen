===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y), where x represents the remaining values in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated. Initially, x = 1 and y = 0.

A state can be defined as the maximum value reached so far for x, along with the corresponding final value of y. The transitions would be based on updating this maximum value and the final value of y.

Use a priority queue to efficiently explore the states and avoid exploring unnecessary ones.

To detect non-termination, maintain a flag that is initially set to False. When the program terminates, set the flag to True.

When processing each state, check if the flag is still False. If so, process the state as usual. If not, return -1, indicating non-termination.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
