To solve this problem efficiently, we can use dynamic programming with memoization.

Identify overlapping subproblems: Each sequence length has overlapping subsequences, which means we can break down the problem into smaller subproblems and reuse intermediate results to avoid redundant computation.

State expression: The state of a subproblem is (x, y), where x is the current position in the sequence and y is the value of the variable at that step. This captures the information needed to determine whether the program terminates or not.

Base case: When x â‰¤ 0 or x > n, the program immediately terminates, so this marks the end of a subproblem.

Transition function: The transition from one state (x, y) to another is determined by the operations performed on the sequence. Specifically, we increase both x and y by a[x] simultaneously, then increase y by a[x] while decreasing x by a[x]. This defines the new state (new_x, new_y).

Memoization: We store intermediate results in a dictionary to avoid redundant computation. For each subproblem, we check if the result is already stored before computing it.
