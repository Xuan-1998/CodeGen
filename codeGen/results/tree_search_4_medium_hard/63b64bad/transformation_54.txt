===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y), where x represents the remaining values in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated.

The state can be represented by a pair (x, y) where x is the remaining values in the sequence and y is the final value of y after the program has terminated. The transitions are based on the operations performed by the program: increasing both x and y by a_{x}, then decreasing x by a_{x} while keeping y equal to itself.

Using Python's built-in dynamic programming library, such as lru_cache from functools, to memoize the function that simulates the program's execution. The recursive function would take state (x, y) as input and return the final value of y after the program terminates.

To improve the plan, consider adding a base case for the termination condition: if x is less than or equal to 0 or greater than n, return -1 immediately.

The plan does not explicitly account for edge cases where the sequence contains a single element (x = 1). However, this can be handled by modifying the initial state in the recursive function.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
