===BEGIN PLAN===
The sequence values are used in the transitions, so we should focus on identifying the relationships between the state space (sequence length) and the transition rules.

Define the state as whether the program has terminated or not. The state is the current x and y values, and the transition occurs when we update them according to the given operations.
Let f(x, y) be a function that returns the final value of y if the program terminates. We can use memoization to avoid redundant computations.

The base case for our recursive function would be when x â‰¤ 0 or x > n, in which case the program terminates and we return the current value of y.
For the recursive case, we update x and y according to the given operations: increase both by a_x simultaneously, then increase y by a_x while decreasing x by a_x.

We can use dynamic programming to store the values of f(x, y) for all possible states (x, y), so that we don't need to recompute them. This is because each state depends only on its previous state and not on any other states.
The final answer would be f(1, 0), which is the value of y when x = 1 and y = 0.

This plan seems correct, but it might be helpful to also keep track of whether the program has terminated or not. This could be done by adding an additional variable to our state space.
