===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y, i), where x is the current index in the sequence, y is the final value of y after the program has terminated, and i is the iteration number. This state representation seems correct for describing the problem's dynamic behavior.

However, it might be more efficient to use a simpler state representation that only includes x and i, since y can be calculated using these two values.

Model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations. This approach seems correct for solving this problem using dynamic programming.

To improve the plan, you could consider implementing a base case for the memoization process, such as when x is 0 or x is greater than n.

Potential issues with the plan include:

* The state representation might not be sufficient to capture all possible states in the graph. In this case, you would need to determine the minimum number of indices required to ensure that the program does not terminate.
* There might be edge cases where the program terminates immediately or never terminates at all. You should consider these cases when implementing your solution.

Edge cases to consider:

* When x is 0 or x is greater than n, the program will terminate immediately. In this case, y will be 0.
* When a_x = 1, the program will not terminate and y will increase indefinitely.
