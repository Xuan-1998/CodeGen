===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

State: (x, y), where x is the current index in the sequence, y is the final value of y after the program has terminated.

Create a 2D array or list of lists, dp, where each sub-list represents a row in the tabulation table. The size of the array should be n+1 for n representing the length of the sequence. Initialize the first element (0, 0) to -1 to indicate that it's not possible to reach this state.

For each i from 2 to n:
    For each j from i to 1 (inclusive):
        Calculate a_j = a_i
        If x > i or y < 0, set dp[i][y] = -1; otherwise:
            Recursively calculate the next state and store it in dp[i+1][y+a_i]
        End if
    End for
End for

For each i from n-1 to 1 (inclusive):
    For each j from i to 1 (inclusive):
        If dp[j][i] != -1, set y = i; otherwise, set y = -1
    End for
End for

Return the final value of y.
