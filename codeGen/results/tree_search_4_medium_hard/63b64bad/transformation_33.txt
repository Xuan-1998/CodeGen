===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

The base case occurs when x ≤ 0 or x > n, indicating that the program has terminated.

In each step, consider the current state (x, y) as a node in a graph. Nodes with x ≤ 0 or x > n are terminal nodes representing termination. Edges represent transitions from one state to another based on the sequence values.

Use dynamic programming to build up solutions for smaller subproblems and use them to solve larger problems.

Create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum value of y that can be reached in the ith iteration with x = j. Initialize dp[0][1] = 0 since we start from (x, y) = (1, 0).

For each iteration i and state (x, y), calculate the next state by increasing both x and y by a_{x} simultaneously, then increasing y by a_{x} while decreasing x by a_{x}. Update dp[i+1][j] accordingly.

Use a variable terminated to track whether the program has terminated. If at any point x ≤ 0 or x > n, set terminated = True.

Finally, return dp[n-1][y] as the maximum value of y that can be reached in the last iteration if the program didn't terminate; otherwise, return -1.
