===BEGIN PLAN===
You could model the problem as a graph where nodes represent states and edges represent transitions; then use memoization to avoid repeating calculations.

The base case occurs when x ≤ 0 or x > n, or when the program reaches a point where it does not terminate.
View each step as a transition from one state to another, and define the states based on whether the program terminates or not. Define states as (x, y) tuples, and edges represent the operations: ((x, y), (x + a_x, y)) for increasing x and y by a_x, and ((x + a_x, y + a_x), (x, y + a_x)) for increasing y by a_x while decreasing x by a_x.

Implement memoization with recursive function calls to avoid repeated calculations while exploring the sequence of operations. Define a function f(x, y) that returns -1 if the program does not terminate, and otherwise returns the final value of y when the program terminates.

For each state (x, y), check if x ≤ 0 or x > n, and return -1 in this case. Otherwise, calculate the next states ((x + a_x, y)) and ((x + a_x, y + a_x), (x, y + a_x)), and recursively call f on these states.

Keep track of the final value of y when the program terminates, and store it in a memoization dictionary. Before calculating the next state, check if the result is already stored in the memoization dictionary, and return the stored result in this case to avoid repeated calculations.
