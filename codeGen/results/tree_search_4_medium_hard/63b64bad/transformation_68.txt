===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can define a table dp where dp[i] represents the final value of y after the program has terminated when x = i.

The base case occurs when there are no more values left in the sequence, i.e., x = 0. In this case, the final value of y is 0.

To fill up the dp table, we can start from x = n and go backwards to x = 1. For each x, we calculate the new value of y based on the current value of y and a_x.

If x > n or x â‰¤ 0, the program terminates immediately, so we return -1 in this case.

The updated version of the plan is as follows:
