===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the graph as a tree-like structure and use the observation that if there is no path between u and v, then for any w such that (u & w) = w, there will be no path between w and v. This can help in identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

The state could be whether a path exists from vertex u to some intermediate vertex w, given that there is no edge between u and w. The base case would be when u equals v.

Consider the bitwise AND operation between u and w, and use it as the state. The transition relationship would be if there exists a path from w to v, then it's possible to extend the path to include an edge from u to w.

Use 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents whether there is a path between vertex i and j.

Initialize the base case: dp[u][u] = "YES"

For each pair (u, v), check if dp[u][w] == "YES" for any w such that (u & w) = w. If so, return "YES", as it's possible to extend the path from u to w to include an edge from w to v.

Otherwise, return "NO".
