===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the graph as a tree-like structure and use the observation that if there is no path between u and v, then for any w such that (u & w) = w, there will be no path between w and v. This can help in identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

The state could be the number of vertices reachable by taking at most k edges from vertex u, where k is the maximum distance allowed in the query. The base case would be when k is 0 or when all vertices are reachable up to that distance.

However, there's a potential issue with this approach: it might not correctly handle the edge case where k = 0. To fix this, we can modify the base case to return false when k is 0 and u is not equal to v, since no path exists in this case.

The state could also be a set of all vertices reachable by taking at most k edges from vertex u. The transition relationship could be that if adding vertex w to the set does not create any new paths to other vertices, then the state remains unchanged.

To further optimize the solution, we can use a bit vector to represent the set of reachable vertices. This would allow us to efficiently add and remove vertices from the set as needed.

A memoized function that takes u, v, and k as inputs and returns whether there exists a path between vertices u and v.

We can also add a base case for when k is equal to the maximum distance allowed in the query, since no more edges can be added after this point. This would allow us to correctly handle queries where the maximum distance is greater than 0.
