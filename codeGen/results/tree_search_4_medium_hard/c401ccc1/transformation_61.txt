===BEGIN PLAN===
There are two types of vertices - ones with outgoing edges and those without. The problem can be viewed as finding the shortest path from each vertex to all others. This insight can guide the choice of dynamic programming approach.

The state is a set of sets, where each set represents the vertices reachable from a given vertex. The base case is when the current vertex has no outgoing edges.

State: A set of sets, indicating whether each vertex is reachable or not
Transition: Update the reachable status based on the edges and the current status

To reduce the time complexity, maintain a set of visited vertices during memoization. This ensures that the same subproblems are not solved multiple times.
