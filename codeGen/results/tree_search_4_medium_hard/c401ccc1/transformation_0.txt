===BEGIN PLAN===
The graph can be viewed as a sequence of bits, where each bit represents whether there's an edge from one vertex to another. 
Define the state as: dp[i] = whether there's a path from i to 0 (since all vertices are connected by edges). Base case: dp[0] is always true.
Create a bottom-up dynamic programming solution using a tabulation array, where each cell represents whether there's a path from the corresponding index to 0. 
dp[i] = (i == 0) OR (any j < i such that dp[j] AND ((j & i) == i)) 
Iterate through the array from right to left, updating each cell based on its predecessors.
