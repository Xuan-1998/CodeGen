===BEGIN PLAN===
The graph can be viewed as a sequence of bits, where each bit represents whether there's an edge from one vertex to another. 
Use this insight to formulate the dynamic programming problem.

Define the state as: dp[i] = 1 (since every vertex is reachable by itself in 0 AND operations).

Recursively build up the dp array by considering all possible combinations of bits for each query vertex u_i and v_i.
For each combination, calculate the minimum number of AND operations needed to transform u_i into v_i. 
Memoize the function to avoid redundant calculations.

The final answer is "YES" if there's a path from u_i to v_i (i.e., dp[u_i][v_i] > 0), and "NO" otherwise.
