===BEGIN PLAN===
There are two types of vertices - ones with outgoing edges and those without. The problem can be viewed as finding the shortest path from each vertex to all others. This insight can guide the choice of dynamic programming approach.

The state is the set of all vertices reachable from v, and the base case is when v has no outgoing edges.
State: A subset of vertices reachable from vertex v
Transition: V' = V âˆª {u} if there's an edge from u to any vertex in V

Dynamic programming with a recursive function and memoization
Start by initializing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents whether there is a path from i to j.
For each vertex v, recursively calculate the reachable vertices from it and store them in dp[v][:]
Memoize the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations

The termination condition is when all vertices are processed
Return "YES" if any reachable vertex is equal to the target, otherwise return "NO"
