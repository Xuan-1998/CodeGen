===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the graph as a tree-like structure and use the observation that if there is no path between u and v, then for any w such that (u & w) = w, there will be no path between w and v. This can help in identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
The state could be whether a path exists from vertex u to some intermediate vertex w, given that there is no edge between u and w. The base case would be when u equals v.
Use a 2D array dp where dp[u][w] represents whether there is a path from vertex u to vertex w, given that there is no edge between u and w. The state transition relationship would be if there exists a path from w to v, then it's possible to extend the path to include an edge from u to w.
Use memoization with a hash table memo where the key is the tuple (u, w) and the value is a boolean indicating whether there is a path from vertex u to vertex w given that there is no edge between u and w. Initialize dp[u][w] using memo when calculating dp[u][v].
When checking if there exists a path from u to v, iterate over all vertices w such that (u & w) = w, and for each w, check if there is a path from w to v in the subgraph rooted at w. If yes, then there is a path from u to v.
