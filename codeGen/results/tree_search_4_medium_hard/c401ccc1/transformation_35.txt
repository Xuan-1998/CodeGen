===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the graph as a tree-like structure and use the observation that if there is no path between u and v, then for any w such that (u & w) = w, there will be no path between w and v. This can help in identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

The state could be a 2D table dp where dp[u][k] represents whether there exists a path from vertex u to some vertex with at most k edges. The base case would be when k is 0 or when all vertices are reachable up to that distance.

The transition relationship could be that if a path is found from u to w and also from w to v, then the state changes to true for dp[u][k]. This can be implemented using a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS).

Initialize the table with false values. For each query (u, v), update the state by performing DFS/BFS starting from u and going up to k edges.
