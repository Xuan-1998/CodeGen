===BEGIN PLAN===
There are two types of vertices - ones with outgoing edges and those without. The problem can be viewed as finding the shortest path from each vertex to all others. This insight can guide the choice of dynamic programming approach.

The state is a boolean value indicating whether there's a path from v to any other vertex, and the base case is when v has no outgoing edges. If there are no outgoing edges, then there's no path from v to any other vertex.

State: A boolean value indicating whether there's a path from v to any other vertex
Transition: dp[v] = True if there's an edge from u to v and dp[u] is True for any u

Bottom-up dynamic programming using a loop with memoization
For each vertex v:
    Initialize dp[v] to False
    For each vertex u:
        If there's an edge from u to v and dp[u] is True, set dp[v] to True

The final answer can be obtained by checking the value of dp[v] for all vertices.
