===BEGIN PLAN===
The graph can be viewed as a sequence of bits, where each bit represents whether there's an edge from one vertex to another. Use this insight to formulate the dynamic programming problem.

Define the state as:
dp[u][v] = whether there's a directed path from u to v.
Base case: for any vertex, there's no path to itself.

Transition relationship:
dp[u][v] = OR of all possible paths from vertex u to vertex v with exactly k bits set in common between the two vertices. 

For every neighbor w such that (u & w) == w, recursively calculate dp[w][v]. If the result is true, return true; otherwise, continue the calculation.

Define a function f(u, v) that returns whether there's a directed path from vertex u to vertex v using memoization.
f(u, v) = 
    if (u & v) == v: 
        True
    else:
        dp[u][v] = False
        for w in neighbors(u):
            if (u & w) == w and f(w, v): 
                return True
        return False

Memoization will be used to store the values of dp[u][v].
f(u, v) = memo.get((u, v), f(u, v))
memo[(u, v)] = f(u, v)

The function f will calculate and return whether there's a directed path from vertex u to vertex v.
