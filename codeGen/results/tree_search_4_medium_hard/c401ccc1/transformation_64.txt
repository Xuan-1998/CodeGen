===BEGIN PLAN===
There are two types of vertices - ones with outgoing edges and those without. The problem can be viewed as finding the shortest path from each vertex to all others. This insight can guide the choice of dynamic programming approach.

Let the state be dp where dp[i] is true if there's a path from u to i for some u. The base case is that there are no vertices with an out-degree greater than 1.

dp[i] indicates the existence of a path from i to any other vertex.

The plan can be improved by iterating over all possible paths and checking their validity. This will ensure that all possible paths are considered.

To avoid edge cases, we need to consider the initial state where there's no information about the vertices. In this case, dp[i] should initially be set to false for all i.

Here is the updated plan:
