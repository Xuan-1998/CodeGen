===BEGIN PLAN===
There are two types of vertices - ones with outgoing edges and those without. The problem can be viewed as finding the shortest path from each vertex to all others. This insight can guide the choice of dynamic programming approach.

The state is a boolean array dp where dp[i] is true if there's a path from 0 to i, and false otherwise. The base case is that there's no path to any vertex with an in-degree of 1.

dp[i] = all(u, u & i == i) and dp[u]

The transition function can be improved by considering the edges coming into each vertex and updating the state accordingly. This will allow us to correctly update the state for vertices with outgoing edges.

To make this plan more efficient, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the graph and update the state in O(m + n) time complexity where m is the number of edges and n is the number of vertices. 

The final answer will be the value of dp[v] for each query.
