===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the graph as an AND-OR tree, where each node represents a vertex and its child nodes represent all vertices reachable by taking at most one edge from it.

The state could be the number of vertices reachable by taking at most k edges from vertex u. The base case would be when k is 0 or when all vertices are reachable up to that distance.

To memoize, store the state of each subproblem in a dictionary and return the stored result if it has been computed before. This can help avoid redundant computation and speed up the solution.

The dictionary could be implemented as an adjacency list, where the keys represent vertex IDs and the values represent the number of vertices reachable from that vertex.

To solve the problem, for each query (u, v), use DFS to traverse the tree starting from u, and at each step, update the state by considering the number of vertices reachable by taking at most k edges. If the maximum vertex ID reached is greater than or equal to v, then there exists a path between u and v; otherwise, there isn't.
