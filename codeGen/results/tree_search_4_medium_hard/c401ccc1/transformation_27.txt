===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the graph as a tree-like structure and use the observation that if there is no path between u and v, then for any w such that (u & w) = w, there will be no path between w and v. This can help in identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
The state could be whether a path exists from vertex u to some intermediate vertex w, given that there is no edge between u and w. The base case would be when u equals v.

Memoization using dictionary: Create a dictionary memo where the key is a tuple of (u, w) and the value is boolean indicating whether a path exists.
Memoize all possible states:
    For each vertex u, consider all possible intermediate vertices w such that (u & w) = w
    For each pair (u, w), check if a path exists from u to v given there is no edge between u and w
    If a path exists, add the state (u, w) with value True to memo; otherwise, add it with value False

To answer a query about whether a path exists from vertex u to vertex v:
    Check if (u & v) = v. If not, there is no path, so return False
    Otherwise, check memo for the state (u, v). If True, return True; otherwise, return False

This plan should correctly solve the problem, and it includes edge cases. The potential issue with this plan is that it may take a long time to compute all possible states if there are many vertices in the graph. To improve performance, consider using a priority queue or BFS instead of DFS.
