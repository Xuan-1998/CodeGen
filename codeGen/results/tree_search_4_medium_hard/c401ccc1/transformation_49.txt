===BEGIN PLAN===
There are two types of vertices - ones with outgoing edges and those without. The problem can be viewed as finding the shortest path from each vertex to all others.

The state is a boolean array dp where dp[i] is true if there's a path from 0 to i, and false otherwise.

The base case is that there's no path to any vertex with an in-degree of 1. This ensures that we don't consider vertices that can only be reached through vertices with out-degrees greater than 1.

For each vertex i, we need to check if there's a path from 0 to i. We can do this by checking if there's a path from 0 to j (where j is the bitwise AND of u and i) for some vertex u. If such a path exists and dp[j] is true, then we know that there's also a path from 0 to i.

dp[i] = dp[u] or (u & i == i and dp[i])

To improve this plan, we can consider using a bit-masked array where each element represents whether there's a path from the root vertex to any given vertex. This would allow us to reduce the number of iterations required to compute dp[i].

The potential issue with this plan is that it doesn't handle edge cases well. For example, what if there are vertices with no outgoing edges? We need to ensure that our dynamic programming approach can handle such cases.

One way to improve this plan further would be to consider using a more efficient algorithm like BFS or DFS instead of dynamic programming. This would reduce the time complexity and make the solution more efficient.
