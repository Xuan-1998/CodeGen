===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the graph as a tree-like structure and use the observation that if there is no path between u and v, then for any w such that (u & w) = w, there will be no path between w and v. This can help in identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

The state could be a boolean indicating whether vertex v is reachable from vertex u by taking at most k edges.

The base case would be when k is 0 or when v is the same as u (in which case it's always "YES").

The transition relationship could be that if adding vertex w to the set does not create any new paths to other vertices, then the state remains unchanged. If adding w creates a new path to another vertex z, then update the state accordingly.

Create a dynamic programming table where each cell represents whether vertex v is reachable from vertex u and at most k edges.

For each query, iterate over all vertices w such that (u & w) = w. Check if there's a path from w to v by looking up the value in the DP table for k-1. If it exists, return "YES". If not, return "NO".

This plan considers edge cases and has a clear base case and transition relationship.
