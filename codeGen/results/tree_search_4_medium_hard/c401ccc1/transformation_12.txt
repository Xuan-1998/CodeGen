===BEGIN PLAN===
The graph can be viewed as a sequence of bits, where each bit represents whether there's an edge from one vertex to another. Use this insight to formulate the dynamic programming problem.

Define the state as: dp[u][v] = whether there's a directed path from u to v. Base case: for any vertex, there's no path to itself.

dp[i][j] = ∃w (0 ≤ w < 2^30) and dp[w][i] and (w & i) == i for j from 0 to 2^30 - 1.
Transition relationship: for all possible neighbors w such that (u & w) == w, dp[u][v] = AND of all possible paths from vertex u to vertex v.

For each query (u, v), check if there exists a path from u to v. If yes, output "YES"; otherwise, output "NO".

This plan correctly identifies the dynamic programming problem and formulates the state transition relationship.

To improve the plan, consider optimizing the state space by noticing that for any vertex w, dp[w][i] only depends on i and not on w itself. This allows reducing the state space complexity to O(2^30).

The plan does not include edge cases, but it's possible to extend the base case to handle the case where u or v is out of the valid range.

This plan is correct and can be implemented as a dynamic programming solution.
