===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the graph as a tree-like structure and use the observation that if there is no path between u and v, then for any w such that (u & w) = w, there will be no path between w and v. This can help in identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

The state could be whether a path exists from vertex u to some intermediate vertex w, given that there is no edge between u and w. The base case would be when u equals v.

DP with 2D array: Use a table dp[u][w] to store whether a path exists from vertex u to some intermediate vertex w. Initialize the table as false for all u and w.

For each query (u, v), check if there is an edge from u to v. If not, then check if there is no path between u and v by checking if dp[u][w] is false for any w such that (u & w) = w. If this condition holds, then return "NO". Otherwise, return "YES".

To fill the table dp[u][w], iterate over all vertices from 0 to 2^30-1. For each vertex w, check if there is an edge from u to w and update dp[u][w] accordingly. This can be done by iterating over all vertices and for each vertex v, checking if (u & v) = v.
