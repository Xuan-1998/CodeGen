===BEGIN PLAN===
Let's analyze the plan step by step:

1. The initial intuition is correct - we can view this problem as finding the shortest path from each vertex to all others.

2. The state dp[i] being true if there's a path from u to i for some u is a good starting point.

3. However, we need to rephrase the base case. Instead of "there are no vertices with an out-degree greater than 1", let's say "the graph is connected" - this will ensure that dp[i] being true for all vertices.

4. The recursive formula for updating dp[i] would be: dp[i] = OR (dp[j] and u&j == i) for all j such that j & i == i

5. To avoid redundant computations, we can implement memoization by creating a dictionary memo that stores the value of dp[i] for each i.

6. We start from the initial state where no edges are connected.

7. Then, for each query (u, v), we check if there's a path from u to v by looking up dp[v]. If it's true, return "YES", otherwise return "NO".
