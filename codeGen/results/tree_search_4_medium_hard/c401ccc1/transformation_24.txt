===BEGIN PLAN===
The graph can be viewed as a sequence of bits, where each bit represents whether there's an edge from one vertex to another. 
Use this insight to formulate the dynamic programming problem.

Define the state as: dp[i][j] = number of vertices reachable by i with the first j bits being the same as the corresponding bits in u.
Base case: 1 for all (i, j) since every vertex can reach itself.

Consider a bit at position j in both u and v; 
if the bits are equal, consider only lower bits;
otherwise, update dp[i][j] as sum of previous reachable states with the same first j-1 bits.
Use dynamic programming with a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the number of vertices reachable by i with the first j bits being the same as the corresponding bits in u.

The updated plan is correct, but it can be improved by considering edge cases: what if there are no edges between two given vertices? 
This can be handled by setting a minimum value (like -1) for unreachable states.
Edge cases include:
u = v
u < v
u > v
