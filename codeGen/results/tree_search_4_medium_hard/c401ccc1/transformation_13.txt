===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize dp array of size (2**30) * (2**30).

Define the state as: dp[u][v] = whether there's a directed path from u to v. Base case: for any vertex, there's no path to itself.
dp[u][v] represents the existence of a path from vertex u to vertex v.

Transition relationship:
for each w in range(2**30):
    if (u & w) == w:
        dp[u][v] = and(dp[u][w], dp[w][v])

Memoize results by storing them in an array.
For each query, return dp[u][v].

Edge cases: Handle queries where u and v are the same vertex or checking for invalid inputs.

return dp
