===BEGIN PLAN===
The graph can be viewed as a sequence of bits, where each bit represents whether there's an edge from one vertex to another. Use this insight to formulate the dynamic programming problem.

Define the state as: dp[u][v] = whether there's a directed path from u to v. Base case: for any vertex, there's no path to itself.

dp[i] = [1 if (i & j) == i and dp[j][0] else 0 for j in range(2**30)]

Transition relationship: dp[u][v] = 1 if and only if there exists some neighbor w such that (u & w) == w and a path from w to v.

for i in range(2**30): 
    dp[i] = [any(j in range(2**30)) and (i & j) == i and dp[j][0] for _ in range(2**30)]
