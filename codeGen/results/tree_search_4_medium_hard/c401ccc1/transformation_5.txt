===BEGIN PLAN===
The graph can be viewed as a sequence of bits, where each bit represents whether there's an edge from one vertex to another. 
Define the state as: dp[i] = whether there exists a path from i to 0 (since all vertices are connected by edges). 
Base case: dp[0] is always true.
dp[i] = any(dp[u] for u in range((i.bit_length() - 1), -1, -1) if not (i & (1 << u))); 
Use a list comprehension with a conditional statement to generate the values of dp. This condition ensures that there's an edge from i to u and then a path from u to 0.
