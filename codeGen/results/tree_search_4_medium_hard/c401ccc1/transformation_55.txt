===BEGIN PLAN===
There are two types of vertices - ones with outgoing edges and those without. The problem can be viewed as finding the shortest path from each vertex to all others. This insight can guide the choice of dynamic programming approach.

The state is the set of all vertices reachable from v, and the base case is when v has no outgoing edges.

State: A subset of vertices reachable from vertex v,
Transition: V' = V ∪ {u} if there's an edge from u to any vertex in V

Bottom-up dynamic programming with a tabulated solution
For each vertex v:
  Initialize dp[v] as an empty set
  For each neighbor u of v:
    If u is not in dp[v], then update dp[v] = dp[v] ∪ {u}
  Return dp

Note: The plan seems correct, but it would be beneficial to add a condition to handle the case where there are no outgoing edges from any vertex.
