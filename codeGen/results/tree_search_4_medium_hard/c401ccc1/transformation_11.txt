===BEGIN PLAN===
The graph can be viewed as a sequence of bits, where each bit represents whether there's an edge from one vertex to another. Use this insight to formulate the dynamic programming problem.

Define the state as: dp[u][v] = whether there's a directed path from u to v. Base case: for any vertex, there's no path to itself.

dp[u][v] represents the existence of a path from vertex u to vertex v. Transition relationship: dp[u][v] = OR of all possible paths from vertex u to vertex v, considering each neighbor w such that (u & w) == w and not visited[w].

Implement an iterative function with memoization.

Create a visited array to keep track of the vertices that have been processed.
Initialize the dp table with False for all pairs (u, v).
Iterate over all vertices u. For each vertex u:
    Iterate over all vertices v such that (u & v) == v and not visited[v].
    Update the dp[u][v] = OR of dp[u][w] and dp[w][v].

Print "YES" if there's a path from u to v, otherwise print "NO".
