===BEGIN PLAN===
The graph can be viewed as a sequence of bits, where each bit represents whether there's an edge from one vertex to another. Use this insight to formulate the dynamic programming problem.

Define the state as: dp[i] = number of vertices reachable by i. Base case: 1 for all vertices (since every vertex can reach itself).

dp[u][v] is not well-defined, since it represents a minimum number of AND operations needed to transform u into v, which doesn't make sense in this context.

Instead, define the state as: dp[i] = 1 if i-th bit can be reached from the initial vertex (0), otherwise dp[i] = 0. This means we're counting the number of vertices that can be reached by applying AND operations starting from the initial vertex.

The dynamic programming equation would be:
dp[i] = min(dp[j]) for all j such that u & j = i, where u is the initial vertex.

Base case: dp[0] = 1 (since we start with the initial vertex).

Tabulate the number of reachable vertices for each vertex after applying AND operations. Then, use this table to determine whether there's a path between two given vertices.

To check if there's a path from u to v, simply check if dp[v] is 1 or not.
