===BEGIN PLAN===
State: A boolean vector indicating whether each vertex is reachable or not, 
Transition: Update the reachable status based on the edges and the current status
Use bit manipulation to reduce the state space by only considering reachable vertices and their bits
Initialize a set of all vertices as the initial state
For each query (u, v), 
  Start from v, update the reachable status based on outgoing edges
  Keep updating until no more changes are made
  If vertex u is reachable, print "YES", otherwise print "NO"
