===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the graph as a tree-like structure and use the observation that if there is no path between u and v, then for any w such that (u & w) = w, there will be no path between w and v. This can help in identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

The state could be a boolean indicating whether there exists a path from vertex u to vertex v, with the initial state being false for all vertices. The transition relationship could be that if a path is found from u to w and also from w to v, then the state changes to true. This can be implemented using a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS).

To optimize the DFS/BFS, use a priority queue to prioritize the vertices that are closer to v when exploring the graph.

The function to check if there is a path between u and v could be:

- If u == v, return true
- For each neighbor w of u:
  - If (u & w) = w:
    - Perform DFS/BFS from w to v, and if a path is found, return true
  - If no path is found after exploring all neighbors, return false

The base case would be when k is 0 or when all vertices are reachable up to that distance.
