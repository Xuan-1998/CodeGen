===BEGIN PLAN===
The graph can be viewed as a sequence of bits, where each bit represents whether there's an edge from one vertex to another. Use this insight to formulate the dynamic programming problem.

Define the state as:
dp[i] = whether there's a path from i to 0 (since all vertices are connected by edges). Base case: dp[0] is always true.

For each query (u, v), check if there's a path from u to v using the dynamic programming states. If there is, return "YES". Otherwise, return "NO".

The loop for updating and storing the dynamic programming state dp[i] will be:
for i in range(2**30):
    dp[i] = (i == 0 or sum((not (i & (1 << j))) % 2 for j in range(i.bit_length())))

This plan takes into account that all vertices are connected by edges, which is an important property of the problem.

The loop iterates over all possible values of i and calculates dp[i] based on whether there's a path from i to 0. This means that the dynamic programming state only depends on the previous states, not on the query (u, v).

This plan handles edge cases by considering all possible values of i, so it's unlikely to miss any important cases.
