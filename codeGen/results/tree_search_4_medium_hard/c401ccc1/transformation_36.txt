===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the graph as a tree-like structure and use the observation that if there is no path between u and v, then for any w such that (u & w) = w, there will be no path between w and v. This can help in identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

The state could be the number of vertices reachable by taking at most k edges from vertex u, where k is the maximum distance allowed in the query. The base case would be when k is 0 or when all vertices are reachable up to that distance.

However, this approach might not work as the graph is not necessarily a tree, and the condition (u & w) = w does not guarantee that there will be no path between w and v.

A better approach could be to use memoization with a depth-first search (DFS). The state could be a dictionary where the key is the pair (u, k) and the value is a boolean indicating whether there is a path from u to any vertex at most k edges away. The transition relationship would be that if a path is found from u to w at most k-1 edges away and also a path is found from w to v at most 1 edge away, then the state changes to true.

The initial state could be false for all vertices. This approach ensures that we do not revisit the same subproblem multiple times.
