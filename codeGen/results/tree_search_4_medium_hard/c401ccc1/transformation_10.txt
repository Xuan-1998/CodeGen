===BEGIN PLAN===
The graph can be viewed as a sequence of bits, where each bit represents whether there's an edge from one vertex to another. Use this insight to formulate the dynamic programming problem.

Define the state as: dp[u][v] = whether there's a directed path from u to v. Base case: for any vertex, there's no path to itself.
dp[u][v] represents the existence of a path from vertex u to vertex v. Transition relationship:
    for each neighbor w such that (u & w) == w and not visited[w]:
        dp[u][v] = OR of all possible paths from vertex u to vertex w, considering edge (u, w), and then recursively apply this function to check if there's a path from w to v.
Apply memoization using a dictionary to store intermediate results.

To improve the plan:

*   Ensure that the base case is correctly implemented to handle self-loops.
*   In the transition relationship, consider whether it's necessary to check for visited[w] or not, as the problem statement doesn't explicitly state any edge restrictions.
