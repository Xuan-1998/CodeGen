===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i] be true if there's a path from u to i for some u.

The state dp[u] is true if and only if there exists v such that u & v = v.

Use dynamic programming to fill up a table where each row represents a vertex, and the cell at row i and column j is True if there's a path from i to j.

For each query (u, v), check dp[v] in the table. If it's true, then there's a path from u to v. Otherwise, return "NO".

If there are multiple queries with the same vertex, we only need to update the table once for that vertex.
