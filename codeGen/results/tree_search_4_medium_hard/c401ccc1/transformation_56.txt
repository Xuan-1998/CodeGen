===BEGIN PLAN===
There are two types of vertices - ones with outgoing edges and those without. The problem can be viewed as finding the shortest path from each vertex to all others. This insight can guide the choice of dynamic programming approach.

The state is the set of all vertices reachable from v, and the base case is when v has no outgoing edges.

State: The current vertex v
Transition:
    If there's no outgoing edge from v, the state remains unchanged;
    Otherwise, it becomes the set of all vertices reachable from the adjacent vertex

DP with a recursive function and memoization to store intermediate results

The transition function can be optimized by only considering vertices that are reachable from v. This reduces the number of states to consider.

In the base case, when v has no outgoing edges, the state remains unchanged. If there is an edge from v to w, then the set of all vertices reachable from w includes all vertices reachable from v.

The recursive function can be implemented as follows:

- If v has no outgoing edges, return the current state
- Otherwise, for each adjacent vertex w, recursively call the function with the updated state and memoize the result
- Combine the results to get the final state

The plan also includes edge cases. For example, if all vertices have no outgoing edges, then there is no path between any two vertices.

The plan can be improved by considering the properties of the infinite graph. Since the graph is infinite, the DP table will need to store an infinite number of states. However, since the problem only requires us to determine whether a path exists or not, we can use a boolean value to indicate whether a path exists from v to w.
