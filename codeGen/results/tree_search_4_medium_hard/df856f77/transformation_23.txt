===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of operations required to make the array strictly increasing up to index i.

The optimal solution is to use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach. Initialize an empty dictionary memo and set dp[0] = 0, as there are no operations needed for a single-element array.

For each element A[i], find the longest increasing subsequence ending at indices j < i such that A[j] < A[i]. Update dp[i] as the minimum of its current value and dp[j-1] + 1 (the cost to make the subarray strictly increasing up to index j) for all such j.

Finally, return dp[n-1], where n is the length of the array. This represents the minimum number of operations required to make the entire array strictly increasing.
