===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution is to use dynamic programming with memoization and backtracking, identifying the longest increasing subsequence first.

Consider dp[i] as the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing, given that A[i-1] is in its correct position. 

Let dp[i] be the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing. Define transition relationships based on the comparison between adjacent elements: 
    - If Ai > Ai+1, then dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1; 
    - Otherwise, dp[i] can take the value of either dp[i-1] or dp[i-2], depending on whether Ai+1 is greater than any previous element in A. 

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by iterating through the array and maintaining a table of minimum number of operations for each prefix.

If Ai > Ai+1, then Ai+1 should be increased to make it equal to Ai.
If Ai <= Ai+1, then Ai+1 is already correct, so dp[i] can take the value of either dp[i-1] or dp[i-2], depending on whether Ai+1 is greater than any previous element in A.

The final answer is dp[N-1].

This plan should work for all cases including edge cases. It's a complete solution and it doesn't have any potential issues.
