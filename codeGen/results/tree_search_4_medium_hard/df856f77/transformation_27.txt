===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution is to use dynamic programming with bottom-up tabulation and memoization.

Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of operations required to make the array strictly increasing up to index i.

dp[0] = 0
For each element A[i], consider two options:
1. Keep the current value, which means we have to perform at least one operation for all previous elements.
2. Change the current value to be greater than or equal to the previous maximum value (max(0, dp[i-1]) + (A[i] > max(0, dp[i-1])) ? 1 : 0).

dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + (A[i] != A[i-1]), i)
The final answer is dp[N-1], where N is the length of the array.

This plan avoids unnecessary computations by only considering the minimum number of operations required to make the array strictly increasing up to index i.
It also ensures that each element is considered at most once, preventing redundant calculations and improving efficiency.
