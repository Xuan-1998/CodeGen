===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution is to use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach and a 2D array dp[][] where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0...i] strictly increasing up to index j.

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0...i] strictly increasing up to index j. Then, dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j-1] + 1 for k in range(i) if A[k] < A[j]).

Use a single array dp[] where dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0...i] strictly increasing. Then, dp[i] = min(dp[k] + 1 for k in range(i) if A[k] < A[i]).

Initialize dp[0] as 0, since no operations are needed to make the empty array strictly increasing.
The final answer is dp[N-1], which represents the minimum number of operations required to make the entire array strictly increasing.
