===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution is to use bottom-up dynamic programming with iteration and memoization, identifying the longest increasing subsequence first.

Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of operations required to make the array strictly increasing up to index i. Let lis[i] represent the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.

lis[0] = 1
For each i from 1 to N-1:
    if A[i] > A[i-1]: // A[i] can be appended to the longest increasing subsequence
        lis[i] = lis[i-1] + 1
    else: // A[i] cannot be appended, so reset the length of the longest increasing subsequence
        lis[i] = 1

dp[i] = sum(min(1, abs(A[i]-A[k])) for k in range(i)) - (lis[i] - 1)
For each i from N-2 to 0:
    dp[i] += min(dp[i+1], dp[N-1])
