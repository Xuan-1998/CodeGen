===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach where we fill up the dp table in a bottom-up manner, starting from the smallest subproblems.

state dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i with value j.
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k-1] + 1 for k in range(1, j+1) if A[k-1] < A[k]) if j > 0, else j;
Tabulate the solution by precomputing all possible subproblems for each element in the array, then selecting the minimum number of operations from those subproblems.
