===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using tabulation by constructing the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] where j is a possible value for the (i+1)th element, and dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarray A[0..i] with A[i+1]=j strictly increasing.

Initialize a 2D list dp of size N x max(A), where N is the length of the array and max(A) is the maximum value in the array, set all values in dp to infinity. This represents that initially there are no operations needed for any subarray.

For i from 1 to N:
    For j from min(A[i-1],max(A)) down to 1:
        If A[i-1] > j, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][A[i]] + 1 else dp[i][j] = 0

Return dp[N-1][A[N-1]]
