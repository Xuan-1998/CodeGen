===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach where we fill up the dp table in a bottom-up manner, starting from the smallest subproblems.

state dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i with value j.
dp[i][j] = j + sum(dp[i-1][k-1] for k in range(j+1) if A[k-1] < A[k]) if j > 0, else j;

Implement memoization using a dictionary to store and retrieve previously computed values of dp[i][j].
state memo = {}

for i in range(1, N):
    for j in range(len(A)):
        if not (i == 1 or j == 0): # base case: first element or the first number in the array
            if A[j-1] >= A[j]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = j - (memo.get((i-1, j-1), 0) or 0)
        else:
            dp[i][j] = j

min_ops = sum(dp[-1])
