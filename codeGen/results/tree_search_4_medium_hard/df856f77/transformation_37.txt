===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution is to use dynamic programming with bottom-up memoization and iteration.

Define dp[i] as the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing. Initialize dp as a list of N zeros.

dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + 1 for j in range(i) if A[j] < A[i])
for i in range(1, N):
    for j in range(i):
        if A[j] < A[i]:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j-1] + 1)

Return dp[-1]
