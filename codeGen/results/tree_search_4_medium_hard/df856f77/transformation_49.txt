===BEGIN PLAN===
Construct a table dp with size N+1 where dp[i] is the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing.

Let dp[0] = 0, since there's no need for operations when the array is empty or has only one element.

For i in range(1, N):
    dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + |A[i] - A[j-1]| for j in range(1, i+1)) if A[i] > A[k-1] and k-1 >= 0
    else: dp[i] = dp[i-1]

Use a dictionary memo to store the intermediate results and avoid repeated calculations.
For example, memo[dp[i]] could store the value of dp[i].

To make the plan more efficient, you can use a two-pointer approach. Initialize two pointers, left and right, both at 0.

While right < N:
    if A[left] > A[right]:
        dp[right+1] = min(dp[right], dp[left-1] + |A[right+1] - A[left]|)
        left += 1
    else:
        right += 1

Finally, return dp[N] which is the minimum number of operations required to make the entire array strictly increasing.
