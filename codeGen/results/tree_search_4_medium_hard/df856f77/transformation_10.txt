===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i] will store the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i.
Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i. State: The current subarray A[:i+1]. Transition: We either keep the current element as is, or increase it by 1 until we find an element that makes the subarray strictly increasing.

dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + A[j-1] - A[i]) for j in range(i) if A[j] <= A[i]
This plan considers edge cases correctly. It takes into account the possibility of having to increase elements by 1 to make the array strictly increasing.
The only issue with this plan is that it doesn't handle the case where the element at index i needs to be decreased to make the array strictly increasing. This could be handled by adding an additional condition: dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + A[j-1] - (A[i]-1)) for j in range(i) if A[j] <= A[i]
