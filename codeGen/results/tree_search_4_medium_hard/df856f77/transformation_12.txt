===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach where we fill up the dp table in a bottom-up manner, starting from the smallest subproblems.

dp[i] will store the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i.

Define dp[i] as the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i, considering only the elements in [0..i]. State: The current subarray A[0:i+1]. Transition: We try all possible ways to increase A[i] such that the array becomes strictly increasing. For example, if A[i-1] > A[i], then we can make it strictly increasing by setting A[i] = A[i-1]-1.

dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1) for j in range(i) where A[j] >= A[i]

The plan is correct, but it can be improved by handling the edge case where i is 0. For this case, we set dp[0] as 0 because no operations are needed to make an empty array strictly increasing.
