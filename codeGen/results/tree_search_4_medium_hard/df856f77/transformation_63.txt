===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using tabulation by constructing the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array.
Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing, assuming that A[i] is in its optimal position.

dp[i] can be calculated as the sum of two values:
- The minimum number of operations required to make the first i elements strictly increasing (which is dp[i-1])
- The minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing, by trying to minimize the maximum value in the subarray (which can be calculated using a binary search)

Maintain an array dp of size N+1, where dp[i] is the minimum number of operations required to make the first i+1 elements strictly increasing.
Initialize dp[0] as 0.

For each i from 1 to N:
    - Initialize min_ops as infinity
    - For j from 1 to i:
        - If A[j-1] > A[i], calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..j] strictly increasing by trying to minimize the maximum value in the subarray, and update min_ops if necessary
    - Update dp[i] as the sum of dp[i-1] and min_ops

Return dp[N]
