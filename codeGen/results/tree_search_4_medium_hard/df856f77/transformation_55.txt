===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using tabulation by constructing the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array.
Let the state expression be dp[i] representing the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing.
dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing. 
dp[i] can be calculated as follows: 
dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + 1 for j in range(1, i) and A[j] > A[j-1]) where j is the previous strictly increasing index.
Use a dictionary dp to store the dynamic programming table values, with keys being indices and values being the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray strictly increasing.

To improve the plan:

* Initialize dp[0] = 0 since it takes no operations to make an array of length 1 strictly increasing.
* For i > 0:
	+ Calculate dp[i] using the recurrence relation: 
	+ if A[i] > A[i-1], then dp[i] = dp[i-1]
	+ else, dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + 1 for j in range(1, i) and A[j] > A[j-1])
* Return dp[n-1] as the minimum number of operations required to make the entire array strictly increasing.

Potential issues with the plan:

* The plan assumes that the input array is non-empty. If the input array can be empty, add a special case for dp[0].
* The plan does not handle edge cases where A[i] < A[i-1]. This can be handled by initializing dp[i] = 0 in this case.

Edge cases:

* If the input array has length 1, return 0 as no operations are needed.
* If the input array is empty, return 0 as no operations are needed.
