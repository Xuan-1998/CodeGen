===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using tabulation by constructing the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array.

Let the state expression be dp[i] representing the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing. The base case is when i = 0, in which case dp[0] = 0 because no operations are needed to make an empty array strictly increasing.

For i > 0, dp[i] can be calculated as follows:

dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + |A[i] - A[j]| for j in range(1, i))

This expression calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing. The expression considers all possible previous indices j that make the subarray A[0..j] strictly increasing, and then adds the absolute difference between A[i] and A[j] to calculate the minimum number of operations required to extend the increasing sequence up to index i.

Initialize a list dp with a size of N+1 and set all elements in dp to infinity. Then update dp[i] based on the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing.

Finally, return dp[N] as the minimum number of operations required to make the entire array A[0..N] strictly increasing.
