===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using tabulation by constructing the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array.

Let the state expression be dp[i] representing the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing.

dp[i] can be calculated as follows: dp[i] = min(dp[j] + |A[i] - A[j]| for j in range(0, i)) where j is the previous strictly increasing index. We also need to initialize dp[0] to 0 because an array with only one element is already strictly increasing.

Create a dynamic programming table with size N+1 and initialize each dp[i] to infinity. Initialize dp[0] to 0.

For each i from 1 to N:
    For j from 0 to i-1:
        Calculate the minimum number of operations required to make A[0..i] strictly increasing by considering the previous strictly increasing index j.
        Update dp[i] if the calculated value is less than its current value.
Return dp[N] as the minimum number of operations required to make the entire array strictly increasing.
