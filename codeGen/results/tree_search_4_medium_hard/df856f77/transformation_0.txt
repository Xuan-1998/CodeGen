===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] will represent the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i, considering that A[i-1] <= j.

Create a 2D table dp where dp[0][i] = 0 for all i, since there are no operations required initially. This is because the first element in the array is already the smallest (or equal) to itself.

For each i from 1 to N-1:
    Initialize min_ops as infinity
    For j from A[i-1]+1 to A[i]:
        Calculate min_ops for this subproblem: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + (A[i]-j)) where k ranges from A[i-1]+1 to j. This is because we need to make the element at index i equal to j, and then compare it with all previous elements.
        Update min_ops if this subproblem has a smaller number of operations
    dp[i][A[i]] = min_ops + 1 (since we always increment A[i])

Return dp[N-1][A[N-1]]
