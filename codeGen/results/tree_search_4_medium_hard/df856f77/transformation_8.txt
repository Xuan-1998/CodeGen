===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming where we fill up the dp table in a bottom-up manner, starting from the smallest subproblems.

dp[i][j] will represent the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i, considering that A[i-1] <= j.

A state can be a pair (i, j) where i is the current index and j is the target value. The next state will be (i+1, k) where k is either j+1 or the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i-1.

We need to set up base cases for dp[0][j] which would represent the minimum number of operations needed to make an empty array strictly increasing. For example, if A[0] = 1 and j is any value greater than or equal to 1, then dp[0][j] = 0 because we can make the array strictly increasing by just leaving it as it is.

Then, for each i from 1 to N-1 and for each j from A[i-1]+1 to j_max (where j_max is the maximum value in the array), we need to calculate dp[i][j]. This would be either j-A[i-1] or dp[i-1][k] where k is the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i-1, considering that A[i-2] <= k.

The final answer will be dp[N-1][max_val], where max_val is the maximum value in the array. This represents the minimum number of operations needed to make the entire array strictly increasing.
