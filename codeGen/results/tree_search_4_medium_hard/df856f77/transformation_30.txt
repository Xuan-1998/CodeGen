===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution is to use top-down memoization with recursion and backtracking, identifying the longest increasing subsequence first.

Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of operations required to make the array strictly increasing up to index i.

1. Initialize a memoization table dp of size N+1 with all values set to infinity.
2. Define a recursive function f(i) that calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the array strictly increasing up to index i:
    - If the subarray A[0...i] is already strictly increasing, return 0.
    - Otherwise, consider inserting an element at each position k in [0...i-1] such that A[i] > A[k]:
        - For each k, calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0...k] strictly increasing (dp[k]).
        - Add 1 to this value to account for inserting A[i] at position k.
        - Return the minimum value among these calculations.

3. Fill up the memoization table dp by calling f(i) for each i in [0...N-1].
4. The final answer is dp[N-1].
