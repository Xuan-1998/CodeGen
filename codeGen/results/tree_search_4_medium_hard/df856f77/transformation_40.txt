===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution is to use dynamic programming with bottom-up approach.

Consider dp[i] as the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing, given that A[i-1] is in its correct position.

Let's fill up the dp array in a single pass. We can start from i = 1 and for each i, we need to consider all j such that 0 <= j < i. For each such j, if A[j] < A[i], then we have two choices:
- Consider A[j] as the last element of an increasing subarray ending at i (dp[j] + (i - j)), or
- We do not include A[j] in our increasing subarray.

We take the minimum of these two options and store it in dp[i]. This is because we want to minimize the number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i.

The base case for this dynamic programming is dp[0] = 0, since there are no operations needed to make an empty array strictly increasing.

Finally, the minimum number of operations needed to make the entire array strictly increasing is stored in dp[n-1], where n is the length of the array.
