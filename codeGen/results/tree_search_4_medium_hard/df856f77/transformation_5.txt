===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach where we fill up the dp table in a bottom-up manner, starting from the smallest subproblems.

dp[i][j] will represent the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i, considering that A[i-1] <= j.

Consider dp[i-1][j-1] as the state and transition is based on whether A[i-1] > j or not.

Create a 2D table with dimensions (N+1) x (A_max + 1), where N is the length of the array, and A_max is the maximum element in the array. Use a nested loop to fill it up with the minimum number of operations, while updating the values based on the previous ones.

Initially, all dp[i][j] will be set to infinity (or a very large value), except for dp[0][A[0]], which will be 0 (since we don't need any operations to make an empty array strictly increasing).

For each i from 1 to N:
    For each j from A[i-1] + 1 to A_max:
        If A[i-1] <= j, dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][A[i-1]], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1 (since we either need to keep the previous element or increment it by 1)
        Else, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][A[i-1]] + 1

The final answer will be dp[N][A_max].
