===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using tabulation by constructing the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array.

Let the state expression be dp[i] representing the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing.

dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing. dp[i] can be calculated as follows:
    dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + |A[j] - A[j-1]| for j in range(1, i)) where j is the previous strictly increasing index.

Create a 2D array dp to store the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array. The base case would be when the subarray has only one element, in which case no operations are needed (dp[0] = 0).

To calculate dp[i], iterate from j = 1 to i and find the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..j-1] strictly increasing. Then, add the absolute difference between A[j] and A[j-1] to this minimum number. This is because we need to either increase or decrease A[j] by |A[j] - A[j-1]| units to make it greater than A[j-1].

The time complexity of this plan would be O(n^2) due to the nested loop, and the space complexity would be O(n) for storing the dp array.
