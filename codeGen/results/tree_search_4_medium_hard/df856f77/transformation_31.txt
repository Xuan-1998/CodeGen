===BEGIN PLAN===
Define dp as a dictionary where dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations needed to make subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing.

1. For i = 0, set dp[0] = 0 since no operations are needed for a single element.
2. Iterate from i = 1 to N-1:
   - Initialize min_ops as infinity.
   - Iterate from j = 0 to i-1:
     - If A[j] < A[i], calculate the number of operations needed to make subarray A[0..j] strictly increasing and add 1 (since we need to change A[j] to be greater than or equal to A[i]).
     - Update min_ops with the minimum value between min_ops and this calculated number.
   - Set dp[i] as min_ops.

3. Return dp[N-1], which represents the minimum number of operations needed to make the entire array strictly increasing.
