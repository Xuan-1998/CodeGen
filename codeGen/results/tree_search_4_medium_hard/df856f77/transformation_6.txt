===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach where we fill up the dp table in a bottom-up manner, starting from the smallest subproblems.

dp[i][j] will represent the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i, considering that A[i-1] <= j.

A state can be a pair (i, j) where i is the current index and j is the target value. The next state will be (i+1, k) where k is either j+1 or the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i-1.

Use a 2D tabulation approach by initializing dp with a grid filled with infinity values and updating it iteratively as you iterate through the input array. Initialize dp[0][j] for all j to be 0, since we don't need any operations to make an empty array strictly increasing.

Start from the smallest subproblems, filling up the dp table row by row, considering each element A[i] and its corresponding target value j=A[i-1].

For each cell dp[i][j], calculate the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i, considering that A[i-1] <= j.

The final answer will be dp[N-1][A[N-1]], which represents the minimum number of operations needed to make the entire array strictly increasing.
