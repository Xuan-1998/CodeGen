===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using tabulation by constructing the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array.

Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing, assuming that A[i] is in its optimal position.
dp[i] could be the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing, considering all possible insertions or deletions of numbers up to i.

Initialize dp[0] as 0, since the base case is an empty array (no operations needed).
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by iterating from i = 1 to N-1:
    For each i, calculate dp[i] as the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i-1] strictly increasing, and then consider two possibilities:
        1. Insert A[i] in its optimal position: This might require some operations (dp[i-1]) plus one operation for inserting A[i].
        2. Delete a number less than A[i]: This requires dp[i-1] minus the number of deletions needed to make A[0..i-1] strictly increasing.
    Choose the minimum between these two possibilities and add it to dp[i].

Finally, return dp[N-1], which represents the minimum number of operations required to make the entire array strictly increasing.
