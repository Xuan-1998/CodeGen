===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach where we fill up the dp table in a bottom-up manner, starting from the smallest subproblems.

dp[i][j] will represent the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i, considering that A[i-1] <= j.

To calculate dp[i][j], we need to consider two possibilities:
1. We can keep the current element unchanged.
2. We can change the current element to a value greater than or equal to A[i-1].

The minimum number of operations is the minimum of these two possibilities, plus 1 (for the operation itself).

We fill up the 2D table dp where dp[i][j] is calculated as:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k]+1 for k in range(A[i-1], j+1)) + (dp[i-1][A[i-1]-1] == 0 ? 0 : 1)

The base case is when i=0, dp[0][j]=0.

We iterate over the array from i=0 to N-1 and for each index, we calculate dp[i][j] for all j in range(A[i], max_val+1), where max_val is the maximum value in the array.
