===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution is to use bottom-up dynamic programming, identifying the longest increasing subsequence first.

Define dp[i] as the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing.
dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + 1 for j in range(i) if A[j] < A[i])

Implement a bottom-up dynamic programming function that iterates over the array and updates the dp array based on the definition above.

The base case is when i=0, where dp[0]=0 (no operations needed).

The recurrence relation can be simplified as:
dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + 1 for j in range(i) if A[j] < A[i])

Implement a loop that iterates over the array and updates the dp array based on the recurrence relation.

The final result is the minimum number of operations needed to make the entire array strictly increasing, which is stored in dp[n-1].
