===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using tabulation by constructing the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array.

Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing, assuming that A[i] is in its optimal position.
dp[i] is the minimum number of operations required to make the prefix A[0..i] strictly increasing by trying to minimize the maximum value in the prefix.

Consider a bottom-up approach where we start with the smallest possible subproblems and gradually build up to the original problem. Initialize dp[0] to 0 because an array of length 1 is already strictly increasing.

For each i from 1 to N-1, compute dp[i] as follows:

dp[i] = min(dp[j] + (A[j+1] - A[j]) for j from 0 to i-1)
This represents the minimum number of operations required to make the prefix A[0..i] strictly increasing. The value A[j+1] - A[j] is the difference between two consecutive elements, and we need to decide whether to increase or decrease this element to make the array strictly increasing.

Finally, return dp[N-1] as the minimum number of operations required to make the entire array strictly increasing.
