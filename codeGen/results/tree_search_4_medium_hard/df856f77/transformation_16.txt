state dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i with value j.

dp[0][j] = 0 for all j (base case: no operations are required for an empty array)
dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][A[k-1]] + A[k] - A[min(k for k in range(i))]) 
            if dp[k][A[k-1]] is defined and A[k] > A[min(k for k in range(i))], else 0
for i from 1 to N-1
    for j from min(A) to max(A)
        update dp[i][j]
