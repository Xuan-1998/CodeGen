===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution is to use bottom-up dynamic programming with memoization and backtracking, identifying the longest increasing subsequence first.

Define dp[i] as the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing.
dp[0] = 0 for the base case

For i > 0:
    If all(A[:i+1]) are already strictly increasing, then dp[i] = dp[i-1]
    Otherwise, dp[i] = min(1 + dp[j-1] for j in range(i) if A[j] < A[i])
    and update the memoization table with the minimum value found.

Define a function with optional arguments for memoization:

function solve(A):
    memo = {}
    def dp(i):
        if i not in memo:
            if all(A[:i+1]) are already strictly increasing:
                memo[i] = dp[i-1]
            else:
                memo[i] = min(1 + dp[j-1] for j in range(i) if A[j] < A[i])
            return memo[i]
        return memo[i]

    return dp(len(A))
