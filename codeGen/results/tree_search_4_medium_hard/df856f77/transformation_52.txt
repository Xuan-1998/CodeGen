===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using tabulation by constructing the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array.
Let the state expression be dp[i] representing the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing.
dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing. dp[i] can be calculated as follows: 
    dp[i] = min(dp[j] + |A[i] - A[j]| for j in range(0, i)) where j is the previous strictly increasing index.
Initialize a dictionary dp with key-value pairs (i, 0) for i in range(N+1), where N is the length of the array.
For each i from 1 to N:
    Initialize min_ops as infinity
    For each j from 0 to i-1:
        Calculate the operations required to make A[0..j] strictly increasing and then append |A[i] - A[j]| operations to it. 
        Update min_ops if this is less than its current value.
    Set dp[i] as the minimum number of operations
Use a dictionary to store the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array, where the key is the index i and the value is the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing.
