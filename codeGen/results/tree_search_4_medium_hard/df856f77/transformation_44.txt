===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution is to use dynamic programming and top-down memoization with recursion. Consider dp[i] as the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing.

Define dp[i] as the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing. For each element in the array, consider two options: either include it in the increasing subsequence and move all previous elements up by one, or start a new increasing subsequence from this point.

Develop a hybrid approach combining top-down recursion with memoization to efficiently calculate the minimum number of operations.

To improve the plan, consider using bottom-up dynamic programming instead of top-down. This can be done by initializing dp[] array and then filling it in a bottom-up manner.

Potential issues with the plan include:
- It may not correctly handle edge cases such as when all elements are already increasing or when there is only one element.
- The plan does not specify how to handle duplicate values.

Updated Plan:
1. Initialize an array of size N+1, dp[], where dp[i] will store the minimum number of operations needed to make subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing.
2. Iterate from i=1 to N and for each index i, consider two options: either include element Ai in the increasing subsequence or start a new increasing subsequence from this point.
3. For each option, calculate the minimum number of operations needed by recursively calling dp[] function with updated values.
4. Use memoization to store and reuse previously calculated results.
5. Finally, return dp[N] which stores the minimum number of operations needed to make array A strictly increasing.
