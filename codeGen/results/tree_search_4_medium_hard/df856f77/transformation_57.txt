===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using tabulation by constructing the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] where j is a possible value for the (i+1)th element, and dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarray A[0..i] with A[i+1]=j strictly increasing.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k]+1 if j>A[k] else 0 for k in range(1,A[i]))
This update rule is correct because it considers all possible values of the previous element that are less than j, and then adds 1 to their corresponding minimum number of operations.

To further optimize this solution, we can use a dictionary memo where memo[j] is the minimum number of operations to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing and ending with value j. This allows us to avoid recalculating the same values multiple times.

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][A[i]] + 1 if A[i]>A[i-1] else memo[j]
memo[j] = min(dp[i-1][k]+1 for k in range(1,j))

The base case is when i=0, where the number of operations is always 0.

dp[0][j] = 0
