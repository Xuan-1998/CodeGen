===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution is to use dynamic programming with bottom-up memoization and iteration.

Consider dp[i] as the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing, given that all previous elements are in their correct position.

Define dp[i] as the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing. For each element in the array, consider two options: either include it in the increasing subsequence and move all previous elements up by one, or start a new increasing subsequence from this point.

Implement memoization with iteration, storing and reusing results for overlapping subproblems. Initialize dp[0] to 0, as there are no operations needed to make an empty array strictly increasing.

Iterate through the array, updating dp[i] based on the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarrays A[0..i-1] and A[0..i] strictly increasing.

Finally, return dp[N-1], which represents the minimum number of operations needed to make the entire array strictly increasing.
