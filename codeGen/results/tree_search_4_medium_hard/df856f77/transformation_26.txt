===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution is to use dynamic programming with bottom-up tabulation.

Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of operations required to make the array strictly increasing up to index i.

dp[i] = min(dp[j] + (A[j] != A[i]) ? 1 : 0) for j from 0 to i-1

The base case is when i=0, in which case dp[0]=0 since we don't need any operations to make the array strictly increasing.

To find the minimum number of operations required to make the array strictly increasing up to index N, return dp[N].
