===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution is to use dynamic programming with bottom-up approach and a 2D table.

Define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing, considering the last element is A[j].
dp[i][j] = 
    if j == i:
        return 0 (base case: single element)
    else:
        min(dp[k][j-1] for k in range(j) if A[k] <= A[j]) + 
        (A[j] - A[prev_index]) if prev_index != -1 else 0
prev_index = max(k for k in range(j) if A[k] <= A[j])

The final answer is the minimum value of dp[i][i] for all i.
Implementing this plan using a 2D table and iterating through each element to fill up the table, then reading off the last row as the solution.
