===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using tabulation by constructing the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array.

Let the state expression be dp[i] representing the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing.

dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing. 
dp[i] can be calculated as follows: dp[i] = min(dp[j] + |A[i] - A[j]| for j in range(0, i)) where j is the previous strictly increasing index.

Implement memoization using a recursive function that returns the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing.

Consider initializing dp[0] = 0 and then filling up the dp array iteratively by iterating over each element in the array. This way, you can avoid calculating the same subproblems multiple times.

The plan seems correct, but it might be more efficient to implement memoization using a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming instead of a recursive function.

Edge cases should include handling the case where N is 1 (in which case dp[i] = 0 for all i), as well as handling the case where A[0] > A[1].

Here's an updated version of the plan:
