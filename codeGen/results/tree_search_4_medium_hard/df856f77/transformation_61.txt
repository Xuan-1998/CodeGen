===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using tabulation by constructing the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array.

Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing, assuming that A[i] is in its optimal position.

dp[i] could be the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing, considering all possible insertions or deletions of numbers up to i.

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by iterating over the array from left to right and computing dp[i] as the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing, given that we know the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i-1] strictly increasing.

Define a variable prev_value to keep track of the previous value in the array, and initialize it to -âˆž. Then, for each element in the array, calculate dp[i] as the minimum number of operations required to insert or delete elements up to i so that A[0..i] is strictly increasing.

Update prev_value to the current element after calculating dp[i].

Finally, return dp[N-1], which represents the minimum number of operations required to make the entire array strictly increasing.
