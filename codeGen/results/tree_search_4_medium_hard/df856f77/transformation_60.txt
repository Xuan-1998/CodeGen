===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using tabulation by constructing the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array.
Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing, assuming that A[i] is in its optimal position.
dp[i] could be the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing, considering all possible insertions or deletions of numbers up to i.

To construct dp[i], consider the following steps:
1. If A[i-1] < A[i], then no operation is needed for this prefix.
2. Otherwise, consider the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i-1] strictly increasing (dp[i-1]).
3. Add the minimum number of operations required to move A[i-1] to its optimal position in relation to A[i].
4. Update dp[i] as the minimum of these two values.

Implement memoization by storing the results of expensive function calls (e.g., the minimum number of operations required for a given prefix) in a dictionary-like data structure.
Store previous computed values of dp[i] to avoid redundant computation.
