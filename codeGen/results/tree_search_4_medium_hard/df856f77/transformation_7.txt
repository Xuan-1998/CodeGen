===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming where we fill up the dp table in a bottom-up manner, starting from the smallest subproblems.

dp[i][j] will represent the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i, considering that A[i-1] <= j.

A state can be a pair (i, j) where i is the current index and j is the target value. The next state will be (i+1, k) where k is either j+1 or the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i-1.

To avoid redundant computations when exploring the same state multiple times, we can implement memoization using a dictionary to store previously computed subproblems' solutions.

We need to add some base cases for dp[0][j] (when i is 0) and handle edge cases where j is greater than A[i]. For these edge cases, we consider that there are no operations needed as the array is already strictly increasing up to index i.

Finally, we return dp[N-1][-1] which represents the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing from the start.
