===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution is to use top-down memoization with recursion and backtracking, identifying the longest increasing subsequence first.

Define dp[i] as the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing.

dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1 for j in range(i) if A[j] <= A[i])

Apply a greedy algorithm by iterating through the array and updating the minimum number of operations needed at each step:

for i in range(N):
    dp[i] = min((j-1) + (A[i]-A[j]) for j in range(i) if A[j] <= A[i])
return max(dp)
