===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using tabulation by constructing the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array.

Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing, assuming that A[i] is in its optimal position.
Let dp[i] be the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing; then transition occurs when A[i-1] > A[i], requiring a single operation to move A[i-1] down.

Update dp[i] based on the optimal position of A[i-1]: if A[i-1] > A[i], set dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1 (since we need to adjust A[i-1]), otherwise, dp[i] remains unchanged.
Initialize dp[0] = 0.

Use a bottom-up approach with a single loop from i=1 to n-1: iterate through the array and update dp[i] based on the previous element's optimal position.

At each step, consider the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing by taking into account the transition at index i.
The final result will be stored in dp[n-1], representing the minimum number of operations required to make the entire array strictly increasing.
