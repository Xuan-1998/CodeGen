===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with bottom-up tabulation.

Let dp[i] be the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing. For each element in the array, consider two options: either include it in the increasing subsequence and move all previous elements up by one, or start a new increasing subsequence from this point.

The base case is dp[0] = 0, as there are no operations needed for an empty array.

For i > 0, calculate dp[i] based on previously computed cells. Consider two options:

* Option 1: Include A[i] in the increasing subsequence and move all previous elements up by one. This would require dp[i-1] + (A[i] - A[i-1]) operations.
* Option 2: Start a new increasing subsequence from this point. This would require dp[0] + i operations.

Choose the option with the minimum number of operations, and update dp[i] accordingly.

Finally, return dp[N-1], which represents the minimum number of operations needed to make the entire array strictly increasing.
