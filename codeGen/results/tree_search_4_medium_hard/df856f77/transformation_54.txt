===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using tabulation by constructing the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array.

Let the state expression be dp[i] representing the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing.

dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing. dp[i] can be calculated as follows:

dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + 1 for j in range(1, i+1) and A[j] > A[j-1]) where j is the previous strictly increasing index.

Create a table dp of size N+1 and initialize dp[0] to 0. Iterate over the array, for each element at index i:

for i in range(N):
    prev_increasing_index = 0
    min_ops = float('inf')
    for j in range(1, i+1):
        if A[j] > A[j-1]:
            prev_increasing_index = j
            min_ops = min(min_ops, dp[prev_increasing_index-1] + (i - prev_increasing_index))
    dp[i] = min_ops

The minimum number of operations required to make the entire array strictly increasing is stored in dp[N-1].
