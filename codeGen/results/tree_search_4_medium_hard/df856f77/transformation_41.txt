The plan is almost correct, but there's a slight misunderstanding about how to approach this problem.

Here's an updated and corrected version:

===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider dp[i] as the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing. We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Here's the idea:
- Initialize dp array with infinity for all elements.
- For each element in the array, find the maximum index j such that A[j] < A[i].
- Then calculate dp[i] = 1 + dp[j] (since we need to make A[i] greater than A[j]).

Apply top-down memoization with recursion and backtracking to find the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing.
===END PLAN===
