===BEGIN PLAN===
Let's break down the plan step by step:

Consider using tabulation by constructing the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array.
This is a good approach because we can reuse previously computed values to avoid redundant calculations.

Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing, assuming that A[i] is in its optimal position.
We want to minimize the maximum value in the prefix so that we can apply as few operations as possible. This assumption will help us avoid overcounting.

dp[i] is the minimum number of operations required to make the prefix A[0..i] strictly increasing, by trying to minimize the maximum value in the prefix
By considering dp[i-1], we can reduce the number of operations needed to make the prefix strictly increasing. We'll update dp[i] based on this.

Use memoization by defining a recursive function that calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the first i+1 elements strictly increasing.
This will help us avoid redundant calculations and reduce the time complexity.
