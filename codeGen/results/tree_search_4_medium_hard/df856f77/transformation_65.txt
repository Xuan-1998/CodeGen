===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using tabulation by constructing the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array.

Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing, assuming that A[i] is in its optimal position.
Let dp[i] be the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing; then transition occurs when A[i-1] > A[i], requiring a single operation to move A[i-1] down.

Consider initializing dp[0] as 0, since there are no operations required to make the subarray A[0..0] strictly increasing.
Let's also initialize dp[1] as 0, since A[0] is already in its optimal position.

For i > 1:
    If A[i-1] <= A[i], then the transition from A[i-1] to A[i] does not require any operations; in this case, we can just copy the value of dp[i-1] and increment it by 0.
    Else (A[i-1] > A[i]), a single operation is required to move A[i-1] down; in this case, we add 1 to the value of dp[i-1].

Finally, return dp[N-1], which represents the minimum number of operations required to make the entire array strictly increasing.
