===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution is to use dynamic programming with bottom-up memoization and iteration.
Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of operations required to make the array strictly increasing up to index i.
dp[0] = 0
For each i from 1 to N:
    dp[i] = dp[i-1]
    For each j from 0 to i-1:
        if A[j] < A[i]:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
Using a list-based memoization approach by storing previously computed values.
Return dp[N] as the minimum number of operations required to make the array strictly increasing.
