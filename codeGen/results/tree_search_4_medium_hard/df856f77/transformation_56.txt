===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using tabulation by constructing the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] where j is a possible value for the (i+1)th element, and dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarray A[0..i] with A[i+1]=j strictly increasing.

To initialize the 2D array dp, set dp[0][A[0]] = 0, since there's no need for operations when there's only one element in the array.

For i > 0 and j >= A[i], dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][k] + 1 where k is the minimum value that can be used to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing with A[i+1]=j. This is because we need to change all elements in the range [A[i-1]+1, j-1] to j or greater.

For i > 0 and j < A[i], dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][A[i]] + 1 if A[i]>A[i-1] else 0. This is because we need to change the value at index i to be strictly less than A[i+1]=j, or keep it unchanged.

Finally, return dp[N-2][max(A[0..N-1])] as the minimum number of operations required to make the array strictly increasing.
