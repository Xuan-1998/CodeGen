===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach where we fill up the dp table in a bottom-up manner, starting from the smallest subproblems.
state dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i with value j.

dp[i][j] = min(j + sum(dp[k-1][k] for k in range(1, j) if A[k-1] < A[k]), dp[i-1][j]) if i > 0, else j;

Use a 2D dynamic programming table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to index i with value j.

The base case is when i == 0. In this case, we simply return j as the minimum number of operations.
For the recursive case, we consider two possibilities: either we keep the current value j or we change it to a smaller value. The minimum number of operations needed in both cases is calculated and the minimum is taken.

This plan correctly addresses the problem by considering all possible subproblems and solving them recursively. It also includes edge cases such as when i == 0.
