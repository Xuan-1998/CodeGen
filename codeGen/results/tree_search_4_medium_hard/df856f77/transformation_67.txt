===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using tabulation by constructing the minimum number of operations required for each prefix of the array.
Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing, assuming that A[i] is in its optimal position.
The base case is when i = 1, where no operation is needed.

For i > 1, consider two cases:
- Case 1: A[i] >= A[i-1], which means the current element can be placed at its original position. In this case, the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing is dp[i-1].
- Case 2: A[i] < A[i-1], which means we need to move the previous element down to its correct position. This requires one operation.

The transition occurs when A[i-1] > A[i], requiring a single operation to move A[i-1] down.
Let dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], 1 + dp[j]), where j is the maximum index such that A[j] <= A[i].
Use a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray A[0..i] strictly increasing, assuming that A[j] is in its optimal position.
The final answer is dp[n-1].
