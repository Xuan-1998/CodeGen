===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider each number in the array as a 'pivot'. For each pivot, calculate its greatest common divisor (GCD) with all other numbers in the array. This will create new subproblems that can be solved recursively or iteratively.

Define state as the maximum beauty that can be achieved by performing operations on a subarray ending at index i, and the base case is when the subarray has only one element, in which case the beauty is equal to the single element itself.

State could be the maximum beauty that can be achieved by performing operations on a subarray of length i, considering the last number in the subarray as the current pivot.

To solve this problem efficiently, implement memoization using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems as they are solved. Use the stored results to avoid recomputing the same subproblem multiple times.

The plan does not explicitly consider edge cases such as when the array is empty or when there are no bad prime numbers. However, these edge cases can be handled by returning 0 for an empty array and considering all elements in the array if there are no bad prime numbers.

To improve this plan, consider using a more efficient algorithm to calculate the GCDs between numbers. This could involve pre-computing the prime factorizations of the numbers and then calculating the GCDs based on these factorizations.

Here is the updated version:
