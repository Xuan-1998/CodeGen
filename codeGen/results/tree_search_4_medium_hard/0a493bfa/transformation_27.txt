===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify a recursive relationship between the maximum beauty of an array and its subarrays. Define a state expression based on the subarrays' lengths and their corresponding maximum beauties. Use bottom-up approach with tabulation to fill up a 2D table, where each cell represents the maximum beauty of a subarray.

Consider the maximum beauty of a subarray [a1, ..., an] as a function of its two halves, [a1, ..., ak] and [ak+1, ..., an]. The maximum beauty is determined by the maximum beauties of these two halves and the number of operations performed to combine them. This can be represented as:

max_beauty(n, prev_operations) = max( 
    f(max_beauty(k, 0)) + n - k - prev_operations, 
    max_beauty(n-k-1, 1)
)

where f(x) is defined by the problem statement.

The state could be represented by a tuple (n, prev_operations) where n is the subarray's length and prev_operations is the number of operations performed to combine the previous two halves.

Tabulate maximum beauties in a list where each element represents the maximum beauty of a subarray. This can be done using dynamic programming, initializing the table with base cases for arrays of lengths 1 and 0, then filling up the table based on the recursive relationship above.
