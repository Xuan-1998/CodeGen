===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify a recursive relationship between the maximum beauty of an array and its subarrays. Define a state expression based on the subarrays' lengths and their corresponding maximum beauties. 

Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum beauty of the array after performing an arbitrary number of operations, given that the current operation is considering the two halves [i...j]. The base case would be when i = j, in which case we simply consider the original array.

The transition relationship can be defined as follows:
- For each bad prime number p, check if p is present in the current subarray [i...j].
    * If p is not present, then the maximum beauty of this subarray would be the sum of the maximum beauties of its two halves.
    * If p is present, then we can consider one of three cases:
        1. The first half contains p and does not contain any other bad primes. In this case, the maximum beauty would be the maximum beauty of the right half (j to n) minus j.
        2. The second half contains p and does not contain any other bad primes. In this case, the maximum beauty would be the maximum beauty of the left half (1 to i) plus i.
        3. Both halves contain p or do not contain p at all. In this case, we can consider both options above and take the maximum.

Use bottom-up approach with tabulation to fill up a 2D table, where each cell represents the maximum beauty of a subarray. Start from the base cases (i = j) and build up to larger values of i and j.
