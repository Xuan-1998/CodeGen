===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider each number in the array as a 'pivot'. For each pivot, calculate its greatest common divisor (GCD) with all other numbers in the array. This will create new subproblems that can be solved recursively or iteratively.

The base case would be when the array contains only one element, in which case the beauty is 0.

We use dynamic programming to fill up the table:
Let's define dp[i][j] as the maximum beauty we can get after processing the first i pivots and the last j numbers. We need to find the maximum value of dp[n][m], where n is the length of the array and m is the number of bad prime numbers.

Formulate state as an array of tuples, where each tuple represents a pivot and its corresponding beauty; transition by updating the beauty of adjacent pivots based on their GCDs.
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k-1] + min(a[i], gcd(a[i], a[k])) for k in range(1, i+1)) if j == 0
else dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k-1] - min(b[j-1], gcd(a[i], a[k])) for k in range(1, i+1))

Memoization using recursion with memoized dictionary to store subproblems.

This plan covers all possible edge cases: the array can be empty or contain only one element, and the number of bad prime numbers can be 0.
