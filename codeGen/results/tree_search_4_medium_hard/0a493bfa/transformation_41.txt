===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider each number in the array as a 'pivot'. For each pivot, calculate its greatest common divisor (GCD) with all other numbers in the array. This will create new subproblems that can be solved recursively or iteratively.

Formulate state as an array of tuples, where each tuple represents a pivot and its corresponding beauty; transition by updating the beauty of adjacent pivots based on their GCDs.

Tabulation using a 1D array to store the maximum beauty at each pivot.

For each pivot, iterate through all previous pivots, calculate the GCD with the current pivot, and update the beauty of the current pivot as the maximum between its initial beauty and the beauty of the previous pivot minus the GCD times the number of elements in the range [1, GCD].

Tabulate the maximum beauty for each pivot.

To maximize the beauty of the array, iterate through all pivots, and return the maximum beauty at any pivot.

The plan correctly identifies the main steps to solve the problem: calculating GCDs, updating beauty values, and tabulating results. However, it does not explicitly consider the edge cases where m is 0 or n is 1.

To maximize the beauty of the array, iterate through all pivots, consider edge cases where m is 0 or n is 1, and return the maximum beauty at any pivot.

If m is 0, return the sum of all elements in the array. If n is 1, return 0 as there are no more operations to perform.
