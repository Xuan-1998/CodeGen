===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider each number in the array as a 'pivot'. For each pivot, calculate its greatest common divisor (GCD) with all other numbers in the array. This will create new subproblems that can be solved recursively or iteratively.

State: for each number i in the array, define a tuple (i, beauty) where beauty is the maximum beauty that can be achieved after applying all possible operations starting from number i.

The state could be a combination of the current pivot and its GCD with other pivots in the array, along with their respective beauty values.

Consider using dynamic programming by creating a 2D table dp where each cell (i, j) represents the maximum beauty that can be achieved after applying all possible operations starting from number i and considering only numbers up to j.

For each cell (i, j), calculate the GCD of the current pivot i with all numbers in [1, j]. For each prime p in [b1, b2, ..., bm], check if p is a good prime or not. If it's a good prime, add the beauty of i to dp[i-1][j-1] and update the cell. If it's not a good prime, subtract the beauty of i from dp[i-1][j-1] and update the cell.

Finally, return the value in the bottom-right corner of the table, which represents the maximum beauty that can be achieved after applying all possible operations on the entire array.
