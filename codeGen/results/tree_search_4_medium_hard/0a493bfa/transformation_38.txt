===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider each number in the array as a 'pivot'. For each pivot, calculate its greatest common divisor (GCD) with all other numbers in the array. This will create new subproblems that can be solved recursively or iteratively.

The base case would be when the array contains only one element, in which case the beauty is 0.

Then we use dynamic programming to fill up the table:

Let dp[i] be the maximum beauty of the array after performing operations on a[1], ..., a[i]. 

For each i from 2 to n:
    For each j from 1 to i-1:
        Calculate the GCD of a[j] and all numbers in [j+1, i]
        Let s be the sum of these GCDs
        Update dp[i] = max(dp[i], f(s) + dp[j-1])

The final answer would be dp[n]
