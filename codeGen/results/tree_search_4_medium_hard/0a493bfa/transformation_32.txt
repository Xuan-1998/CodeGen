===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider each number in the array as a 'pivot'. For each pivot, calculate its greatest common divisor (GCD) with all other numbers in the array. This will create new subproblems that can be solved recursively or iteratively.

State: for each number i in the array, define a tuple (i, beauty) where beauty is the maximum beauty that can be achieved after applying all possible operations starting from number i.
The state could be a combination of the current pivot and its GCD with other pivots in the array, along with their respective beauty values.

To avoid redundant calculations, implement memoization by defining a recursive function and storing intermediate results in a dictionary. This will help to improve the plan's efficiency.

Potential issues:
* The plan does not specify how to handle bad prime numbers.
* It doesn't consider the effect of applying multiple operations on the same number.

Edge cases:
* If all numbers in the array are bad prime numbers, return 0 as there is no way to improve the beauty.
* If the array contains only one element, its beauty is 0 (no changes can be made).

To address these issues and edge cases, consider the following updates:

1. Handle bad prime numbers by subtracting their values from the beauty when they are encountered during the recursive function.

2. Implement a while loop to apply multiple operations on the same number until no more improvements can be made.

3. Initialize the memo dictionary with base cases (i.e., for i = 0, return 0) and handle edge cases as mentioned above.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
