===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem.

Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum beauty that can be achieved from array indices i to j (inclusive). We need to find dp[0][n-1].

Define a state expression: (i, j, prev_operations) where i and j are the starting and ending indices of the subarray, and prev_operations is the number of operations performed to combine the previous two halves.

The maximum beauty of an array depends on the maximum beauties of its two halves, and the number of operations performed to combine these two halves. Let's consider the following cases:

- If j - i + 1 is odd, then we can choose one operation or no operation at all.
- If j - i + 1 is even, then we have more flexibility in choosing operations.

To fill up the dp table, do the following for each cell (i, j):
    - Calculate the maximum beauty of the current subarray by considering all possible choices for the number of operations performed to combine its two halves.
    - For each possible choice, recursively calculate the maximum beauties of the left and right halves, and add the appropriate value depending on whether the operation is good or bad.

Apply memoization using a dictionary to store computed values for faster lookups.

Finally, return dp[0][n-1] as the maximum beauty that can be achieved from the entire array.
