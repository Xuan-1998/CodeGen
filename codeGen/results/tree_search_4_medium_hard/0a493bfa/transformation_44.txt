===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider each number in the array as a 'pivot'. For each pivot, calculate its greatest common divisor (GCD) with all other numbers in the array. This will create new subproblems that can be solved recursively or iteratively.

Define state as the maximum beauty that can be achieved by performing operations on a subarray ending at index i, and the base case is when the subarray has only one element, in which case the beauty is equal to the single element itself.

State could be the maximum beauty that can be achieved by performing operations on a subarray of length i, considering the last number in the subarray as the current pivot. A recursive approach where each function call solves a subproblem and stores the result in a memoization table to avoid redundant computation.

To improve the plan, consider maintaining an additional state for the maximum beauty that can be achieved by performing operations on a subarray of length i-1, considering the last number in the subarray as the current pivot. This will help to reduce the number of recursive calls and make the solution more efficient.

The plan seems correct, but it's essential to consider edge cases, such as when the array contains only one element or all elements are the same. In these cases, the maximum beauty is simply the single element itself.
