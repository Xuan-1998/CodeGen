1. Initialize an empty dictionary dp to store the intermediate results and their corresponding beauty values.

2. Define a function gcd(a, b) that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers a and b using the Euclidean algorithm.

3. Iterate over each number i in the array:
    - For each number i, calculate its GCD with all other numbers j in the array where 1 <= j <= n and j != i.
    - Store the result (i, beauty) in the dictionary dp where beauty is the maximum beauty that can be achieved after applying all possible operations starting from number i.

4. The final answer will be stored in dp[0] since we are considering each number as a 'pivot'.

5. To optimize the calculation process and reduce redundant calculations, consider using memoization techniques like caching or storing intermediate results to avoid recalculating the same GCD values multiple times.

6. When calculating the GCD of two numbers, use the properties of GCDs (associative property) to break down the problem into smaller subproblems that have already been solved and stored in the dp dictionary.
