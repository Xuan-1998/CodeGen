===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider each number in the array as a 'pivot'. For each pivot, calculate its greatest common divisor (GCD) with all other numbers in the array. This will create new subproblems that can be solved recursively or iteratively.

Define state as the maximum beauty that can be achieved by performing operations on a subarray ending at index i, and the base case is when the subarray has only one element, in which case the beauty is equal to the single element itself.

State could be the tuple (i, bad_primes, max_beauty), where i is the current index, bad_primes is the set of bad prime numbers seen so far, and max_beauty is the maximum beauty achievable at this point. Transition relationship could involve updating the set of bad primes and calculating the new GCD for each pivot.

Maintain a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the maximum beauty that can be achieved by performing operations on a subarray from index i to j.
