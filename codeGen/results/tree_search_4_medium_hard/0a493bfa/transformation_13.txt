===BEGIN PLAN===
Find overlapping subproblems in the array, where each subproblem is defined by a subset of numbers and a set of bad prime numbers. 
Use top-down approach with memoization to solve this problem.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[k][l-1] * f(gcd(...))) for k from 0 to i and l from j down to 0

View the problem as a function that takes a set of numbers and returns its beauty. 
Break down this function into smaller functions, each operating on a subset of the input set.

dp[i][j] = dp[k][l-1] * f(gcd(a[k], ..., a[j])) + f(sum(a[k+1:i+1]))
for k from 0 to i and l from j down to 0

Apply memoization to store previously computed values in order to avoid redundant computations and optimize the solution.

Initialize dp with -inf. For each number in the array, update dp[i][j] for all possible subsets ending at j.

Edge cases:
- If m=0 (no bad prime numbers), return sum(a) because all operations will be applied.
- If n=1 (only one number), return a[0] as there is only one operation to apply.
