===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider each number in the array as a 'pivot'. For each pivot, calculate its greatest common divisor (GCD) with all other numbers in the array. This will create new subproblems that can be solved recursively or iteratively.

State: for each number i in the array, define a tuple (i, beauty) where beauty is the maximum beauty that can be achieved after applying all possible operations starting from number i.

State could represent the number of operations applied so far, and the total beauty gained until that point.

To implement a 2D table where each cell represents the maximum beauty that can be achieved after applying all possible operations starting from each number in the array.

For the base case, when the array has only one element, set its beauty to 0. This is because no operation can be applied to it.

To fill up the 2D table, iterate through the array and for each pivot, calculate its GCD with all other numbers in the array. Then recursively or iteratively apply operations based on the GCDs until no more operations can be applied. The maximum beauty achieved during this process is stored in the cell representing that pivot.

To improve the plan, consider using a memoization technique to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

Potential issues with the plan include:

* Edge cases: What happens when the array has only one element? Should we add a special case for this?
* Time complexity: Will the recursive or iterative approach be efficient enough?
