===BEGIN PLAN===
Find overlapping subproblems in the array, where each subproblem is defined by a subset of numbers and a set of bad prime numbers. Use top-down approach with memoization to solve this problem.

dp[i][j] = max( dp[k][l-1] * f(gcd(...)) ) for k from 0 to i and l from j down to 0

Consider the array as a tree, where each node is a subset of numbers and each edge represents an operation (replacing elements with their GCD). Define states based on nodes in the tree and formulate transition relationships between them.

Create a recursive function without memoization, but use a pruning strategy to reduce the number of unnecessary computations. Consider using bitwise operations to improve performance.

For edge cases, consider handling the base case where i or j is 0. Also, consider special cases for when the bad prime numbers set is empty or contains only one element.
