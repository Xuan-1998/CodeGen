===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider each number in the array as a 'pivot'. For each pivot, calculate its greatest common divisor (GCD) with all other numbers in the array. This will create new subproblems that can be solved recursively or iteratively.

Define state as the tuple (i, max_beauty), where i is the current index and max_beauty is the maximum beauty achievable at this point. The base case is when the subarray has only one element, in which case the beauty is equal to the single element itself.

Define dp[i] as the maximum beauty achievable by performing operations on a subarray ending at index i. Transition relationship could be updated by considering all previous pivots and their corresponding GCDs.

To avoid redundant calculations, use a 1D array to store the dynamic programming state. Initialize dp[0] = 0, and for each pivot from 1 to n, calculate its GCD with the rest of the array (excluding itself). If the GCD is good (not in the set of bad prime numbers), update dp[i] as the maximum of the current beauty and f(dp[i-1]) + a[i]. Otherwise, update dp[i] as the minimum of the current beauty and f(dp[i-1]) - a[i].

Finally, return dp[n-1] as the maximum beauty achievable by performing operations on the entire array.
