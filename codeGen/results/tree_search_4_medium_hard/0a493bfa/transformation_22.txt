==BEGIN PLAN==
Identify a recursive relationship between the maximum beauty of an array and its subarrays. Define a state expression based on the subarrays' lengths and their corresponding maximum beauties. Use bottom-up approach with tabulation to fill up a 2D table, where each cell represents the maximum beauty of a subarray.

The maximum beauty of an array depends on the maximum beauties of its two halves, and the number of operations performed to combine these two halves.

Define the state as the maximum beauty of the array after performing an arbitrary number of operations, based on the lengths of its two halves. The transition relationship would involve calculating the maximum beauty for each half and combining them according to the problem's rules.

Create a table with dimensions n+1 by m+1, where n is the length of the array and m is the number of bad prime numbers. Initialize each cell to store the maximum beauty for that subarray.
