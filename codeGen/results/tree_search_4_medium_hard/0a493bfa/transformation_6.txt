===BEGIN PLAN===
Find overlapping subproblems in the array, where each subproblem is defined by a subset of numbers and a set of bad prime numbers. Use top-down approach with memoization to solve this problem.

dp[i][j] = max( beauty(a[:i], b[:j]) + f(gcd(...)) ) for all possible subsets of a[:i] and b[:j]

Represent each state as a pair (i, j), where i is the index of the current element in the array and j is the index of the current bad prime number. Transition from state (i-1, j) to state (i, j+1) by considering whether or not the current element should be included in the subset.

Consider implementing a 2D DP table with dimensions n x m where dp[i][j] represents the maximum beauty of the array up to index i and considering the first j bad prime numbers.

The plan correctly identifies overlapping subproblems, which is crucial for dynamic programming. However, it does not specify how to calculate the beauty of a subset and the greatest common divisor (gcd).

To improve the plan, consider adding more details on how to calculate these values. Also, provide a base case for the dynamic programming solution.

One potential issue with the plan is that it might be slow due to the exponential growth of possible subsets in the array.

The plan does not explicitly mention edge cases; however, it can be improved by considering what to do when i or j equals 0. For example, if i equals 0, then the current element should not be included in the subset.

Here is an updated version of the plan:
