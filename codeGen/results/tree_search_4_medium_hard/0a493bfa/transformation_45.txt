===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider each number in the array as a 'pivot'. For each pivot, calculate its greatest common divisor (GCD) with all other numbers in the array. This will create new subproblems that can be solved recursively or iteratively.

Define state as the tuple (i, max_beauty), where i is the current index and max_beauty is the maximum beauty achievable at this point. The base case is when the subarray has only one element, in which case the beauty is equal to the single element itself.

To improve the plan, consider using a 2D array dp[i][j] to store the dynamic programming state, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum beauty achievable by performing operations on a subarray ending at index i and starting from index j. Initialize dp[0][0] as the first element of the array.

The transition relationship can be updated by considering all previous pivots and their corresponding GCDs. For each pivot, calculate the new beauty by taking the maximum of the current beauty and the beauty achievable after performing operations on the subarray ending at the current pivot index. This will ensure that the optimal sequence of operations is considered.

To handle edge cases, consider the following:

* When the array has only one element, the maximum beauty is equal to the single element itself.
* When the array has two elements, the maximum beauty is equal to the minimum of the two elements.
* When the array has more than two elements, initialize dp[i][0] as the first element of the array and dp[0][j] as the j-th element of the array.

Here's the updated plan:
