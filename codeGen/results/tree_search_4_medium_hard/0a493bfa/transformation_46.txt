===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider each number in the array as a 'pivot'. For each pivot, calculate its greatest common divisor (GCD) with all other numbers in the array. This will create new subproblems that can be solved recursively or iteratively.

Define state as the tuple (i, max_beauty), where i is the current index and max_beauty is the maximum beauty achievable at this point. The base case is when the subarray has only one element, in which case the beauty is equal to the single element itself.

Transition relationship: For each pivot, update the state by considering all previous pivots and their corresponding GCDs. If a good prime number (i.e., not in the set of bad primes) is encountered, apply the operation f(s) = f(s/p) + s. Otherwise, apply the operation f(s) = f(s/p) - s.

Implement memoization using a dictionary where the key is the tuple (i, max_beauty) and the value is the corresponding maximum beauty. This will ensure that subproblems are not solved multiple times, reducing the time complexity of the solution.

To improve the plan, consider pre-computing the GCDs of all pairs of numbers in the array and storing them in a 2D table for efficient lookups during the dynamic programming process.

Potential issues with the plan include:

* Edge cases: Ensure that the plan handles edge cases such as an empty array or arrays with only one element.
* Incorrect calculation of GCDs: Double-check the implementation of the GCD function to ensure it is correct and efficient.
* Inefficient memoization: Verify that the memoization dictionary is implemented correctly and efficiently to reduce the time complexity of the solution.
