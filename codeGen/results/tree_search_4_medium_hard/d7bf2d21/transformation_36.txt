===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem can be solved by tabulating the bottom-up approach, where you fill up an array with the values of longest increasing subsequence and then count the number of maximum length subsequences.

dp[i] = max(dp[j] + 1 for j in range(i) if arr[j] < arr[i]), where i is the index of the array element

Use a bottom-up approach where you iterate through the array from left to right, updating the dynamic programming table at each step.

Initialize dp with all values set to 1, because an individual element is always an increasing subsequence of length 1.

As you iterate through the array, for each element, update its value in dp based on the maximum length of increasing subsequences ending at previous elements that are smaller than the current element.

Finally, count the number of occurrences of the maximum length found in dp and return it as the result.
