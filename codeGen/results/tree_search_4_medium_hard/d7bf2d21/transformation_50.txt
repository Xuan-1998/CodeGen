===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem can be solved by tabulating the bottom-up approach, where you fill up an array with the values of longest increasing subsequence and then count the number of maximum length subsequences
dp = [0] * len(array)  # Initialize a dynamic programming table with zeros
for i in range(len(array)):
    max_length = 0
    for j in range(i):
        if array[j] < array[i]:
            max_length = max(max_length, dp[j]) + 1
    dp[i] = max_length

max_length = max(dp)  # Find the maximum length of increasing subsequences
count = sum(1 for x in dp if x == max_length)  # Count the number of longest increasing subsequences
