===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem can be solved by tabulating the bottom-up approach, where you fill up an array with the values of longest increasing subsequences and then count the number of maximum length subsequences.

dp[i] = len([j for j in range(i) if arr[j] < arr[i]]) + 1, where i is the index of the array element

Explore the idea of keeping track of the last element in a sequence and using it to determine whether a new sequence can be formed.

Memoizing the maximum length of increasing subsequences as we go

Correctly identify edge cases: 
- Handle the case when the input array is empty
- Handle the case when the input array has only one element

Count the number of longest increasing subsequences and return it
