===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming with memoization, where you iteratively build up the solution from scratch.

DP[i]: number of longest increasing subsequences ending at index i
Define a state as a tuple (i, prev), where i is the current index and prev is the previous element in the subsequence, then transition to the next state by considering all possible next elements that are greater than prev.
Memoization-based Dynamic Programming: Define a dictionary dp where the key is the current index i and value is the number of longest increasing subsequences ending at that index. Use this dictionary to store previously computed results.

Initialization: Set dp[0] = 1, since the longest increasing subsequence ending at the first element is always of length 1.
Recurrence relation:
    - For each index i > 0 and previous element prev:
        If the current element is greater than prev, consider all possible subsequences ending at prev and add 1 to their lengths. Store this result in dp[i].
    - Update the number of longest increasing subsequences ending at i by taking the maximum over all previously computed results.

Termination: The answer is simply the value stored in dp[-1], since we are considering all elements in the array.
