===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify a hybrid approach that combines top-down and bottom-up strategies, such as using dynamic programming to precompute the lengths of all possible subsequences and then counting the maximum length subsequences.

The state can be a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index j in the first i elements.

dp[i][j] can be defined as the number of longest increasing subsequences ending at index j that only consider the first i elements.

Use a 2D array to store the lengths of all possible subsequences and update it by comparing each element with its previous ones. Initialize dp[0][i] for all i to 1, since every element in the first subarray is considered as an increasing subsequence of length 1.

For each row i, calculate the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index j by considering only the elements up to that point (i.e., up to index j). This can be done by iterating over all previous elements and checking if they are less than the current element. If so, update dp[i][j] with the maximum of its current value and the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at the previous element.

Finally, count the number of rows where the last column has the maximum value (i.e., the maximum length), which represents the number of longest increasing subsequences in the given array.
