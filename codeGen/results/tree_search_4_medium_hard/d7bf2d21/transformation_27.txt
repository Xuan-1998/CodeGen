===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem can be solved by tabulating the bottom-up approach, where you fill up an array with the values of longest increasing subsequences and then count the number of maximum length subsequences
Let dp[i] denote the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i. Then,
dp[i] = max(dp[j] + 1 for j in range(i) if arr[j] < arr[i])
Use a dynamic programming table to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position in the array
Create an array dp of size n, where n is the length of the input array. Initialize all elements to 1 (base case: single element is an increasing subsequence)
Fill up the dp array by iterating through the array from left to right. For each element i, calculate the maximum length of increasing subsequences ending at previous indices j such that arr[j] < arr[i]. This will give you the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i
Count the number of elements in the dp array that have a maximum value (i.e., the length of the longest increasing subsequences). This will give you the number of longest increasing subsequences
