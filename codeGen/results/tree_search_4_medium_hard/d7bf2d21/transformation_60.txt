===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index j in the first i elements.

1. Initialize dp[][] array where dp[i][j] = 0 for all i and j
2. Traverse the input array from left to right:
    - For each element, iterate through the previous elements (from start to current element):
        * If the current element is greater than the previous element, increment the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at that previous index.
        * Update dp[i][j] with the maximum length found so far.
3. Traverse the input array from right to left:
    - For each element, iterate through the following elements (from end to current element):
        * If the current element is less than or equal to the next element, decrement the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at that next index.
        * Update dp[i][j] with the minimum length found so far.
4. The number of longest increasing subsequences is the sum of all unique values in dp[][] array.
