===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming with tabulation, where you iterate through the array and update a dynamic programming table with values based on previously computed results.

DP[i]: number of longest increasing subsequences ending at index i
 Initialize DP with zeros for all indices
 For each element in the array:
   Update DP[i] to be the maximum value between 
     1. If this is the first element, then it's an increasing subsequence of length 1
     2. The maximum number of longest increasing subsequences ending at previous elements that are smaller than the current element plus one (because we can add the current element to the end)

Determine the maximum number of longest increasing subsequences by finding the maximum value in DP
