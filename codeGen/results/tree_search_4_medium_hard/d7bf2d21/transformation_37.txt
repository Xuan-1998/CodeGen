===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem can be solved by tabulating the bottom-up approach, where you fill up an array with the values of longest increasing subsequence and then count the number of maximum length subsequences
dp[i] = max(dp[j] for j in range(i) if arr[j] < arr[i]) + 1, where i is the index of the array element
Use a 2D table to store the lengths of longest increasing subsequences for each prefix of the array.
For each element in the array:
	* Initialize dp[i] = 1
	* For each previous element j such that arr[j] < arr[i]:
		+ Update dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
Count the number of maximum length subsequences by counting the occurrences of the maximum value in the dp array
