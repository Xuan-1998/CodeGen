===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming with memoization, where you iteratively build up the solutions by considering all possible subsequences and storing previously computed results in a memo dictionary to avoid redundant computations.

Memo: {i: longest_increasing_subsequence[i]: length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i}
The key insight lies in recognizing that each element can be either part of the longest increasing subsequence or not, so focus on finding the longest increasing subsequences that end at each index i.

Maintain a dictionary memo where memo[i] is the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i. Initialize it with values for indices 0 and 1 as base cases.
Iterate over all elements in the array from index 2 to the end, considering each element as the potential last element of an increasing subsequence.

For each element i, consider two possibilities: either i is part of the longest increasing subsequence ending at some previous index j (memo[j] + 1), or it's not part of any increasing subsequence (0).

Update memo[i] to be the maximum of these two possibilities. If a longer increasing subsequence is found, update the count of longest increasing subsequences accordingly.

Finally, return the total count of longest increasing subsequences.
