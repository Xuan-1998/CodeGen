===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming with memoization, where you iteratively build up the solution from the base cases.

Let DP[i]: number of longest increasing subsequences ending at index i
Initialize an array dp of length n with all elements set to 1 (since each element can be its own LIS)

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i):
        if arr[j] < arr[i]:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
return max(dp)
