===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a top-down approach using dynamic programming with memoization, where you recursively explore all possible subsequences and store previously computed results in a memo dictionary to avoid redundant computations.

Memo: {i: longest_increasing_subsequence[i]: length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i}
View this problem as an instance of the classic problem 'Length of Longest Increasing Subsequence' (LLIS) and leverage existing solutions such as dynamic programming with a 1D array or binary search-based approach.

Memoize the length of longest increasing subsequence ending at each index

For each element in the array:
    - Initialize memo[i] to 1 if the current element is greater than all previous elements
    - Iterate over previous elements and update memo[i] as the maximum between its current value and the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at that previous element plus 1 if the current element is greater

This plan can be improved by:
    - Implementing a more efficient memoization strategy, such as using a Trie or Hash Map to store previously computed results
    - Optimizing the algorithm to avoid redundant computations and reduce time complexity

Potential issues with this plan include:
    - Inefficient use of memory for large arrays
    - High computational complexity if not optimized correctly

This plan does not explicitly handle edge cases, but can be adapted to do so by:
    - Initializing memo dictionary with default values or handling invalid inputs
    - Handling cases where the longest increasing subsequence is of length 1 or more
