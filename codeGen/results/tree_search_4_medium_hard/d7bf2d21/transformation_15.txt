===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming with memoization, where you iteratively build up the solution by considering all possible subsequences and storing previously computed results in a 2D table.

DP[i][j]: length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i with j elements
Define a state DP[i][k] to represent the maximum length of the increasing subsequences ending at index i, where k is the number of elements in this subsequence

Create a 2D table where DP[i][j] represents the maximum length of the increasing subsequences ending at index i with j elements. Initialize all values in the table to -1.

Iterate over the array and for each element:
    For each possible previous element (i-1 to 0):
        If the current element is greater than the previous element, consider the subsequence ending at this element.
        Update DP[i][j] by taking the maximum between its current value and the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at the previous element (DP[i-1][k-1]) + 1.

At the end of the iteration, return the maximum value in the last row of the table, which represents the number of longest increasing subsequences.
