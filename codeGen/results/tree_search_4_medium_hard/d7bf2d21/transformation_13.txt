===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming with memoization, where you iterate over all elements in the array and for each element, calculate the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at that element.

DP[i]: length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i
Initialize DP[0] to 1 (since there's only one way to have an increasing subsequence with one element)

For each element in the array:
    For each previous element j where a[j] < a[i]:
        If the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at j is greater than the current value of DP[i], update DP[i] to the maximum of its current value and DP[j] + 1

Store previously computed results in the memo dictionary to avoid redundant computations and improve performance.

To find the number of longest increasing subsequences, iterate over all elements in the array and for each element, count the number of occurrences where the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at that element is equal to the maximum value of DP. This will give you the total number of longest increasing subsequences.
