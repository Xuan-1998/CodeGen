===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify a hybrid approach that combines top-down and bottom-up strategies, such as using dynamic programming to precompute the lengths of all possible subsequences and then counting the maximum length subsequences.

The state can be a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index j in the first i elements.

dp[i][j] can be defined as the number of longest increasing subsequences ending at index j that only consider the first i elements.

Memoize the longest increasing subsequence length calculation for each prefix of the array and use this memoized information to avoid redundant calculations.

Initialize a 2D array dp with zeros, where dp[i][j] will be used to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index j in the first i elements.

For each element in the array, calculate the longest increasing subsequence ending at that position and update the corresponding dp value.

Then, iterate over the dp values and count the maximum length subsequences.

Finally, return the count of maximum length subsequences as the answer.
