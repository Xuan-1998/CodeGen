===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem can be solved by tabulating the bottom-up approach, where you fill up an array with the values of longest increasing subsequence and then count the number of maximum length subsequences
dp[i] = max(dp[j] + 1 for j in range(i) if arr[j] < arr[i]), where i is the index of the array element
Consider using a dynamic programming table to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position in the array.
Use memoization to store the lengths of longest increasing subsequences seen so far, and then update the memoization table as you iterate through the array

Create an empty dictionary dp to serve as the dynamic programming table
Initialize a variable max_length to 0, which will hold the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequences

Iterate over each element in the given array
For each element i, check if it's greater than any previously seen elements. If so, increment the count for that length
Update dp with the length of the current longest increasing subsequence ending at index i
If a new maximum length is found, update max_length

After iterating over the entire array, return max_length as the number of longest increasing subsequences
