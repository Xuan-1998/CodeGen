===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem can be solved by tabulating the bottom-up approach, where you fill up an array with the values of longest increasing subsequences and then count the number of maximum length subsequences
Create a dynamic programming table dp of size n, where n is the length of the input array
For each element arr[i] in the input array:
    For j from 0 to i-1:
        If arr[j] < arr[i], increment the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index j by 1 and update dp[i]
    Update dp[i] with the maximum value from the previous steps
Count the number of elements in the dynamic programming table that have the same maximum value as the maximum length of any increasing subsequences
