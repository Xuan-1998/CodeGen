===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming with memoization, where you iteratively update a dynamic programming table and store previously computed results in a memo dictionary.

DP[i]: number of longest increasing subsequences ending at index i
Initialize DP to an array of zeros with the same length as the input array.
Create a memo dictionary to store previously computed results, where keys are indices in the array and values are the number of longest increasing subsequences ending at that index.
Iterate through the array:
    For each element at index i, update DP[i] based on the maximum number of longest increasing subsequences ending at previous elements (j) where arr[j] < arr[i].
    Update DP[i] to be the maximum of its current value and 1 + DP[j] for all j such that arr[j] < arr[i].
Update the memo dictionary with the computed values.
Return the maximum value in the DP array as the number of longest increasing subsequences.
