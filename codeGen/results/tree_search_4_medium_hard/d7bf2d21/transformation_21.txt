===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming without memoization, where you iteratively build up solutions from smaller subproblems.
Memo: {i: longest_increasing_subsequence[i]: length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i}
View this problem as an instance of the classic problem 'Length of Longest Increasing Subsequence' (LLIS) and leverage existing solutions such as dynamic programming with a 1D array or binary search-based approach.
Use dynamic programming to compute the length of longest increasing subsequences for all possible subsequences
For each element in the array, iterate through previous elements and find the maximum length of increasing subsequence ending at that previous element that is less than the current element, plus one (for the current element).
Store the result in a 1D array representing the lengths of longest increasing subsequences ending at each index.
Iterate through the array to find the maximum value which represents the number of longest increasing subsequences.
