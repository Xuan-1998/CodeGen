===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify a hybrid approach that combines top-down and bottom-up strategies, such as using dynamic programming to precompute the lengths of all possible subsequences and then counting the maximum length subsequences.
The state can be a 1D array dp[i] where dp[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.
dp[i] can be defined as the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequences ending at index i, considering all possible previous elements.
Implement dynamic programming using the following steps:
    Initialize the dp array with zeros and set dp[0] to 1 (since there is only one way to form an increasing subsequence of length 1).
    For each element in the input array, iterate through the previous elements and update the dp array as follows:
        For each previous element j such that a[i] > a[j], update dp[i] to be the maximum of its current value and dp[j] + 1.
    The number of longest increasing subsequences is then simply the count of values in the dp array that are equal to the maximum length found.
