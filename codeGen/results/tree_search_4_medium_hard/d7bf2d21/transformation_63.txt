===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the state as a dictionary dp[i] = k, where k is the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i in the given array.

Determine whether two elements are part of the same increasing subsequence by comparing their values and store this information in a 1D table seen[i] to represent whether element i has been seen before. Initialize all elements in the seen table as False.

Use a bottom-up approach with a dictionary dp[i] to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i in the given array. Iterate through the array from left to right, and for each element i:

1. If i is not seen yet (seen[i] == False), set its value to 1 and mark it as seen.
2. Otherwise, update dp[i] with the maximum length of increasing subsequences ending at previously seen elements that are smaller than i, plus 1.

Finally, return the maximum length of all values in the dp dictionary, which represents the number of longest increasing subsequences.
