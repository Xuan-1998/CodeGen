===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a top-down approach using dynamic programming with memoization, where you recursively explore all possible subsequences and store previously computed results in a DP table to avoid redundant computations.

DP[i]: number of longest increasing subsequences ending at index i
Determine the maximum number of longest increasing subsequences ending at each index by iterating through the array and updating a dynamic programming table with values from memoization

DP table initialization: Set all DP[i] = 1, since a single element is always an increasing subsequence of length 1.

For each element in the array:
    For each previous element j such that arr[j] < arr[i]:
        Update DP[i] = max(DP[i], DP[j] + 1)

Return the maximum value in the DP table as the number of longest increasing subsequences
