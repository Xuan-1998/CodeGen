===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming without memoization, where you iteratively build up the solution by considering all possible subsequences.

DP[i]: length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i
Initialize DP with zeros for each index i in the array.
Iterate through the array from left to right:
For each element arr[i]:
    Update DP[i] = 1 if it's the first element (or LIS ending at previous elements is less than 1).
    Otherwise, find the largest j such that arr[j] < arr[i], and update DP[i] as max(DP[j] + 1, DP[i]).
Return the maximum value in DP array.

This approach ensures that we consider all possible subsequences and avoid redundant computations.
