===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming with memoization, where you iteratively build up the solution by considering all possible subsequences and store previously computed results in a memo dictionary to avoid redundant computations.

DP[i]: number of longest increasing subsequences ending at index i
Define a state as a tuple (i, prev), where i is the current index and prev is the previous element in the subsequence, then transition to the next state by considering all possible next elements that are greater than prev.

Dynamic Programming with Memoization: Implement an iterative function with memoization to store previously computed results and avoid redundant computations. Initialize a dictionary dp to store the number of longest increasing subsequences ending at each index. Iterate through the array from left to right, updating dp[i] for each element i.

Transition rules:
- If prev is None, then there's only one way to extend the subsequence (by adding the current element), so set dp[i] = 1
- Otherwise, consider all possible next elements that are greater than prev, and update dp[i] by taking the maximum of the lengths of subsequences ending at those indices

Edge cases:
- Handle the case where the array is empty or contains only one element. In this case, return 0 or 1 respectively.
- Handle the case where the array contains a single increasing subsequence. In this case, return 1.
