===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming with memoization, where you iteratively build up the dp table by iterating over the array elements in order, considering each element as the end of a potential increasing subsequence and recursively exploring all possible predecessors to find the maximum length.

Let DP[i] be the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i. Initially, set DP[i] = 1 for all i (since a single-element subsequence is always increasing).

Iterate over the array elements in order. For each element x at index i:
    - Initialize max_length to 0.
    - Iterate over previous elements y at indices j < i such that y <= x:
        - If y + 1 > max_length, update max_length = DP[j] + 1.
    - Update DP[i] = max_length.

Finally, iterate over the array and count the number of occurrences of the maximum value in the dp table to get the number of longest increasing subsequences.
