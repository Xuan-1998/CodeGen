===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify a hybrid approach that combines top-down and bottom-up strategies, such as using dynamic programming to precompute the lengths of all possible subsequences and then counting the maximum length subsequences.

The state can be a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index j in the first i elements. Initialize dp with zeros, with size (n+1) x n, where n is the length of the input array.

Fill up the dp array by iterating through the array and for each element at index j:
    Iterate from i = 1 to j-1 (inclusive).
        If the current element is greater than the previous one (i.e., arr[j] > arr[i]), update dp[i][j] as follows:
            If j = 0, set dp[i][j] = 1.
            Otherwise, set dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] + 1) for k from i-1 to j (inclusive).
    Return the maximum length of all longest increasing subsequences, which is stored in dp[n][j].
