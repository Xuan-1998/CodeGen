===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a top-down approach using dynamic programming with memoization, where you recursively explore all possible subsequences and store previously computed results in a memo dictionary to avoid redundant computations.

DP[i]: number of longest increasing subsequences ending at index i

Define a state as a tuple (i, prev), where i is the current index and prev is the previous element in the subsequence, then transition to the next state by considering all possible next elements that are greater than prev.

Top-Down Memoization:
    - Initialize memo dictionary dp with default value 0.
    - Define recursive function dfs(i, prev) that calculates number of longest increasing subsequences ending at index i and previous element is prev.
        * Base case: If i is out of bounds or arr[i] < prev, return 1 (since it's the first element in a new subsequence).
        * Recursively explore all possible next elements that are greater than prev:
            + For each next element j:
                - Calculate number of longest increasing subsequences ending at index j and previous element is arr[j].
                - If j > i, update dp[i] to max(dp[i], dfs(j, arr[j])).
        * Return dp[i].

Main Function:
    - Initialize memo dictionary with default value 0.
    - For each index i in the array:
        + Call dfs(i, -1) (since we start from the first element).
        + Update answer with maximum number of longest increasing subsequences ending at index i.
