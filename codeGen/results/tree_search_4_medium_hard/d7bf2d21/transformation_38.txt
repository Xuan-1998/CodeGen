===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem can be solved by tabulating the bottom-up approach, where you fill up an array with the values of longest increasing subsequence and then count the number of maximum length subsequences

dp[i] = max(dp[j] for j in range(i) if arr[j] < arr[i]) + 1, where i is the index of the array element
Implement memoization using a dictionary where keys are indices and values are the lengths of longest increasing subsequences ending at those indices.

Find all indices j such that arr[j] < arr[i], calculate dp[i] as above for each j, and update the maximum length found so far. The final answer is the count of maximum length found.
