DP[i][j]: length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i with j elements
Consider two states: DP[i][k] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i with k elements, where k is the number of elements in this subsequence.
1. Initialize a 2D array DP with size (n+1) * (n+1), where n is the length of the input array.
   Fill up all DP[i][0] values with 1 since each element forms a single-element increasing subsequence.
2. Iterate over the input array and for each element at index i:
   a. Update DP[i][j] values by considering two possibilities:
      * If the current element is greater than the previous one, it can be appended to the existing increasing subsequence of length j-1.
      * If the current element is not greater than any previous one, start a new increasing subsequence of length 1.
   b. Update DP[i][j] as the maximum of these two possibilities plus one (since we're considering subsequences ending at index i).
3. Initialize variables to store the maximum length and count of longest increasing subsequences.
4. Iterate over the last row of the DP array, and for each cell:
   a. If the value is greater than the previous maximum length, update the maximum length and increment the count.
5. Return the count as the result.
