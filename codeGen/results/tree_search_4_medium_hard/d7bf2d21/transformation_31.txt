===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem can be solved by tabulating the bottom-up approach, where you fill up an array with the values of longest increasing subsequences and then count the number of maximum length subsequences.

dp[i] = max(dp[j] + 1 for j in range(i) if arr[j] < arr[i]), where i is the index of the array element

Think about how you can use the properties of longest increasing subsequences to formulate state and transition relationships.

Explore the possibility of using a bottom-up approach where you iterate through the array from left to right, maintaining a table of the maximum length of increasing subsequences seen so far.

Count the number of times the maximum length is reached in the dp array to get the total count of longest increasing subsequences.

Initialize dp array with values initialized to 1 (since single elements are always increasing subsequences).

Iterate through the array, updating each element in the dp array based on the previously processed elements that are less than the current element.

Finally, iterate through the dp array and count the number of maximum length subsequences by finding the last occurrence of the maximum value in the dp array. This will give you the total count of longest increasing subsequences.
