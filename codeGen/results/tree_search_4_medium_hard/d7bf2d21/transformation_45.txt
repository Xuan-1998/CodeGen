===BEGIN PLAN===
Let's iterate through each element in the array and for each element, find the maximum length of increasing subsequence ending at that position.

For each i:
  For each j < i: 
    If arr[j] < arr[i], then we can extend the subsequence ending at index j by 1 to get a new subsequence ending at i
    So dp[i] = max(dp[j] for j in range(i)) + 1

Then, count the number of maximum length subsequences.
