===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i] = max(dp[j] for j in range(i)) + 1
where i is the index of the array element
dp[i] = length of longest increasing subsequence ending at index i

Dynamic Programming Solution:
Use memoization by storing and reusing previously computed values in a dictionary.
Create a dictionary dp to store the lengths of longest increasing subsequences ending at each index.

1. Initialize dp with all zeros, since the maximum length of any subsequence is initially unknown.
2. Iterate through the array from left to right (or right to left).
3. For each element i:
    1. Find the maximum length of a longest increasing subsequence ending at any previous index j such that arr[i] > arr[j].
    2. Update dp[i] = max(dp[j]) + 1.
4. At the end, count the number of elements with the same maximum length as the maximum possible value for all indices.

This plan correctly identifies the problem as a dynamic programming problem and proposes an efficient solution using memoization.
The potential issues with this plan include:
- The plan assumes that the array is non-empty; it should be checked at the beginning to avoid potential errors.
- There might be duplicate longest increasing subsequences, so we need to count how many have the maximum length.

Improved Plan:
