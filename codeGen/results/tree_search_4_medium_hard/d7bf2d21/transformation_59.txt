===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify a hybrid approach that combines top-down and bottom-up strategies by using dynamic programming to precompute the lengths of all possible subsequences.

The state can be a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index j in the first i elements.

Consider a subproblem where you try to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence by iterating through the array and maintaining the maximum length seen so far. When encountering an element that is greater than the previous one, add 1 to the current maximum length.

To count the number of maximum length subsequences, iterate through the dp[i][j] array and keep track of the maximum length found for each i. Then, for each i, iterate through the dp[i][j] array and count the number of elements with the maximum length seen so far.
