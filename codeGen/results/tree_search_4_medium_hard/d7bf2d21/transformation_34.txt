===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem can be solved by tabulating the bottom-up approach, where you fill up an array with the values of longest increasing subsequences and then count the number of maximum length subsequences
Create a 1D DP table dp where dp[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i
Initialize dp[0] to 1 since there's only one possible subsequence for the first element
Iterate through the array from left to right, updating the dynamic programming table at each step:
    For each element arr[i]:
        Find the maximum length subsequence that ends at any previous element j such that arr[j] < arr[i]
        Update dp[i] as max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
Use a variable count to keep track of the number of maximum length subsequences
Initialize count to 0
Iterate through the array from right to left, updating the count at each step:
    For each element arr[i]:
        If dp[i] is equal to the maximum value seen so far, increment count
Return the count as the answer
