===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the state as a 2D array dp[i][j] where it represents whether there is a path from node i to node j and the length of that path. 
For each cell in the array, we iterate over all possible previous elements and check if they are increasing. If they are, then update dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k], dp[k][j]) + 1 where k is the index of the previous element. If not, then dp[i][j] = max(0, dp[i-1][j]) or dp[i][j] = max(0, dp[i][j-1]). 
Then, we can calculate the number of longest increasing subsequences by iterating over all cells in the array and counting the maximum length.
