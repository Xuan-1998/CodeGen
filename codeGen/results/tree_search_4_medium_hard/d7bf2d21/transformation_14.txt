===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming with memoization, where you iteratively build up the solution from the base cases.

DP[i]: length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i
Initialize the memo dictionary as an array of size n+1, where n is the length of the input array. All elements are initially set to 0.

For each element in the array (from left to right):
    For each previous element:
        If the current element is greater than the previous one, update DP[i] if necessary.
    Update the memo dictionary with the maximum value from the current and all previously computed values.

Finally, count the number of longest increasing subsequences by iterating through the memo array and returning the frequency of the maximum length.
