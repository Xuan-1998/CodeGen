===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem can be solved by tabulating the bottom-up approach, where you fill up an array with the values of longest increasing subsequences and then count the number of maximum length subsequences
Create a dynamic programming (DP) table dp of size n+1, where n is the length of the input array.
Fill up the DP table using a bottom-up approach:
    for each element in the array from left to right:
        if the current element is greater than the previous one, increment its value by 1
        else, reset it to 1 (since we're considering a new increasing subsequence)
Count the number of maximum length subsequences
    initialize a variable count to 0
    for each element in the DP table:
        if the current value is equal to the maximum length found so far, increment the count by 1
    return the count
