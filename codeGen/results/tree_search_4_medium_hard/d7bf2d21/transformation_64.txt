===BEGIN PLAN===
Define dp as a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents whether the longest increasing subsequence ending at index j contains element i.

Initialize dp with False for all entries, and set dp[0][i] to True for all i because every element is part of its own increasing subsequence.

For each i from 1 to n (where n is the length of the array), iterate over each j from 0 to n-1.
  If arr[j] < i, then update dp[i][j] to dp[i-1][j] because the longest increasing subsequence ending at index j and containing element i must contain all elements up to i.

Then, for each i, find the maximum length of the subsequences that end at each j such that dp[i][j] is True. This can be done by iterating over each j from 0 to n-1 and updating max_length with max(max_length, j+1) whenever dp[i][j] is True.

Finally, return the number of different values of max_length found.
