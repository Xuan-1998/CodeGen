===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming with memoization, where you iteratively build up solutions for smaller subproblems and store previously computed results in a memo dictionary to avoid redundant computations.

memo: dictionary storing the lengths of longest increasing subsequences ending at each index
DP[i]: length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i

Initialization:
  - For each element i in the array, set DP[i] = 1 (since the longest increasing subsequence ending at i is just i itself)

Transition:
  - For each pair (i, j) where 0 <= i < len(array) and 0 <= j <= i,
    - If array[j] > array[i], update DP[i] = max(DP[i], DP[j] + 1)
    - Store the updated value in memo

Final answer:
  - Return the maximum value in memo (which represents the number of longest increasing subsequences)
