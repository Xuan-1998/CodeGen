===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the state as a dictionary dp[{i, j}] = k, where k is the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index j in the first i elements.

Iterate over the array from left to right, and for each element at index i:
    For each previous element at index j < i, check if the current element is greater than the previous one.
        If it is, update dp[i][j] = 1, indicating that the longest increasing subsequence ending at index j contains this new element.
    Initialize a variable max_length = 0 to store the maximum length of subsequences.

For each row i in the dp table:
    Initialize a variable max_ending_here = 0 to store the maximum length of subsequences ending at current position i.
    For each column j in the dp table, check if dp[i][j] == 1 and max_ending_here < dp[j][j]:
        Update max_ending_here = dp[j][j].
    Update max_length = max(max_length, max_ending_here).

Return max_length as the number of longest increasing subsequences.
