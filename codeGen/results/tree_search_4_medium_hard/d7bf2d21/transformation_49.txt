===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem can be solved by tabulating the bottom-up approach, where you fill up an array with the values of longest increasing subsequence and then count the number of maximum length subsequences
Create a table dp of size n, where n is the length of the input array
For each element i in the array:
    Initialize dp[i] to 1
    For j from 0 to i-1:
        If the current element at index i is greater than the previous element at index j:
            Update dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
Count the number of maximum length subsequences by iterating through the table and updating a variable for the maximum count
Return the maximum count as the answer
