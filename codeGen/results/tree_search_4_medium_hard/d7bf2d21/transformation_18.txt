===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming with a 2D array dp where each cell dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i and having j elements.

Initialize dp with zeros, where dp[i][0] = 1 for all i (base case: single-element subsequences are always increasing).

For each element in the input array:

1. Iterate over possible lengths of increasing subsequences (j) from 2 to the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at the previous position.
2. For each j:
   a. Check if the current element is greater than or equal to the last element in the subsequence of length j-1.
   b. If true, update dp[i][j] with max(dp[i-1][j-1], 1) + 1 (the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i and having j elements).
3. Update memo dictionary to store previously computed results for overlapping subproblems.

To find the number of longest increasing subsequences, iterate over dp array and count the occurrences of the maximum value.
