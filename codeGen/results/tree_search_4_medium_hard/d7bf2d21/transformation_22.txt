===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming with memoization and counting, where you iteratively explore all possible subsequences and store previously computed results in a dictionary to avoid redundant computations.

Memo: {i: count_of_longest_increasing_subsequence[i]: number of longest increasing subsequences ending at index i}

View this problem as an instance of the classic problem 'Counting Longest Increasing Subsequences' (CLIS) and leverage existing solutions such as dynamic programming with a 1D array or binary search-based approach.

Store previously computed results in a dictionary to avoid redundant computations and optimize time complexity.

When processing each element, calculate the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at that index and update the count accordingly.

Finally, return the total count of longest increasing subsequences found throughout the array.
