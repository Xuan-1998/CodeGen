===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem can be solved by tabulating the bottom-up approach, where you fill up an array with the values of longest increasing subsequence and then count the number of maximum length subsequences
dp[i] = max(dp[j] + 1 for j in range(i) if arr[j] < arr[i]), where i is the index of the array element
Use a bottom-up approach where you iterate through the array from left to right, updating the dynamic programming table at each step.
Implement memoization by storing the lengths of longest increasing subsequences in a dictionary as you iterate through the array, then count the number of maximum length subsequences.
dp = [0] * len(arr)
max_length = 1
count = 0
for i in range(len(arr)):
    dp[i] = max(dp[j] + 1 for j in range(i) if arr[j] < arr[i])
    if dp[i] == max_length:
        count += 1
    elif dp[i] > max_length:
        max_length = dp[i]
        count = 1
print(count)
