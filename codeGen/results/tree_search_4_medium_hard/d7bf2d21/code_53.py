===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem can be solved by tabulating the bottom-up approach, where you fill up an array with the values of longest increasing subsequences and then count the number of maximum length subsequences

dp = [1] * len(array)  # initialize dp array with all ones (minimum length)
max_length_count = [0]  # initialize an array to store the count of maximum length subsequences
prev_max_length = 0  # keep track of the previous maximum length

for i in range(len(array)):
    for j in range(i):
        if array[j] < array[i]:  # check if the current element is part of a longer increasing subsequence
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)  # update dp[i] as the maximum length of increasing subsequence ending at index i
    prev_max_length = max(prev_max_length, dp[i])  # keep track of the previous maximum length

max_length_count.append(sum([count for count in [dp[i] == prev_max_length for i in range(len(array))].count(True) if count > 0]))

# return the count of longest increasing subsequences
return max_length_count[0]
