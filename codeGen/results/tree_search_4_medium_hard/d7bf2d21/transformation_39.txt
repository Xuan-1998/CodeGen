===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem can be solved by tabulating the bottom-up approach, where you fill up an array with the values of longest increasing subsequence and then count the number of maximum length subsequences.

dp[i] = max(dp[j] for j in range(i) if arr[j] < arr[i]) + 1

Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where dp[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.

Utilize a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by filling up an array with the values of longest increasing subsequence and then count the number of maximum length subsequences.

Count the number of occurrences of the maximum value in the dp array to get the total count of longest increasing subsequences.

Initialize a variable max_length = 1, which will store the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequences. Initialize a variable count = 0, which will keep track of the total count of maximum length subsequences.

Iterate over the input array from left to right and for each element at index i:

    If arr[i] is greater than any previously seen element, update max_length and count accordingly.
    Otherwise, find the last previously seen element j such that arr[j] < arr[i], and update dp[i] = dp[j] + 1.

Finally, return the value of count as it represents the total number of longest increasing subsequences.
