===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine if the problem can be solved by tabulating the bottom-up approach, where you fill up an array with the values of longest increasing subsequences and then count the number of maximum length subsequences

dp[i] = len([j for j in range(i) if arr[j] < arr[i]]) + 1, where i is the index of the array element
Explore the idea of keeping track of the last element in a sequence and using it to determine whether a new sequence can be formed

Initialize an empty dictionary dp with keys as the indices of the array elements
For each element in the array:
    Initialize the longest increasing subsequence ending at this element to 1
    For each previous element that is smaller than the current element:
        Update the longest increasing subsequence ending at this element if it's longer than before
    Update dp with the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequences ending at each element

Count the number of occurrences of the maximum length in dp and return this count as the result
