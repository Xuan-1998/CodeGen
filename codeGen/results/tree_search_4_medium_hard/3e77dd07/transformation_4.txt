Whether the scrambling operation can be decomposed into smaller subproblems, allowing for a dynamic programming solution.

The state expression could be a boolean array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1), where n and m are the lengths of s1 and s2 respectively, indicating whether s2[0...i] can be obtained by scrambling s1[0...j]. The base case would be when i or j is 0.

Whether the scrambled string can be decomposed into smaller subproblems where swapping characters between two non-overlapping substrings in s1 is considered as one operation.

Implement memoization using a hash map where the key is the tuple (i, j) and the value is a boolean indicating whether s2[0...i] can be obtained by scrambling s1[0...j].

To improve this plan, we need to specify the function that will help us determine if two strings are scrambled. This function should compare characters from s1 and s2 in pairs and check if they match.

The potential issues with the plan include not considering the edge cases where i or j is 0. We also need to handle the case where s1[0...j] contains duplicate characters, which can make it difficult to determine whether s2[0...i] can be obtained by scrambling s1[0...j].

Edge cases:
- When i and j are both 0.
- When only one of i or j is 0.
