===BEGIN PLAN===
Whether the scrambling operation can be decomposed into smaller subproblems, allowing for a dynamic programming solution.

The state expression could be a boolean array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1), where n and m are the lengths of s1 and s2 respectively, indicating whether s2[0...i] can be obtained by scrambling s1[0...j].

The base case would be when i or j is 0. This is because a string with length 0 can always be scrambled into an empty string.

The scrambled string of a character in s1 matches the corresponding character in s2, regardless of whether they match each other. This means we don't need to worry about characters matching between strings, only if the substrings can be scrambled.

Initialize dp as a boolean array of size (n+1) x (m+1) and set all values to False initially. Then, for each character in both strings, check if the characters at that position match or not. If they don't, then fill the corresponding dp value with True.

For every pair of matching characters, recursively call the function for the substrings after these two characters. This will give us the base case when i and j are decreasing by 1 each time until they reach 0.

The final answer is dp[n][m]. If it's True, then s2 can be scrambled into s1; otherwise, it cannot.
