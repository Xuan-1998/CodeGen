To improve the plan:
* Instead of comparing the frequency of each character, we can sort the characters in s1 and s2 from 0 to i and check if they are equal. This will avoid incorrect results when there are duplicate characters.
* The hash table approach is not necessary because we don't need to keep track of the frequency of each character.
