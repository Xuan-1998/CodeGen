===BEGIN PLAN===
Partition the strings into overlapping subproblems by defining a state as (i, j) where i is the index of s1 and j is the index of s2, and check if they are scrambled strings up to those indices. 
Use memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computation.
Define a 2D array dp of size (len(s1), len(s2)) to store the results of subproblems as (i, j) where i is the index of s1 and j is the index of s2.
The base case: if s1[i] == s2[j], then return True because they match at this position.
Recursively check if the remaining strings s1[:i+1] and s2[:j+1] are scrambled. If not, return False. 
If i < len(s1) - 1, partition s1 into two substrings: left and right, where left is from index 0 to i-1 and right is from i to the end of s1.
Similarly, partition s2 into two substrings: left and right, where left is from index 0 to j-1 and right is from j to the end of s2.
Check if there exists a permutation such that the left part of s1 is scrambled with the left part of s2, and the right part of s1 is scrambled with the right part of s2. 
Return True if all permutations satisfy the condition; otherwise, return False.
