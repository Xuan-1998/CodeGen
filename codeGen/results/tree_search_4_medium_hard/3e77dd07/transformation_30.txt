===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can identify a recursive structure in the problem that allows us to break it down into smaller instances of the same problem.

The state could be the position in the string, and the base case would be when the end of the string is reached.
The state could be a tuple of two indices into s1 and s2, representing the current position in each string. The base case would be when both indices reach the end of their respective strings. The transition relation would involve incrementing one or both of the indices depending on whether we're comparing characters at the same position.

We can use dynamic programming to fill in a 2D table, where each cell represents whether the substrings s1[:i] and s2[:j] are scrambled.
Start by filling in the base case (i.e., when i or j is equal to the length of the string), then work your way back up.

To improve this plan, we can consider using a more efficient data structure than a 2D table, such as a trie or suffix tree. This could help us avoid redundant computations and reduce the time complexity.
We should also handle edge cases carefully, such as when one of the strings is a prefix of the other.

Here's the updated version of the plan:
