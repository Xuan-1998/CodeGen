===BEGIN PLAN===
Code:
dp[i][j] = (s1[:i+1] == s2[:j+1]) or \
           ((i > 0 and dp[i-1][j-1]) and \
            (isScrambled(s1[:i], s2[:j])))

where isScrambled is a function that checks if two strings are scrambled

Define a state as the pair (i, j) representing the current positions in s1 and s2, and use memoization to avoid recalculating the same states multiple times.

To check if two strings are scrambled, sort them and compare.
