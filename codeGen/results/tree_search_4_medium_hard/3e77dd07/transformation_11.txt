===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using Dynamic Programming, we can define the state as (i, j) where i is the index of s1 and j is the index of s2, and check if they are scrambled strings up to those indices. We can then use memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computation.

The plan can be broken down into the following steps:

* Initialize a 2D array dp with size (len(s1) + 1) x (len(s2) + 1), filled with False values, representing whether s2 is scrambled up to indices i in s1 and j in s2.
* Define a recursive function isScrambled(i, j) that takes two indices i and j representing the current position in s1 and s2 respectively. The function should return True if the substring from 0 to i in s1 is scrambled with the substring from 0 to j in s2.

Within the recursive function:

* If i or j reaches the end of their respective strings, return True if they are equal, indicating that the substrings are identical and therefore scrambled.
* Otherwise, for each possible way to partition the current substring into two parts (e.g., [s1[:i/2], s1[i/2:i]], [s2[:j/2], s2[j/2:j]]), recursively check if each part is a scrambled string using the function isScrambled.
* If any of the recursive calls return True, return True. Otherwise, return False.

The plan can be summarized as follows:
