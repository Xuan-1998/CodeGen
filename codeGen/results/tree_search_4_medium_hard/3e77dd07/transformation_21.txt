===BEGIN PLAN===
To determine if s2 is a scrambled string of s1, we can use Dynamic Programming and memoization.

State: (i, j) represents the indices of the current overlapping subproblem;
Transition:
    - If i == 0 or j == 0, return whether the remaining parts of both strings are scrambled.
    - Else, partition s1 and s2 into two non-empty substrings at indices i-1 and j-1.
    - Recursively check if the left and right subtrees of the current node are scrambled.
    - If they are, then the current node is also scrambled.

Memoization:
    - Store the result for each subproblem in a 2D array memo[i][j].
    - Before making any recursive calls, check if the result for the current subproblem is already stored in memo[i][j].
    - If it is, return the cached result.
    - If not, recursively partition s1 and s2 into two non-empty substrings at indices i-1 and j-1, and store the result in memo[i][j].

Edge cases:
    - Handle strings of length 0 by returning True (since an empty string is scrambled with itself).
    - Handle strings of different lengths by returning False.
