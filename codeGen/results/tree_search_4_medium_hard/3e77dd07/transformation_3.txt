Whether the scrambling operation can be decomposed into smaller subproblems, allowing for a dynamic programming solution.

The state expression could be a boolean array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1), where n and m are the lengths of s1 and s2 respectively, indicating whether s2[0...i] can be obtained by scrambling s1[0...j]. The base case would be when i or j is 0.

Whether the scrambled string can be decomposed into smaller subproblems where swapping characters between two non-overlapping substrings in s1 is considered as one operation.

Use a boolean array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1) to represent whether s2[0...i] can be obtained by scrambling s1[0...j].

For each cell dp[i][j], check if the corresponding characters at positions i and j in s1 and s2 are equal. If they are, then we know that the scrambled string is the same up to this point.

If not, consider all possible ways to scramble s1[0...i-1] and s2[0...j-1], and check if any of these scrambling operations can lead to s2[i] being equal to s1[j]. If so, then we know that dp[i][j] is true.

The final answer would be dp[n][m].
