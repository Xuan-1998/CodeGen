Whether the scrambling operation can be decomposed into smaller subproblems, allowing for a dynamic programming solution.

The state expression could be a boolean array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1), where n and m are the lengths of s1 and s2 respectively, indicating whether s2[0...i] can be obtained by scrambling s1[0...j].

For each cell dp[i][j], if the characters at indices i-1 and j-1 in s1 and s2 are equal, then it is possible to scramble s2[0...i-1] from s1[0...j-1]. If not, we recursively check all possible scrambles of s2[0...i-1] from s1[0...j-1], and return True if any of them are true. 

The base case would be when i or j is 0.

The number of distinct characters in s1 and s2 are the same, which ensures that the scrambled string will also have the same number of distinct characters as s1.

Use memoization with a dictionary to store the intermediate results in order to avoid redundant computations and reduce time complexity.
