===BEGIN PLAN===
Whether the scrambling operation can be decomposed into smaller subproblems, allowing for a dynamic programming solution.

The state expression could be a boolean array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1), where n and m are the lengths of s1 and s2 respectively, indicating whether s2[0...i] can be obtained by scrambling s1[0...j].

The base case would be when i or j is 0.

Fill dp[i][j] with True if s1[0...i-1] and s2[0...j-1] are scrambled versions of each other.
If the current characters in s1 and s2 match, fill dp[i][j] with dp[i-1][j-1].
Recursively check for scrambled strings from left and right halves of s1 and s2.
