Plan:
Is there a way to partition the strings into overlapping subproblems, making memoization more effective.

To define the state as (i, j) where i is the index of s1 and j is the index of s2 and check if they are scrambled strings up to those indices.
The state can be defined as a tuple containing the sorted characters of the substring of s1 up to the current position, and the same for s2. The transition relationship would be to move to the next character in both strings.

Memoize the function that checks if two substrings are scrambled strings.

The plan is correct. It utilizes dynamic programming by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, which share overlapping solutions.

To improve the plan:
- Consider using a dictionary instead of memoization for faster lookups.
- Use recursion to break down the problem into smaller subproblems.

Potential issues with the plan:
- Edge cases: The plan does not account for edge cases where i or j reaches the end of their respective strings. A check should be added to handle this situation.

The updated plan includes edge cases and utilizes a dictionary instead of memoization:
