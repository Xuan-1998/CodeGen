===BEGIN PLAN===
Partition the strings into overlapping subproblems by considering all possible splits of s1 and s2 into two non-empty substrings. 
To define the state as (i, j) where i is the length of the longest common prefix of s1[:i] and s2[:j] and check if the remaining parts of both strings are scrambled.
State: (i, j) represents the indices of the current overlapping subproblem; Transition: recursively partition s1[:i] and s2[:j] into two non-empty substrings at indices i-1 and j or i and j-1.
Use a 3D array to store the dp states as (i, j, k) where i is the length of the longest common prefix of s1[:i] and s2[:j], and check if the remaining parts of both strings are scrambled for each character k.
To determine if two substrings are scrambled, consider all possible ways to partition them into non-empty substrings and check if one can be obtained from another by swapping the children of any non-leaf node. 
If we have found a way to scramble s1[:i] and s2[:j], return True; otherwise, return False.
