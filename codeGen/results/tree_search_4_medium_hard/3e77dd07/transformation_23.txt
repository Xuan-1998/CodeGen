===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using Dynamic Programming:
State: (i, j) represents the scrambled status of the substring from index 0 to i in s1 and j in s2;
Transition: if s1[i] == s2[j], return True; otherwise, partition the remaining parts and recursively check if they are scrambled.
Define a DP array dp where dp[i][j] is True if the substring from index 0 to i in s1 and j in s2 are scrambled, and False otherwise;
Partition the strings into overlapping subproblems by checking if the current characters match, and memoize the results;
Use bottom-up dynamic programming to fill up the DP array;
For each cell dp[i][j], check if the remaining parts of both strings are scrambled; 
If they are, return True; otherwise, return False.
