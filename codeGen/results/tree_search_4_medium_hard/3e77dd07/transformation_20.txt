dp[i][j] is True if s1[:i] and s2[:j] are scrambled, False otherwise.

Initialization: dp[0][0] = True.
Filling the DP table:
    1. Iterate from i = 0 to n-1 and j = 0 to m-1.
    2. Calculate the LCP of s1[:i+1] and s2[:j+1], say k.
    3. Check if the remaining parts s1[i+k:] and s2[j+k:] are scrambled.
    4. If True, set dp[i][j] = dp[i-k][j-k].
