===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can create a memoization table where each entry represents whether the substrings s1[:i] and s2[:j] are scrambled.
We initialize all entries in the table to False, because initially we don't know if any two strings are scrambled.
Then we iterate over the length of the input strings. For each length i, we check if the characters in the first i positions of s1 and s2 are equal.
If they are equal, that means the strings are not scrambled, so we set all entries for this length to False.
Next, we need to consider all possible ways to scramble the string. We can do this by considering all possible splits of the string into two non-empty substrings.
For each split position j, we check if the characters in the first j positions of s1 and s2 are equal.
If they are equal, that means these two parts of the strings are scrambled.
We then recursively check if the remaining parts are also scrambled. If both checks pass, it means the whole string is scrambled, so we set this entry to True.
Finally, we return the result of the memoization table for the given lengths.
