Whether the scrambling operation can be decomposed into smaller subproblems, allowing for a dynamic programming solution.

The state expression could be a boolean array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1), where n and m are the lengths of s1 and s2 respectively, indicating whether s2[0...i] can be obtained by scrambling s1[0...j]. The base case would be when i or j is 0.

Whether the scrambled string can be decomposed into smaller subproblems where swapping characters between two non-overlapping substrings in s1 is considered as one operation.

Tabulate a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1) to store the results of subproblems, where dp[i][j] represents whether s2[0...i] can be obtained by scrambling s1[0...j].

For each cell dp[i][j], check if it's possible to scramble s1[0...j] into s2[0...i]. If yes, mark the cell as true; otherwise, mark it as false.

The final result would be dp[n][m].
