===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can partition the strings into overlapping subproblems as follows:

State: dp[i][j] is a boolean indicating whether the substring from index i to j is scrambled;

Transition:
    for each character c at position k, 
    if s1[i..j] matches s2[k..k+m], 
        set dp[i][j] = True if and only if
            dp[i+1][k+m-1] and dp[k+m][j-1] are both True;

Memoization dictionary: store the intermediate results to avoid redundant computations.

To improve the plan, we can handle edge cases as follows:

    If i >= j or k >= m, return False (since a substring cannot be scrambled if it is shorter than its corresponding part);

    Initialize dp[0][0] = True (since an empty string is always scrambled with itself);

    For longer strings, iterate over all possible positions k and lengths m to compute the transitions;

    Finally, return dp[0][s1.length() - 1] (since this indicates whether s2 is a scrambled string of s1).
