===BEGIN PLAN===
Is there a way to partition the strings into overlapping subproblems, making memoization more effective.
To define the state as (i, j) where i is the index of s1 and j is the index of s2 and check if they are scrambled strings up to those indices.
Partition the strings into non-overlapping subproblems by considering all possible ways to partition the string into two parts, and then recursively check if each part is a scrambled string.
Consider using a 3D DP table where dp[i][j][k] represents whether the first i characters of s1 are scrambled with the first j characters of s2 when k is the index of the current character that we consider for scrambling.
The base case would be when the strings up to the current indices are equal, then they are definitely scrambled.
When the current character in both strings matches, then recursively check if the rest of the strings are scrambled.
When the current characters do not match, then try all possible ways to scramble and recursively check if the rest of the strings are scrambled for each possibility.
The final answer would be whether dp[n][n][0] is True where n is the length of the string.
