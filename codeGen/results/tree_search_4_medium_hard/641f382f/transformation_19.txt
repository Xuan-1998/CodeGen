===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
1. Initialize a 3D array dp[n][n][2] where dp[i][j][0] will store the minimum number of operations required to make all elements from the i-th to the j-th (inclusive) have a gcd of 1, and dp[i][j][1] will store the gcd of the subarray [i, j]. Set all values of dp[i][j][0] to a large number (e.g., INT_MAX) to represent the initial state of no operations being performed, except for dp[i][i][0] which should be set to 0 if arr[i] is 1, otherwise it should remain INT_MAX. For dp[i][j][1], initialize it to the actual gcd of the subarray [i, j].

2. Use a nested loop to calculate the gcd for all subarrays. This can be done efficiently by using the result of the gcd of the previous subarray and extending it by one element at a time.

3. Use dynamic programming to find the minimum number of operations for each subarray to have a gcd of 1. This involves iterating over all possible subarrays [i, j] and for each subarray, iterating over all possible k where i <= k < j. The recurrence relation is as follows:
   dp[i][j][0] = min(dp[i][j][0], dp[i][k][0] + dp[k+1][j][0] + 1) if gcd(dp[i][k][1], dp[k+1][j][1]) == 1.

4. The base case is when the subarray length is 1, where the number of operations is 0 if the element is 1, otherwise it's impossible to make it 1, so we keep it as INT_MAX.

5. After filling the dp table, the answer will be dp[0][n-1][0] if it's not INT_MAX, otherwise print -1 if it's not possible to make all elements equal to 1.

6. The plan takes into account the edge case where an element of the array is already 1 and the case where it is impossible to make all elements equal to 1.

7. This plan improves upon the initial idea by removing the unnecessary third dimension for gcd in the dp table and simplifies the cost calculation, as we are only interested in whether we can achieve a gcd of 1, not the specific gcd values of subarrays.
