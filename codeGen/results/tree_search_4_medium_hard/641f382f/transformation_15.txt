===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize a 2D array dp where dp[i][g] represents the minimum number of operations required to reduce the first i elements to 1, with the last operation resulting in a GCD of g. The array size will be n x max(arr).

2. Set the base case for the DP array:
   - For g = arr[0], set dp[0][g] = 0 because no operation is needed when there's only one element.
   - For all other g, set dp[0][g] = INFINITY or a large number to represent an impossible state.

3. Iterate over the elements of the array starting from the second element (i = 1) to the last element (i = n-1):
   - For each element, iterate over all possible GCD values g (from 1 to the maximum element in the array):
     - Set dp[i][g] to INFINITY initially.
     - Find the minimum number of operations needed for the subarray ending at the current element and having a GCD of g.
     - This is done by iterating over all h (from 1 to the maximum element in the array) and checking if the GCD of h and arr[i] is g:
       - If it is, update dp[i][g] to min(dp[i][g], dp[i-1][h] + 1) because we can make the last two elements have GCD g by performing one operation on the subarray ending at i-1 with GCD h.

4. After filling the DP table, the answer will be the minimum value in the last row of dp for g = 1, as we want all elements to have a GCD of 1. If this value is INFINITY, return -1 as it's not possible to make all elements equal to 1.

5. Handle edge cases:
   - If the array already contains a 1, return 0 since no operation is needed.
   - If after processing the DP table, the minimum number of operations is INFINITY, return -1 as it indicates that it's not possible to make all elements equal to 1.

6. Optimize the DP table space complexity by realizing that dp[i] only depends on dp[i-1], so we can use a rolling array or just two arrays to keep track of the current and previous states to reduce space complexity from O(n * max(arr)) to O(2 * max(arr)).

7. Optimize the GCD computations by using a precomputed table or efficient algorithm to avoid repeated calculations.
