===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
1. Initialize a 2D array dp[n][n], where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make all elements from the i-th to the j-th (inclusive) equal to 1, with the base case dp[i][i] = 0 for all i.
2. For each subarray from i to j, compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the subarray. If the GCD is 1, then dp[i][j] = dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + 1 for some k between i and j. Otherwise, dp[i][j] = -1.
3. Define dp[i] as the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarray from 1 to i equal to 1. Initialize dp[i] to a large number for all i.
4. Set dp[0] to 0 as the base case, representing an empty subarray.
5. For each i from 1 to n, iterate over all subarrays ending at i:
   a. For each j from 0 to i-1, if the GCD of the subarray from j+1 to i is 1, update dp[i] to the minimum of its current value and dp[j] + 1.
6. Return dp[n] as the result. If dp[n] is still a large number, it means it is not possible to make all elements equal to 1, so return -1.
7. To optimize space, we can avoid storing the entire 2D dp array by computing GCDs on the fly and only maintaining a 1D dp array.
8. Handle edge cases such as:
   a. If any element of the array is already 1, the answer is 0 because no operations are needed.
   b. If it is not possible to make any subarray have a GCD of 1, return -1 immediately.
