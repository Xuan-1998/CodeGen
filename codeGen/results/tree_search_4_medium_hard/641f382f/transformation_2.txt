===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
1. Initialize a 2D array dp[n][n] where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make all elements from the i-th to the j-th (inclusive) equal to 1. Set all values to a large number (e.g., infinity) to denote that they haven't been computed yet, with the base case dp[i][i] = 0 for all i, since a single element is already equal to 1 or can never be made 1.

2. Precompute the greatest common divisor (GCD) for all possible subarrays. This can be done using a 2D array gcd[n][n] where gcd[i][j] stores the GCD of the subarray from the i-th to the j-th element. This step is crucial for optimization and can be done in O(n^2 * log(max(ai))) time.

3. Fill in the dp array using a bottom-up approach. For each length of the subarray from 2 to n, and for each starting point of the subarray:
   - If gcd[i][j] is 1, then dp[i][j] = 0 because no operations are needed.
   - Otherwise, for each possible split point k in the subarray (i, j), update dp[i][j] to the minimum of its current value and the sum of dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + 1, if gcd[i][k] and gcd[k+1][j] are both 1. The +1 accounts for the operation of taking the GCD of the two parts.

4. After filling the dp array, the answer will be in dp[0][n-1]. However, if this value is still set to infinity, it means it's not possible to make all elements equal to 1, and the answer should be -1.

5. Account for the edge case when n = 1. If the only element is 1, then no operations are needed, and the answer is 0. If the only element is not 1, then it's impossible to make it 1, and the answer is -1.

6. The final step is to print the result stored in dp[0][n-1].
