Identify the minimum operations needed for each subarray to become 1, and use dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems.
dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations required to make all elements from the 1st to the i-th (inclusive) equal to 1.

The transition formula is as follows:
- If there exists a j (0 <= j < i) such that the gcd of any subarray from j+1 to i is 1, then dp[i] can be computed as dp[j] + (i - j - 1).
- Otherwise, if no such j exists, then it's not possible to make all elements up to i equal to 1, and dp[i] should be set to -1.

The base case is dp[0] = 0, as no operations are needed for an empty prefix.

The final answer will be dp[n] if dp[n] is not -1, otherwise, print -1 if it's not possible to make all elements equal to 1.

Potential issues and considerations:
- Ensure that the gcd computation is efficient to keep the overall complexity manageable.
- Handle the edge case where n = 1 separately, as only one operation is needed if the element is not already 1.
- The plan should consider that if at any point during the computation of dp[i], the gcd of the entire subarray [1, i] is 1, then dp[i] should be set to i - 1, as it would take i - 1 operations to make all elements equal to 1.
- The plan must consider that the array is not modifiable, and the operations are virtual, meaning we do not actually perform the gcd operations on the array but just calculate the minimum number of operations needed.
- The solution must handle cases where it is not possible to make all elements equal to 1, which occurs when the gcd of the entire array is greater than 1.
- The plan should include a check after computing all dp[i] values to determine if making all elements equal to 1 is possible, and if not, return -1.
