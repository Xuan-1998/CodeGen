Updated Plan:

1. Initialize an array dp[n+1] where dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations needed to make the subarray from 1 to i equal to 1, with dp[0] set to 0 and the rest set to a large number (e.g., n+1) to indicate that they are initially unreachable.

2. Iterate over the array from the 1st to the nth element. For each element at index i, do the following:
   a. Set dp[i] to min(dp[i], dp[i-1] + 1) because the worst case is to perform an operation on the (i-1)th and ith element to get gcd(1, a[i]) which is 1.
   b. Iterate over all previous elements from index j = i-1 down to 1 and do the following:
      i. Compute the gcd of the subarray from j to i. If the gcd becomes 1 before reaching the 1st element, update dp[i] to min(dp[i], dp[j-1] + 1) because we can make the subarray from j to i equal to 1 in one operation, and we add the operations needed to make the subarray from 1 to j-1 equal to 1.

3. After filling the dp array, if dp[n] is still a large number (e.g., n+1), it means it's not possible to make all elements of the array equal to 1; hence, print -1. Otherwise, print the value of dp[n] as it represents the minimum number of operations required.

4. To optimize the gcd computation, store the gcd of all subarrays ending at i in a separate array, and update it in each iteration when computing dp[i].

5. Handle edge cases such as an array with a single element (if it's 1, the answer is 0; otherwise, it's -1) and an array with all elements already equal to 1 (the answer is 0).

This plan avoids redundant computations by using dynamic programming and efficiently computes the gcd for subarrays using an additional array. It should be able to handle arrays up to the given constraint of 2000 elements.
