===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
1. Initialize a 3D array dp[i][j][g] to store the minimum number of operations required to make all elements from the i-th to the j-th (inclusive) equal to g, where g is the gcd of the subarray. Initialize all values to -1 or a large number to represent an unattainable state, except for dp[i][i][1] = 0 if arr[i] is 1, otherwise -1 for all i.

2. Define the state transition function:
   dp[i][j][g] = min(dp[i][k][h] + dp[k+1][j][h] + 1) for all k from i to j-1 and for all h which is the gcd of any subarray within [i, j]. The extra '+1' represents the operation of replacing two adjacent elements with their gcd.

3. The recurrence relation only works if we can combine two subarrays to form a larger subarray with all elements equal to 1. This is only possible if the gcd of the entire subarray [i, j] is 1. Therefore, we need a helper function to compute the gcd of any subarray in O(log(ai)) time.

4. Optimize the computation by only considering valid gcd values for subarrays. This can be achieved by precomputing all gcd values for subarrays starting at each index and using these values to restrict the range of h in the state transition function.

5. Use memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. The memo table is the dp array itself.

6. The answer to the problem will be dp[0][n-1][1], which represents the minimum number of operations required to make all elements from the 0-th to the (n-1)-th equal to 1. If this value is -1 or a large number, then it is not possible to make all elements of the array equal to 1, and we should return -1.

7. Handle edge cases:
   - If the array already consists of all 1s, no operation is needed, so return 0.
   - If there is at least one element that is not 1 and the gcd of the entire array is not 1, it is impossible to make all elements equal to 1, so return -1.

8. Implement the solution based on the above steps, ensuring that all indices and gcd computations are handled correctly to avoid out-of-bounds errors and incorrect gcd calculations.
