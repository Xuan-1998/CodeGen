===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
1. Initialize a 2D array dp[n][n], where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make all elements from the i-th to the j-th (inclusive) equal to 1.
2. Set the base case: for each i from 0 to n-1, if arr[i] is 1, then dp[i][i] = 0; otherwise, it is not possible to make a single element equal to 1, so dp[i][i] is not meaningful and can be ignored or set to a default value.
3. Iterate over all subarray lengths l from 2 to n:
   a. For each starting index i, calculate the ending index j = i + l - 1.
   b. Initialize dp[i][j] to a large number (e.g., infinity or a value larger than any possible number of operations).
   c. For each k from i to j-1, do the following:
      i. Calculate the gcd of the subarray [i, k] and the gcd of the subarray [k+1, j].
      ii. If the gcd of any of the two subarrays is 1, update dp[i][j] to the minimum of its current value and dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] (since combining a subarray with gcd 1 with any other subarray will result in a subarray with gcd 1).
4. The final answer is dp[0][n-1] if dp[0][n-1] is not infinity; otherwise, it is not possible to make all elements equal to 1, and the output should be -1.
5. Optimize the computation of gcd by using a gcd function that uses the Euclidean algorithm, which can compute the gcd in O(log(max(a, b))) time.
6. Handle edge cases such as when the array already consists of all 1s (in which case the answer is 0) or when there is no 1 in the array (in which case the answer might be -1 if no operations can lead to an array of all 1s).
