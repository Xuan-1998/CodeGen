===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
1. Initialize a 2D array dp[n][n] where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to reduce the elements from i to j to 1. If i == j, dp[i][j] = 0 since a single element is already equal to 1. If the GCD of elements at i and j is 1, then dp[i][j] = 1.

2. For each subarray length l from 2 to n:
   a. For each starting index i from 0 to n - l:
      i. Set the ending index j = i + l - 1.
      ii. Initialize dp[i][j] to a large number (e.g. infinity or a value greater than n).
      iii. For each possible split index k from i to j - 1:
         - Calculate the GCD of the subarray from i to k and the subarray from k+1 to j.
         - If the GCD of any of these two subarrays with the adjacent element is 1, update dp[i][j] to min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j]).

3. The final answer is dp[0][n-1] if dp[0][n-1] is not infinity, else return -1 if it is not possible to reduce the entire array to 1.

4. Edge cases:
   a. If the array contains a 1, the answer is 0 since no operations are needed.
   b. If the GCD of the entire array is greater than 1, it is impossible to reduce the array to all 1s, so return -1.

Note: The GCD of a subarray can be computed efficiently by iterating over the subarray and updating the GCD as new elements are considered. This can be done in O(n^2 * log(max(ai))) time for all subarrays.
