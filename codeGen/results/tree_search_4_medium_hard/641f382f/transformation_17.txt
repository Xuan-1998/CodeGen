Identify the minimum operations needed for each subarray to become 1, and use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to store the results of subproblems.

1. Initialize a 2D array dp[n][n], where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make all elements from the i-th to the j-th (inclusive) equal to 1. Initially, set all values of dp to a large number (e.g., infinity) to indicate that they have not been computed yet.

2. The base case is when i == j, which means the subarray contains only one element. In this case, dp[i][i] is 0 if the element is already 1, otherwise it's -1 as it's impossible to reduce a single number to 1 using the operation defined.

3. For each length of the subarray from 2 to n, do the following:
   a. For each starting index of the subarray, compute the minimum operations for the subarray ending at various positions using the following recurrence:
      dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + 1) for all i <= k < j,
      where the +1 accounts for the operation of taking GCD of elements at positions k and k+1.

4. We also need to consider the case where the GCD of a subarray is already 1. In such cases, we can set dp[i][j] to 0 as no operations are needed.

5. The answer to the problem is dp[0][n-1], which represents the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the entire array equal to 1.

6. If dp[0][n-1] is still set to a large number (e.g., infinity) after the computation, this means that it is impossible to make all elements equal to 1, and the output should be -1.

7. Optimize the computation of GCDs by storing previously calculated GCDs in a separate table to avoid redundant calculations.

8. Handle edge cases where the array contains only one element by directly checking if that element is 1 or not.

This plan ensures that all subproblems are solved in a bottom-up manner, and the results are combined to find the solution to the original problem. The optimization steps ensure that the algorithm is efficient and can handle the given constraints.
