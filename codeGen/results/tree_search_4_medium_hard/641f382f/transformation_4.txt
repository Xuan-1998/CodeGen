===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
1. Initialize a 2D array dp[i][j] to represent the minimum number of operations required to make all elements from the i-th to the j-th (inclusive) equal to 1. Initialize all values of dp[i][j] to a large number (e.g., infinity) except for dp[i][i] which should be 0 for all i.

2. For each subarray of length 2, calculate the gcd of its elements. If the gcd is 1, set dp[i][i+1] to 1; otherwise, set it to a large number (e.g., infinity).

3. Use a bottom-up approach to fill in the dp array. For each length L from 3 to n, and for each starting index i, calculate the minimum operations for subarray from i to i+L-1 by trying to split the subarray into two parts at every possible k (i < k < i+L-1) and taking the minimum of the sum of operations for the two parts plus the operation to combine them if the gcd of the entire subarray is 1. This is represented by:
   dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + 1) for all k where i < k < j and gcd(subarray[i...j]) == 1.

4. Calculate the gcd of subarrays dynamically to avoid recomputation. Store the gcd of all subarrays in a separate 2D array gcd[i][j] to use it in the dp transition.

5. The final answer is dp[1][n] if dp[1][n] is not equal to the large number used for initialization; otherwise, print -1 indicating it's not possible to make all the elements equal to 1.

6. Handle edge cases:
   a. If the array already contains a 1, the answer is 0 because no operations are needed.
   b. If the gcd of the entire array is greater than 1, immediately return -1 since it's not possible to make all elements equal to 1.

7. Optimize the gcd computation by using an efficient algorithm like Euclid's algorithm and memoize the results to avoid redundant calculations.

8. Ensure that the solution runs within the constraints, especially considering that the dp array can potentially have up to 2000^2 entries, which should be manageable within the memory limits.
