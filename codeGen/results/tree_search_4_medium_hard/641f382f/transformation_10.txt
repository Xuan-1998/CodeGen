===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
1. Initialize a two-dimensional array dp[n][n], where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make all elements from index i to j inclusive equal to 1. Initialize all values in dp to a large number (e.g., infinity or a number larger than the maximum possible number of operations) to represent an uncalculated state.

2. For each element in the array, set dp[i][i] to 0, as a single element can be considered as already reduced to 1 without any operations.

3. For each subarray length l from 2 to n:
    a. For each starting index i of the subarray:
        i. Set the ending index j of the subarray to i + l - 1.
        ii. Check if the subarray can be directly reduced to 1 by computing the GCD of all elements in the subarray. If the GCD is 1, set dp[i][j] to 0.
        iii. Otherwise, for each possible split k from i to j - 1, calculate the number of operations required to make the elements from i to k and from k+1 to j both equal to 1. Update dp[i][j] to the minimum of its current value and the sum of dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + 1 (the additional 1 is for the operation combining the two subarrays).

4. After filling the dp array, the answer is dp[0][n-1] if it is not infinity (or the large number used to initialize the dp array), otherwise print -1 if it is not possible to make all elements equal to 1.

5. Handle edge cases:
    a. If the entire array already has a GCD of 1, return 0 immediately without further computation.
    b. If any single element in the array is 1, then it is always possible to make the entire array equal to 1. Start the dp computation with this knowledge to optimize.

6. The time complexity of the solution is O(n^3 * log(max(ai))) due to the three nested loops for the dp computation and the GCD calculations.
