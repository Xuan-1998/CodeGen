===BEGIN UPDATED PLAN===
1. Initialize an array dp of size n+1 to store the minimum number of operations required to reduce the first i elements to 1, with the base case dp[0] = 0.

2. For each subarray starting at index i and ending at index j, calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the subarray. If the GCD is 1, then update dp[j+1] to be the minimum of its current value and dp[i] + 1. This reflects the minimum operations needed to make the subarray from i to j (inclusive) all equal to 1.

3. Implement the above step in a nested loop where the outer loop iterates over the starting index i of the subarray and the inner loop iterates over the ending index j of the subarray.

4. If after filling the dp array, dp[n] is still at its initial value (which should be set to a large number to reflect that it's not yet computed), then it's not possible to make all elements equal to 1 and the output should be -1.

5. Otherwise, the output is the value of dp[n], which represents the minimum number of operations required to make all elements equal to 1.

6. To handle the GCD calculations efficiently, a precomputed table or a function that calculates the GCD of a subarray using dynamic programming or prefix GCDs can be used to avoid redundant calculations.

7. Edge cases that should be considered include:
   - The array already consists of all 1s, in which case the output should be 0.
   - If any single element in the array is 1, then it's always possible to make the whole array 1 with at most n-1 operations by repeatedly taking GCD with this 1.

Note: The plan assumes that GCD calculations are efficient and do not significantly impact the overall time complexity of the solution, which is O(n^2) due to the nested loops for subarray calculations.
