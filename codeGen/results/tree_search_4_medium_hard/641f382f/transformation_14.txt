Identify the minimum operations needed for each subarray to become 1, and use a combination of dynamic programming approaches to solve the problem.
1. Initialize an array dp of size n+1, where dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations required to reduce the first i elements to 1, with the base case dp[0] = 0.
2. For each subarray starting from the first element to the ith element, calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the subarray. If the GCD is 1, compute the number of operations needed to reduce this subarray to 1.
3. The state of the dynamic programming solution is represented by dp[i], which gives the minimum number of operations to make the first i elements equal to 1.
4. The transition formula for the dynamic programming solution is dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1) for all j from 0 to i-1, if the GCD of elements from j+1 to i is 1.
5. Use a bottom-up approach with a table to fill in the values of dp[i] iteratively, starting from the base case and using the transition formula to compute the values for larger subarrays.
6. For subproblems that have not yet been computed, supplement the bottom-up approach with a top-down recursive call with memoization to avoid recomputation.
7. The final answer is dp[n] if dp[n] is not infinity; otherwise, print -1 if it is not possible to make all elements equal to 1.
8. Edge cases to consider include when the entire array's GCD is already 1, in which case no operations are needed, and when there are elements in the array that are already 1, which may reduce the number of operations required.
9. Ensure that the solution does not exceed the time complexity constraints by efficiently calculating the GCD of subarrays and by using memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
