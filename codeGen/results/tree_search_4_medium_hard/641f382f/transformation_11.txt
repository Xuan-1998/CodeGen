Identify the minimum operations needed for each subarray to become 1, and use dynamic programming with memoization to store the results of subproblems.
dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to reduce the elements from i to j to 1, with the base case dp[i][i] = 0 for all i.

The state transition is as follows:
For each subarray (i, j), we need to find the minimum number of operations to make all elements equal to 1. This can be computed using:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j]) for all k from i to j-1, where the elements at index i and k+1 can have a GCD of 1 after some operations.

To handle the case where the GCD of two elements is already 1, we need to check if any pair of adjacent elements has a GCD of 1. If so, we can immediately return the number of elements minus 1 as the result, since we can make all elements equal to 1 by performing n-1 operations, replacing the element next to the one with which it has a GCD of 1.

To optimize the computation of GCDs, we should preprocess the GCDs of all pairs of adjacent elements and store them in a 2D array gcd[i][j], where gcd[i][i+1] is the GCD of elements at index i and i+1. This array will be used within the dynamic programming state transitions to check if a subarray can be reduced to 1.

Use a 2D array for memoization where dp[i][j] stores the minimum operations to make the subarray from i to j equal to 1. Utilize this table in a bottom-up manner to find the minimum operations for the entire array.

The plan should also include an early termination condition: if at any point during the computation of dp[i][j], if we find a subarray that cannot be reduced to 1 (i.e., the GCD of the entire subarray is greater than 1 and no adjacent pairs have a GCD of 1), we should return -1 immediately.

The final answer will be the value of dp[0][n-1], which represents the minimum number of operations required to reduce the entire array to 1.

Potential issues with the plan include ensuring that the GCD computation is efficient and correctly implementing the memoization to avoid redundant calculations. Edge cases to consider are arrays with a single element (which is already 1) and arrays where no subarray can be reduced to 1.
