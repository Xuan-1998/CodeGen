Identify the minimum operations needed for each subarray to become 1, and use dynamic programming with memoization to store the results of subproblems.
dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to make all elements from the i-th to the j-th (inclusive) equal to 1, with the base case dp[i][i] = 0 for all i.
For each subarray (i, j), if the gcd of the entire subarray is 1, then dp[i][j] = 0. Otherwise, iterate over all possible splits (k) of the subarray and set dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + 1) if the gcd of elements from i to k and k+1 to j is 1.
Create a memoization map to store the results of subproblems (i, j) to avoid redundant calculations during the top-down approach.
Additionally, calculate the gcd of all possible subarrays in a preprocessing step and store the results in a separate array or matrix to avoid recalculating gcd during the dynamic programming phase.
Check if it is possible to make all elements of the array equal to 1 by ensuring there is at least one element in the array with a value of 1. If no such element exists, return -1 immediately.
Handle the edge case where n = 1. If the only element in the array is 1, return 0; otherwise, return -1.
Optimize the dynamic programming approach by considering that if a subarray has a gcd of 1, then any larger subarray containing it cannot have a gcd greater than 1, which may reduce the number of subproblems that need to be solved.
