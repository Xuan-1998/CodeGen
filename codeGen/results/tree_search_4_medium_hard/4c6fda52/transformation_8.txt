===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering all possible substrings of length k in s, and checking if they appear in the infinite string 'RGBRGBRGB...'.
The state expression is dp[i][c] = minimum number of characters changed in the first c characters of s, considering all substrings of length k ending at index i
dp[i][c] = min(dp[j-1][d] + (s[j] != target) for j in range(i, i-k+1), d in range(min(c, k)))
We use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming state and fill it up from top to bottom.
The base case is when c=k, which means we're considering the number of characters changed in the first k characters of s
dp[i][k] = min(dp[j-1][d] + (s[j] != target) for j in range(i-k+1), d in range(k))
We initialize dp[i][0] to 0, as changing no characters is always possible
The final answer is the minimum number of characters changed in all substrings ending at index n-1
min(dp[n-1][c] for c in range(1, k+1))
