A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 3D array dp where dp[i][j][k] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[max(0, i-k+1)..i+k-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' when considering only characters at positions i-k+1, ..., i. This value is then used to find the answer for each query.
dp[i][j][k] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[0..j] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' and dp[i-1][k-1][j-1] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[0..i+k-2] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'.
Use memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary, and reuse these results when solving larger subproblems.
For each query, initialize variables i and j such that s[i..j] is the substring we are considering for changes. Then, for each character at position p in this substring (from i to j), calculate dp[p][k-1][0] which represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[max(0, p-k+1)..p+k-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' when considering only characters at positions p-k+1, ..., p.
Add this value to the minimum number of changes needed for the previous character at position p-1 (if it exists), and subtract 1 if the current character at position p matches the corresponding character in 'RGBRGBRGB...'. This gives us dp[p][k-1][0].
Finally, return the sum of all these values for characters from i to j as the answer for this query.
