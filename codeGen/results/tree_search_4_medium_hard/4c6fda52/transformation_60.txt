===BEGIN PLAN===
A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to find a substring of length j in s[0...i]. 

The base case is when i < k, in which case we can simply return infinity because it's not possible to find a substring of length k in s[0...i].

For each state dp[i][j], we consider two options: 
1. The last character of the current substring matches the expected color (i.e., 'R' if j is odd, and 'B' if j is even). In this case, we can simply copy the value from the previous row dp[i-1][j].
2. The last character of the current substring does not match the expected color. In this case, we increment the minimum number of changes needed by 1.

The final answer would be dp[n][k], which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be changed in s so that a substring of length k can be found in s and also in an infinite string of "RGBRGBRGB...".
