===BEGIN PLAN===
A greedy approach can be used to solve this problem by iterating over the string s, and whenever a character is different from the expected one in the infinite string, incrementing a counter for the number of changes needed.

Consider dp[i][j] as true if substring s[i..i+k-1] is present in 'RGBRGBRGB...' string, where i ranges from 0 to n-k+1 and j ranges from 0 to k-1. We can use dynamic programming with memoization to solve the problem.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
