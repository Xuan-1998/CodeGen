===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] is true if substring s[i..i+k-1] is present in 'RGBRGBRGB...' string
Implement memoization using dictionary to store computed values
Create 2D array dp[n+1][k+1], where dp[i][0] = True for all i, and dp[0][j] = False for all j
Fill up the dp array by iterating over the string s from left to right
Whenever a mismatch is found with 'RGBRGBRGB...', increment counter for number of changes needed
The answer is the minimum number of characters that need to be changed in s
