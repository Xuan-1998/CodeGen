===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering all possible substrings of length k in s, and checking if they appear in the infinite string 'RGBRGBRGB...'.
The state expression is dp[i] = minimum number of characters changed in the first i+1 characters of s, considering all possible substrings of length k
dp[i] = minimum number of characters changed in the first i+1 characters of s, considering only the last character at index i and the previous state dp[i-1]
The dynamic programming approach can be used by identifying the overlapping subproblems:
	* Subproblem: Check if a substring of length k appears in 'RGBRGBRGB...'
	* Overlapping subproblems: If we've already checked for substrings ending at position i, we don't need to recheck them when checking for substrings ending at position i+1
The optimal substructure is also present:
	* The minimum number of characters changed in the first i+1 characters of s depends on the minimum number of characters changed in the first i characters of s, and the last character at index i
This plan correctly identifies the overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
To improve the plan, consider using a suffix tree or a rolling hash to efficiently check for substrings of length k in 'RGBRGBRGB...'
Potential issues with the plan include:
	* Edge cases: What if k is greater than the length of s? How do we handle this?
	* Corner case: What if all characters in s need to be changed to make a substring of length k appear in 'RGBRGBRGB...'?
To address these edge and corner cases, consider adding additional checks and handling mechanisms.
