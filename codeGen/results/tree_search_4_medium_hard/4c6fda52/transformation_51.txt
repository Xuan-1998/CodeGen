===BEGIN PLAN===
A greedy approach can be used to solve this problem by iterating over the string s, and whenever a character is different from the expected one in the infinite string, incrementing a counter for the number of changes needed.

Dp state: dp[i][c] = True if the first i characters of s can be extended to a string that includes the substring 'R'^(k-c) 'G'^(c) 'B'^((k-c))
Create a 2D table dp[n+1][3] where dp[i][j] is True if the first i characters of s can be extended to a string that includes the substring 'R'^(k-j) 'G'^(j) 'B'^((k-j)). Initialize dp[0][0] = True, and for each i from 1 to n, iterate over j from 0 to 2 and update dp[i][j] based on dp[i-1][(j+1)%3]. Update the counter if the characters at indices i-1 and k-1 are different. Finally, return the minimum number of changes needed.
