===BEGIN PLAN===
A greedy approach can be used to solve this problem by iterating over the string s, and whenever a character is different from the expected one in the infinite string, incrementing a counter for the number of changes needed.

Define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of characters that need to be changed in s[0...i-1] so that a substring of length j can be found in s[0...i-1] and also in an infinite string of 'RGBRGBRGB...'. Transition relationship: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j] + 1, dp[i-1][j+1]) + (s[i-1] != expected_color).

To avoid unnecessary computations and reduce time complexity, memoization can be used. Create a dictionary where the keys are tuples representing the current prefix index and substring length, and the values are the corresponding minimum number of changes.

The transition relationship is correct, but it's important to handle edge cases carefully. For example, what if j = 0? In this case, dp[i][j] should be 0 because an empty string can always be found in both s[0...i-1] and the infinite string.

To further improve the plan, consider precomputing some values to avoid unnecessary computations. For instance, for each prefix index i, precompute the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i-k+1...i] appear in both s[0...i] and the infinite string. This can be done by iterating over k from k-1 down to 0 and updating dp[i][k] accordingly.

The plan does not include edge cases for negative values of k, but these are easily handled by returning a large value (e.g., 2*10^5) when k is negative.
