A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing two 2D arrays dp and last where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[0..i+ j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', and last[i] represents the last character that should be changed in s[0..i] to extend it to 'RGBRGBRGB...' from left.

dp[i][j] is the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i-j+1..i+ j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'. This can be calculated by considering three options: 
- Make the current character in s the same as the corresponding character in 'RGBRGBRGB...', which requires no change if they are the same.
- Change the current character in s to match the corresponding character in 'RGBRGBRGB...' if it is different.
- Extend the previous calculation for dp[i-j][j] by one step, considering the characters in s[i-j..i] and 'RGBRGBRGB...' that should be changed to extend the substring from left.

Memoize dp values by storing them in a separate 2D array to avoid redundant calculations. 

last[i] is the last character that should be changed in s[0..i] to extend it to 'RGBRGBRGB...'. This can be calculated by considering two options: 
- Make the current character in s the same as the corresponding character in 'RGBRGBRGB...', which requires no change if they are the same.
- Change the current character in s to match the corresponding character in 'RGBRGBRGB...' if it is different. 

For each query, calculate dp[n][k] and then return k - dp[n][k] as the minimum number of characters that need to be changed.

This approach correctly solves the problem for all possible queries and includes edge cases.
