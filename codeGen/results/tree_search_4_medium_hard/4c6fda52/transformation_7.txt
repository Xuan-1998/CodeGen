===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering all possible substrings of length k in s, and checking if they appear in the infinite string 'RGBRGBRGB...'.

Let dp[i][c] = minimum number of characters changed in the first c characters of s, considering all substrings of length k ending at index i.

dp[i][0] = 0 for any i, as no changes are needed initially.
dp[0][c] = c if the substring s[0:k-1] does not appear in 'RGBRGBRGB...', and c otherwise.

For i > 0:
    - If s[i-k+1:i+1] appears in 'RGBRGBRGB...', then dp[i][c] = min(dp[i-1][c], 1) if the previous substring (s[i-k:i]) is not 'RGB', or dp[i-1][c] otherwise.
    - Otherwise, dp[i][c] = dp[i-1][c] + 1.

Let's say we have k = 3 and s = "RGB". Then:
    - dp[0][0] = 0
    - dp[1][0] = 0 (as 'RGB' appears in 'RGBRGB...')
    - dp[2][0] = 1 (as 'RBR' does not appear)
    - dp[3][0] = 2 (as 'RBG' does not appear, and we need to change the last character)

The answer for this query is min(dp[n-1][c], c) where n is the length of s.

This plan seems correct, but it can be optimized by using a more efficient data structure like a rolling hash or a Trie to check if substrings appear in 'RGBRGB...' efficiently.
