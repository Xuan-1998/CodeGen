A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[max(0, i-k+1)..i+k-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' when considering only characters at positions i-k+1, ..., i.

dp[0][j] = j if s[0..j-1] is a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'

for i from 1 to n-1:
    for j from 0 to min(i, k-1):
        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][k-j-1]+(s[i-k+1..i].count('R') + s[i-k+1..i].count('G') + s[i-k+1..i].count('B')))

return sum(dp[n-1][0] for _ in range(q))
