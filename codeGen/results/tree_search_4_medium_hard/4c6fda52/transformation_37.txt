===BEGIN PLAN===
A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'.

dp[0][j] = 0, for all j
dp[i][0] = i, for all i (because we need to change all characters in the first i characters)

For i > 0 and j > 0:
dp[i][j] is the minimum number of changes needed to extend the substring s[0..i-1] to s[0..i+j-1] and make it equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j]+1) if s[i-1] is different from the corresponding character in 'RGBRGBRGB...', otherwise dp[i-1][j]
This is because we have two choices: either match the last character of s with the corresponding character in 'RGBRGBRGB...' or change it, and then recursively apply this process for the rest of the string.

Use dynamic programming with bottom-up approach, filling up the dp table row by row.

For each query:
Find the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[0..k-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' using the dp array.
This is simply dp[n][k].
Return this value as the answer for the current query.
