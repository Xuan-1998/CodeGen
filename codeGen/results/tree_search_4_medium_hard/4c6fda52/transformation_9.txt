===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering all possible substrings of length k in s, and checking if they appear in the infinite string 'RGBRGBRGB...'.
The state expression is dp[i][c] = minimum number of characters changed in the first c characters of s, considering all substrings of length k ending at index i
dp[i][c] = min(dp[j-1][d] + (s[j] != target) for j in range(i-k+1, i+1), d in range(min(c+1, i-k+2)))
Using memoization with a dictionary to store the minimum number of characters changed for each substring.
For edge cases: If k > n, return n, since all substrings of length k will be found in the infinite string 'RGBRGBRGB...' and no changes are needed. If c < k, return c, since we only need to consider the first k characters of s.
