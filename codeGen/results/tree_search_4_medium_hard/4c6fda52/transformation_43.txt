A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[max(0, i-k+1)..i+k-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' when considering only characters at positions i-k+1, ..., i.

dp[i][j] is the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i-k+1..i+k-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' when considering only characters at positions i-k+1, ..., i

Use memoization with a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computation.

To improve this plan, we can consider using a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the minimum number of changes needed for each query. We can also use a sliding window approach to reduce the time complexity.

Potential issues with the plan include:

* Edge cases: The plan does not explicitly handle edge cases such as k being 0 or n being less than k.
* Incorrect calculation: The plan relies on the dynamic programming approach, but it's possible that the calculations for dp[i][j] are incorrect or incomplete.
