===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering all possible substrings of length k in s, and checking if they appear in the infinite string 'RGBRGBRGB...'.
The state expression is dp[i] = minimum number of characters changed in the first i+1 characters of s, considering all possible substrings of length k.
dp[i] = 0 if s[0:i+1] is equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', otherwise it's the minimum number of characters changed to make this true
To optimize the computation, consider using dynamic programming with bottom-up approach and a 2D table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of characters changed in the first i+1 characters of s, considering all possible substrings of length k that end at j.
For each character in s, update the dp table by checking if the substring ending at this position appears in 'RGBRGBRGB...'. If it does, set dp[i][j] to 0; otherwise, consider changing characters in the previous positions to make it appear.
Finally, return dp[n-1][n-1] as the minimum number of characters changed in s.
