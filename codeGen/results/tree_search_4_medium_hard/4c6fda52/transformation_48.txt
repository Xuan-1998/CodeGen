===BEGIN PLAN===
A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by considering dp[i][j] as true if substring s[i..i+k-1] is present in 'RGBRGBRGB...' string, where i ranges from 0 to n-k+1 and j ranges from 0 to k-1.

Use a 2D array with size (n-k+1) x k to store the dynamic programming state. Initialize all dp[i][j] as false initially.

For each substring s[i..i+k-1], consider three possibilities: 
1. The first character is 'R' and the rest of the substring matches 'RGB...'.
2. The first character is 'G' and the rest of the substring matches 'BGR...'.
3. The first character is 'B' and the rest of the substring matches 'RG...'.

Check if any of these conditions match, update dp[i][j] accordingly.

After filling up the 2D array, iterate over the last row (i.e., n-k+1 to n-1) and find the minimum number of characters that need to be changed in s so that a substring of length k can be found in s and also in an infinite string of "RGBRGBRGB...".
