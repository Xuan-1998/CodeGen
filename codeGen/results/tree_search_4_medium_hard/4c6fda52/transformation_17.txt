===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering all possible substrings of length k in s, and checking if they appear in the infinite string 'RGBRGBRGB...'.
Let dp[i] = minimum number of characters changed in the first i+1 characters of s, considering all possible substrings of length k that end at index i.
The recurrence relation is dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], 1 + dp[max(0, i-k)])
This is because if a substring of length k ending at i doesn't appear in the infinite string, then we need to change either the last character or one of the characters in the previous substring (if it exists).
The base case is dp[0] = 0, since there are no characters to change.
We use memoization by storing the values of dp[i] as they're calculated and returning them when needed.
Finally, we iterate through all indices i up to n-1, calculate dp[i], and return the minimum number of changes at index n-1.
