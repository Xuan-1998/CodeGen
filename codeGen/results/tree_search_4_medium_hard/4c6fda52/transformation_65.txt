===BEGIN PLAN===
A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by maintaining a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed in s[0...i] to find a substring of length j.
, 
Let dp[i][0] = i (base case), and for each character 'c' in s, update dp[i][j] as follows:
  - If c matches with the next expected character in the infinite string ('R', 'G', or 'B'), then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
  - Else, dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
Using this dynamic programming approach to precompute the number of changes needed for each substring of s.
