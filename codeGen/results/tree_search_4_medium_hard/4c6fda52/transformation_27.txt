===BEGIN PLAN===
A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', considering only characters at positions i, i+1, ..., i+j.

Create an additional 2D array prev where prev[i][j] stores the last character that needs to be added to s[i..i+j-1] to make it equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'.

Use dynamic programming to fill dp[][] and prev[][] arrays:

dp[0][0] = 0, since there are no characters to change

for i from 0 to n-1:
    for j from 1 to k+1:
        if s[i+(j-1)%3] is the same as prev[i-1][j-1]:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
        else:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1]+1, j)
        prev[i][j] = s[i+(j-1)%3]

The answer for a query is the value of dp[n-1][k].
