===BEGIN PLAN===
A greedy approach can be used to solve this problem by iterating over the string s, and whenever a character is different from the expected one in the infinite string, incrementing a counter for the number of changes needed.

Define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of characters that need to be changed in s[0...i-1] so that a substring of length j can be found in s[0...i-1] and also in an infinite string of 'RGBRGBRGB...'. Transition relationship: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j+1]) + (s[i-1] != expected_color).

Use a combination of tabulation and memoization to fill in the 2D table.

If s[0...k-1] contains a substring of length k that is also found in the infinite string, then the minimum number of changes needed is 0. Otherwise, increment the counter by 1 for each character in s[0...k-1] that does not match with the expected color in the infinite string.

Store the results in a dictionary for future reference.

For each query, iterate over the characters in s and update the minimum number of changes needed accordingly.

The time complexity is O(n*k) where n is the length of the string and k is the length of the substring. The space complexity is O(n*k).

This plan correctly captures the essence of the problem and provides a clear outline for solving it.
