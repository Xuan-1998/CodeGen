===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering all possible substrings of length k in s, and checking if they appear in the infinite string 'RGBRGBRGB...'.
The state expression is dp[i][j] = minimum number of characters changed up to index i in substring j, j+k-1
dp[i][j] = the minimum number of characters that need to be changed in s[:i+1] to make s[:i+1] a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', considering only the characters up to index i in the substring j, j+k-1. This state is determined by the characters at indices j and i.
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][min(j, k-1)] + (s[i] != 'RGB'[i%3]), dp[i-1][j]) if i >= 1 else 0,
The base case is when i < k. In this case, we need to change all characters in the substring j, j+k-1.
dp[i][j] = min(dp[k-1][k-1], sum(s[i:] != 'RGB'[i%3])) if i >= k else 0
The final answer is dp[n-1][0].
