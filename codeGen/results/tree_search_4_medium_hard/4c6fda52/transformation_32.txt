A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i-j+1..i] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'. 
The base case is when j = 0, in which case no characters need to be changed.
For j > 0, consider the last character in the substring. If it is different from the corresponding character in 'RGBRGBRGB...', then at least one change needs to be made. Consider all possible extensions of s[i-j..i] by adding 'R', 'G', or 'B' to the end. For each extension, calculate the minimum number of changes needed to make the extended substring equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'. The answer is the minimum over these possible extensions.
dp[i][j] is the minimum number of changes needed to extend the substring s[0..i-1] by j characters to match a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', 
Use a 2D array tabulation where tabulation[i][j] stores the number of ways to extend the substring s[0..i-1] by j characters to match a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', and then use this information to find the answer for each query.
For each query, calculate the minimum number of changes needed to make the first k characters in s equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'. This can be done by iterating over all possible extensions of the first k-1 characters in s and choosing the one that requires the fewest changes.
