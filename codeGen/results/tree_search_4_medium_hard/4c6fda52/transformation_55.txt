===BEGIN PLAN===
A greedy approach can be used to solve this problem by iterating over the string s, and whenever a character is different from the expected one in the infinite string, incrementing a counter for the number of changes needed.

Consider a dynamic programming approach where dp[i][j] is 1 if the substring s[i..i+k-1] (or its rotation) appears in the infinite string 'RGBRGB...' and 0 otherwise. Initialize a dictionary to store the results of subproblems.

For each i from 0 to n-k, iterate over j from 0 to k-1:
    For each character c in s[i..i+k-1], 
        if c is different from the expected one (R or G or B), increment the counter for the number of changes needed.
    Store dp[i][j] = counter as the result of subproblem (s[i..i+k-1]).

To find the minimum number of characters that need to be changed in s, iterate over i from 0 to n-k:
    For each substring s[i..i+k-1], calculate the number of changes needed as dp[i][k-1] - dp[i-1][k-1] (if i > 0).
    Update the minimum number of changes needed if necessary.

Return the minimum number of changes needed.
