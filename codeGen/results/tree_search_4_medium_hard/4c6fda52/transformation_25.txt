A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', and then using this information to find the answer for each query.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', considering only characters at positions i, i+1, ..., i+j-1
dp[i][0] = 0 for all i, as an empty string can be found in an infinite string of 'RGBRGBRGB...' (regardless of changes)
dp[0][j] = j for all j, as the first substring of length j cannot be found in an infinite string of 'RGBRGBRGB...' and j characters need to be changed

The base case is when i > 0 and j <= k. In this case, dp[i][j] can be calculated using the following formula:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1] + (s[i-1] != 'RGB'[i%3]), dp[i-1][j])

The reason is that if s[i-1] == 'RGB'[i%3], then we don't need to change anything. If s[i-1] != 'RGB'[i%3], then we need to change one character, and the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' is dp[i-1][j-1] + 1. If j <= k, then we can also consider not changing any characters in this case.

For queries where i > 0 and j > k, we use the following formula:

dp[i][j] = dp[i-k][k] + (s[i-k-1] != 'RGB'[i%3])

The reason is that if the substring s[i-k..i-1] can be found in an infinite string of 'RGBRGBRGB...', then the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' is the same as the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i-k..i-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', plus one (for the character at position i-k-1) if it's different from 'RGB'[i%3].

Finally, for each query, we calculate the answer as dp[n-1][k].
