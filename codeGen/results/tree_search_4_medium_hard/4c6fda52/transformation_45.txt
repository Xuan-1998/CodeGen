===BEGIN PLAN===
A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', and then using this information to find the answer for each query.

dp[i][j] is calculated as the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[max(0, i-k+1)..i+k-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' when considering only characters at positions i-k+1, ..., i. This calculation considers two possibilities:
- If the first character of the substring is different from the corresponding character in 'RGBRGBRGB...', then dp[i][j] is incremented by 1.
- If the first character of the substring matches the corresponding character in 'RGBRGBRGB...', then we recursively calculate dp[max(0, i-k+1)][k-1] and add it to dp[i][j].

The base case for this recursion is when j=k. In this case, dp[i][k] is set to 0 if the substring s[i..i+k-1] matches 'RGBRGBRGB...', and 1 otherwise.

To find the answer for each query, we iterate over all positions i in the string where a substring of length k can be found, and calculate dp[i][k]. The minimum value among these is the answer.
