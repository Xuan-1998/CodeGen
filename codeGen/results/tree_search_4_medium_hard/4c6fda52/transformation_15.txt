===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering all possible substrings of length k in s, and checking if they appear in the infinite string 'RGBRGBRGB...'.
The state expression is dp[i] = minimum number of characters changed to make the first i+1 characters of s equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', considering all possible substrings of length k.

dp[i] can be computed as follows:
- If i < k, then dp[i] is simply 0 because we haven't reached the minimum window size yet.
- If i >= k, then dp[i] = min(dp[i-k], c) where c is the number of characters that need to be changed in s[0:i+1] to make it equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'. This is because we have reached the minimum window size and we can either change some characters or keep them as they are.

Memoization can be implemented using a dictionary where dp[i] represents the minimum number of characters changed to make the first i+1 characters of s equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', considering all possible substrings of length k. The recursive function would check if the result is already computed and memoized, and return it if so.

The final answer can be computed as dp[n-1] where n is the length of s.
