A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', and then using this information to find the answer for each query.

dp[i][0] = 0, as an empty string can be made equal to an empty string by not changing anything

for i from k-1 down to 0:
    dp[i][j] is the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[max(0, i-k+1)..i+k-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' when considering only characters at positions i-k+1, ..., i
    if j == 0:
        dp[i][j] = 0, as an empty string can be made equal to an empty string by not changing anything
    else:
        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][max(0, j-1)], 1 + dp[i-1][min(j-1, k-1)])
        if s[i-k+1] != 'RGB'[i%3]:
            dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][min(j-1, k-1)]

dp[0][k-1] will be the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[0..k-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'
the answer for each query is the minimum number of characters that need to be changed in s to make it possible to find a substring of length k in both s and an infinite string of "RGBRGBRGB..."
