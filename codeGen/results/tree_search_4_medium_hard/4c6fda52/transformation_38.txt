===BEGIN PLAN===
A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'.

dp[i][0] = 0 (base case: an empty string needs no changes)
for j from 1 to k:
    for i from j to n-k+1:
        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1] + 1) if s[i-j+1..i] is equal to 'RGBRGBRGB...' at the same position
            else, dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1] + 1) + 1

To find the answer for each query, iterate through all possible substrings of length k in s and find the minimum number of changes needed to make it equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'. The minimum number of changes is then dp[n-k+1][k].

The time complexity is O(n * k) where n is the length of the string, because we are iterating through all possible substrings of length k in s. The space complexity is also O(n * k), as we need to store the dynamic programming values for each substring.
