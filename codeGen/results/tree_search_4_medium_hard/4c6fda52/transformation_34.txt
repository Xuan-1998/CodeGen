===BEGIN PLAN===
A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'. Then, using this information to find the answer for each query.

dp[i][j] is the minimum number of changes needed to extend the substring s[0..i-1] to s[0..i+j-1] and make it equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' where dp[i-1][j-1] represents the previous state. The base case would be dp[0][j] = j (since we need to change j characters in the initial string).

Tabulate the dp array by filling it up row by row starting from the first row:

dp[0][0] = 0
dp[0][1] = 1
...
dp[0][k-1] = k-1

dp[1][0] = 1 (since we need to change one character)
dp[1][1] = dp[0][1] + 1 (extend the previous row by 1)
...
dp[1][k-2] = dp[0][k-2] + 1

... (continue this process until the last row)

Finally, for each query, find the minimum number of changes needed to extend s[0..n-1] to s[0..n+k-1] and make it equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' which is dp[n][k].
