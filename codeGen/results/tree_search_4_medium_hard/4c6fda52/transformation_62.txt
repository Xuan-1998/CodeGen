===BEGIN PLAN===
A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by considering two states:
dp[i][j] and dp[i-1][j]. State dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed
to find a substring of length j in s[0...i], while state dp[i-1][j]
represents the same thing but for i-1 characters. Define dp[i][j] as the minimum
of these two states plus one if the current character does not match the expected
color (which is 'R' or 'G' or 'B' depending on whether the substring's length
is 3, 6, 9, etc.).

Let's start by initializing dp[0][0] = 0 and dp[0][j] = j for all j.
This means that if there are no characters in the string, we need to change at most j characters.

Then, iterate over the string s from left to right:
for i from 1 to n-1 (where n is the length of the string):
    for j from 0 to min(i, k) - 1:
        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j+1]) + (s[i] != s[i-j])
This line calculates the minimum number of changes needed
to find a substring of length j in s[0...i]. If s[i] does not match the expected color,
increment the count by 1.

Finally, return dp[n-1][k-1] as the result.
This is because we want to find the minimum number of changes
needed to find a substring of length k at the end of the string.
