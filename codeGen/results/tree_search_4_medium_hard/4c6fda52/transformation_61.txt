===BEGIN PLAN===
A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by iterating over the string s, and whenever a character is different from the expected one in the infinite string, updating the minimum number of changes needed.

Consider two states: dp[i][j] and dp[i-1][j]. State dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to find a substring of length j in s[0...i], while state dp[i-1][j] represents the same thing but for i-1 characters. Define dp[i][j] as the minimum of these two states plus one if the current character does not match the expected color.

To optimize, use memoization by storing the minimum number of changes needed for each substring in a dictionary.

Initialize the dictionary with base cases: dp[0][j] is 0 for all j, since an empty string can be found in any infinite string. Then, iterate over s and update the values in the dictionary accordingly.

Finally, return dp[n][k], which represents the minimum number of changes needed to find a substring of length k in the entire string.
