===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] is initialized as j for 0 <= i < n and 1 <= j <= k
For each position i and substring length j
    Calculate dp[i-1][j-1] if it exists, or calculate it from the base case of dp[0][j-1]
    If the current character s[i-1] matches with 'RGB' repeated j times at position i-j+1, then no change is needed and we update dp[i-1][j-1] as 0
    If the current character s[i-1] doesn't match, consider the three possible scenarios:
        - Change it to 'R'
        - Change it to 'G'
        - Change it to 'B'
    Choose the scenario that requires the minimum number of changes and update dp[i][j] accordingly
dp[0][k-1] is used as the base case for the dynamic programming table, which represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[0..k-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'
The answer for each query is the value in the dp table at position (n-k+1)[k-1]
