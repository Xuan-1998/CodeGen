A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[max(0, i-k+1)..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' when considering only characters at positions i-k+1, ..., i.

dp[i][0] = 0 for all i (base case)

For j > 0, dp[i][j] is the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[max(0, i-k+1)..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' when considering only characters at positions i-k+1, ..., i.

This can be computed using the following recurrence relation:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1

where k is the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[max(0, i-k+1)..i+k-2] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' when considering only characters at positions i-k+1, ..., i-1.

The answer for each query can be computed by finding the minimum value in dp[n-1][0..k-1].

The plan handles edge cases by initializing the base case correctly and considering all possible substrings.
