===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering all possible substrings of length k in s, and checking if they appear in the infinite string 'RGBRGBRGB...'.

dp[i] = minimum number of characters changed in the first i+1 characters of s, considering all possible substrings of length k

dp[i] = 0 if s[0:i+1] is equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', otherwise it's the minimum number of characters changed to make this true

To improve the plan:

* Instead of checking every possible substring of length k, we can only consider substrings that are palindromes (i.e., same when reversed). This reduces the number of subproblems significantly.
* To avoid redundant computations, we can use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and their corresponding values.

The updated plan:
