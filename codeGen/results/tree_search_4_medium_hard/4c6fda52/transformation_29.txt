A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'.
dp[0][j] = j, because we need to change all characters in the first j positions to make it equal to 'RGBRGBRGB...' when i = 0.
For each i and j, consider two cases:
    Case 1: The last character of s[i..i+j-1] is 'R'. Then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + (s[i-1] != 'G') because we need to change the last 'R' in s[i..i+j-1] into a 'B' and change all characters that are different from 'G' in the substring s[i-1..i+j-2].
    Case 2: The last character of s[i..i+j-1] is not 'R'. Then dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + (s[i-1] != 'G') because we have two options to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', and we need to change all characters that are different from 'G' in the substring.
Fill up the dp array using tabulation, starting from small values of j and moving towards larger values.
The answer for each query is dp[n-1][k].
