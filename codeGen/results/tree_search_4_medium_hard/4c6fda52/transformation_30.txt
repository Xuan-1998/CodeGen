===BEGIN PLAN===
A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[0..i-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' extended by j characters.
Create a 2D array dp of size (n + k) x (k + 1) and initialize it with zeros, where dp[i][j] will represent the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[0..i-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' extended by j characters.
Fill up the first column of the array: dp[i][0] = 0 for all i, because an empty string has no changes.
For each cell dp[i][j], calculate it based on the previous row and columns: 
    - If s[i-k..i-1] is equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' extended by j characters, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][k].
    - Otherwise, consider all possible extensions (R, G, or B) and choose the one that requires the minimum number of changes: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1] + |s[i-k..i-1]-c| for c in {'R', 'G', 'B'}).
Fill up the last column of the array: dp[n][k] will give us the answer for the current query.
For each query, output dp[n][k].
