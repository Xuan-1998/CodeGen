===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering all possible substrings of length k in s, and checking if they appear in the infinite string 'RGBRGBRGB...'.
The state expression is dp[i][c] = minimum number of characters changed in the first c characters of s, considering all substrings of length k ending at index i.
dp[i][c] = 0 if there's no need to change any characters, and c is the number of characters changed so far.
Initialize a 2D array dp with dimensions (n, k+1), where n is the length of the string s, and fill it with values based on whether each substring appears in 'RGBRGBRGB...'.
Use a variable prev_color to keep track of the previous color seen in the infinite string, and update dp[i][c] accordingly.
dp[n-1][k] will be the minimum number of characters that need to be changed in s so that a substring of length k can be found in s and also in an infinite string of "RGBRGBRGB...".
