===BEGIN PLAN===
A greedy approach can be used to solve this problem by iterating over the string s, and whenever a character is different from the expected one in the infinite string, incrementing a counter for the number of changes needed. 

Let dp[i][j] be the number of changes needed to find a substring of length j in s[0...i]. Transition relationship: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][min(j-1, k)]) + (s[i-1] != 'RGB'[j%3]).

Using a dictionary to memoize the dynamic programming table, with n as the key and a list of values representing the number of changes needed for each substring length up to k. 

For each query, iterate over s from left to right, updating dp[i][j] accordingly. The minimum number of changes needed is then dp[n-1][k].
