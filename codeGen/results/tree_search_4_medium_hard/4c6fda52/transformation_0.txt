===BEGIN PLAN===
dp = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]

The problem can be solved by building up from the bottom (smaller substrings) to the top (larger substrings).
For each index i and substring j, we check if s[i-j:i] appears in 'RGBRGBRGB...'. 
If it does, then dp[i][j] = 0, as no characters need to be changed. 
Otherwise, we consider two cases:
1. If the first character of the substring is 'R', then we can make it appear by changing all 'B's before index j into 'G's.
2. If the first character of the substring is not 'R', then we can make it appear by changing all 'G's and 'B's before index j into 'R's.

So, dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][max(0, j-2)], dp[i-1][min(n-1, j+1)] + (s[j] != s[i-j])) 

This plan correctly breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems and uses a dynamic programming approach to solve it. The potential issues with this plan are:
* Edge cases: For edge case where i is less than k, dp[i][j] = 0 if j is less than k, otherwise dp[i][j] = min(dp[0][0], dp[i-1][k-1]) + (s[j] != s[k-j]).
* Corner case: When j+k-1 is greater than n, we can't check the substring at index i. So, we need to handle this case separately.
