===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering all possible substrings of length k in s, and checking if they appear in the infinite string 'RGBRGBRGB...'.
The state expression is dp[i][j] = minimum number of characters changed up to index i in substring j, j+k-1
dp[i][j] = 0 if s[j:j+k] is not a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' and dp[i-1][0], since the problem only requires considering substrings in s[:i+1]
Use memoization with dictionary to store intermediate results.
For each query, iterate over all possible j such that j + k - 1 <= n, and update dp[i][j] accordingly
Finally, return min(dp[n-1][0], ..., dp[n-k][n-k-1])
