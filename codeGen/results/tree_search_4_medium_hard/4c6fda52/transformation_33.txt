===BEGIN PLAN===
A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'. 

dp[0][j] = j for all 0 <= j < k, since we need to change the first k characters in s.
For i > 0 and 0 <= j <= k:
    dp[i][j] is the minimum number of changes needed to extend the substring s[0..i-1] to s[0..i+j-1] and make it equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'
    If s[i-1] == s[i+k-1], then we don't need to change this character, so dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], 1 + dp[i-1][k-j]) 
    Otherwise, we need to change it, so dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][k-j])
Memoize the states dp[i][0], 0 <= i < n, and then fill up the rest of the dp array
Finally, the answer for each query is dp[n-1][k-1]
