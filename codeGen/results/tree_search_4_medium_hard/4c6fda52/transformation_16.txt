===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering all possible substrings of length k in s, and checking if they appear in the infinite string 'RGBRGBRGB...'.
The state expression is dp[i] = minimum number of characters changed in the first i+1 characters of s, considering all possible substrings of length k
dp[i] = minimum number of characters changed in the first i+1 characters of s, considering only the last character at index i and the previous state dp[i-1]
Consider using a table to store the minimum number of characters changed for each prefix of the string
Let's use a dynamic programming approach:
dp[0] = 0 (base case)
For i from 1 to n-1:
    if s[i-k+1..i] is in the infinite string 'RGBRGBRGB...':
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-1])
    else:
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-1] + 1)
Return dp[n-1]
