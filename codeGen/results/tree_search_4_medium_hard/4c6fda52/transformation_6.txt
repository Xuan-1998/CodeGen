===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering all possible substrings of length k in s, and checking if they appear in the infinite string 'RGBRGBRGB...'.



state expression: dp[i][c] = minimum number of characters changed in the first c characters of s, considering all substrings of length k ending at index i
    dp[i][c] = 1 if the substring s[i-k+1:i+1] appears in 'RGBRGBRGB...', 0 otherwise, and c is the number of characters changed so far.
initialization: dp[0][0] = 0 (since no changes are needed initially)
for i from k-1 to n-1:
    for c from 0 to min(k-1, i-k+1):
        if s[i-k+1:i+1] appears in 'RGBRGBRGB...':
            dp[i][c] = min(dp[i-1][c], 1 + dp[i-1][c-1])
        else:
            dp[i][c] = 1 + dp[i-1][c]
return dp[n-1][k-1]
