===BEGIN PLAN===
A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', and then using this information to find the answer for each query.

dp[i][j] is the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[max(0, i-k+1)..i+k-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' when considering only characters at positions i-k+1, ..., i

To calculate dp[i][j], consider the following cases:

* If j == 0, then dp[i][j] is always 0
* If s[i] is equal to 'R', 'G', or 'B' and s[i-1] is not equal to 'R', 'G', or 'B', then dp[i][j] is dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 (add one change)
* If s[i] is equal to 'R', 'G', or 'B' and s[i-1] is equal to 'R', 'G', or 'B', then dp[i][j] is dp[i-1][j-1]

Memoize the results of subproblems by storing them in a 2D array dp

To find the answer for each query, iterate through the string and calculate dp[n][k], where n is the length of the string and k is the desired substring length. The minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[0..n-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' is dp[n-1][k-1]
