===BEGIN PLAN===
A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem where dp[i][j] is 1 if the substring s[i..i+k-1] (or its rotation) appears in the infinite string 'RGBRGB...' and 0 otherwise.

Let's initialize a 2D table with size n x k, filled with -1. For each i from 0 to n-k+1:
    For each j from 0 to k-1:
        If s[i+j] is equal to 'R' or 'G' or 'B', then dp[i][j] will be 1 if the substring s[0..k-1] (or its rotation) appears in the infinite string 'RGBRGB...' and 0 otherwise.

The minimum number of characters that need to be changed can be calculated by iterating over the table and finding the maximum value. The maximum value represents the minimum number of changes needed.
