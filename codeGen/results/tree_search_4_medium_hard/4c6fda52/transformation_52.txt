===BEGIN PLAN===
A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by iterating over the string s and maintaining a dp array where dp[i][c] is True if the first i characters of s can be extended to a string that includes the substring 'R'^(k-c) 'G'^(c) 'B'^((k-1)-c).

We start with initializing an empty dictionary memo, and then we define a function f(s, k) that returns the minimum number of characters that need to be changed in s so that a substring of length k can be found in s and also in an infinite string of "RGB".

Then, for each character in s, if the character matches the expected one in the infinite string (i.e., 'R' when c is even, 'G' when c is odd), we update dp[i][c] to True. If not, we update dp[i][c] to False.

Finally, we return 0 if dp[n][k] is True, and otherwise, we recursively call f(s[:i], k) for each i such that s[:i] does not contain the substring 'R'^(k-1) 'G'^((k-1)/2) 'B'^(k/2), until we reach the base case where dp[0][c] is True.

We use memoization to store the results of subproblems in a dictionary and avoid recomputing the same subproblem multiple times. This ensures that our solution runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of s.
