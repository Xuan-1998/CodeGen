A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', considering only characters at positions i, i+1, ..., i+j.

dp[0][k] = 0 (base case)
For j from 1 to k:
    dp[i][j] = minimum number of changes needed for s[i..i+j-1]
        if s[i-1] is equal to the corresponding character in 'RGBRGBRGB...', then it doesn't need to be changed
        else, add 1 to the number of changes needed for s[i-1..i+j-2]

For each query:
    Find dp[n][k], where n is the length of the string

This plan should work correctly and efficiently. It takes into account edge cases (like when k = 0) by initializing the base case correctly.
