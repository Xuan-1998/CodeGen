===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] be the number of changes needed to find a substring of length j in s[0...i].
Transition relationship: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1]) + (s[i-1] != 'RGB'[j%3]).
Using a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table, with n rows and k columns.
For each query, compute the minimum number of changes needed by iterating over all substrings of length k in s and using the dp table.
Let's initialize the dp table as follows:
dp[0][j] = 0 for j = 1 to k-1
dp[i][0] = i for i = 1 to n-1
Fill up the dp table row by row from left to right, ensuring that each cell value is computed using its predecessor values.
Finally, return the minimum value in the last column of the dp table, which represents the minimum number of changes needed.
