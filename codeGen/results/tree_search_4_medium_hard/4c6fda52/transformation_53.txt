===BEGIN PLAN===
A greedy approach can be used to solve this problem by iterating over the string s, and whenever a character is different from the expected one in the infinite string, incrementing a counter for the number of changes needed.

Dp state: dp[i][c] = True if the first i characters of s can be extended to a string that includes the substring 'R'^(k-c) 'G'^(c) 'B'^((k-1)-c)
Create a 2D table dp[n+1][3] where dp[i][0] is the minimum number of characters that need to be changed in the first i characters of s so that a substring of length k can be found in s and also in an infinite string of 'RGB'. Initialize dp[0][c] = 0 for c=0,1,2. 
For each i from 1 to n:
    - For each j from 0 to 2: 
        * If the character at position i-1 is different from the expected one ('R' if j==0, 'G' if j==1, 'B' if j==2), update dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][c] + 1 for c in [0,1,2] where c!=j) + 1
        * Else, update dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
    - The answer is the minimum value of all values in dp[n][0], dp[n][1], and dp[n][2]
