===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering all possible substrings of length k in s, and checking if they appear in the infinite string 'RGBRGBRGB...'.
The state expression is dp[i][j] = minimum number of characters changed up to index i in substring j, j+k-1
dp[i][j] = 0 if s[j:j+k] is not a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' and the minimum number of characters that need to be changed in s[:i+1] to make s[:i+1] a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', considering only the characters up to index i-1. This state is determined by dp[i-1][0], j, k.
Use dynamic programming with 3D table and iterate over the string in reverse order.
dp[i][j][c] = minimum number of characters changed up to index i in substring j, j+k-1 considering c color changes (R, G or B)
dp[i][j][c] = 0 if s[j:j+k] is not a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' and the minimum number of characters that need to be changed in s[:i+1] to make s[:i+1] a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', considering only the characters up to index i-1 and c color changes. This state is determined by dp[i-1][0], j, k, c.
dp[i][j][c] = min(dp[i-1][m][n]) + 1 if s[j:j+k] is a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' with c color changes
For each i from n-1 to 0 and for each j from 0 to n-k+1:
    For each c from 0 to k:
        dp[i][j][c] = min(dp[i-1][m][n]) + 1 if s[j:j+k] is a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' with c color changes
    The minimum number of characters that need to be changed in s[:i+1] to make s[:i+1] a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', considering only the characters up to index i-1 and c color changes.
The final answer is dp[0][0][0]
