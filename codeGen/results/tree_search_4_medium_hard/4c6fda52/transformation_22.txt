===BEGIN PLAN===
A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'. Then, we use this information to find the answer for each query.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', considering only characters at positions i, i+1, ..., i+j.

To fill up the dp array, we can iterate over all possible substrings of s and for each substring, we can calculate the minimum number of changes needed to make it equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'. This calculation involves comparing characters at corresponding positions in both strings and counting the number of mismatched characters.

For each query, we find the minimum number of changes needed to make a substring of length k equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' by looking up the value in the dp array. This value corresponds to the minimum number of changes needed to make the entire string s equal to 'RGBRGBRGB...'.
