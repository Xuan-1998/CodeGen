A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', and then using this information to find the answer for each query.

dp[i][0] is always 0, as an empty substring can be found in an infinite string of 'RGBRGBRGB...'.
For j > 0, dp[i][j] is calculated based on the previous j-1 characters. If s[i+j-1] is equal to 'R' and s[i+j-k-1] is equal to 'B', or if s[i+j-1] is equal to 'G' and s[i+j-k-1] is equal to 'R', then dp[i][j] is the minimum of dp[i+1][j-1] + 1 (if a change needs to be made at position i) and dp[i][j-1].
Otherwise, dp[i][j] is just dp[i][j-1].

The answer for each query can then be found by calculating dp[n-k][k], as this represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[n-k..n-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...'.

Initialize dp[0][j] for all 0 <= j <= k.
Fill up dp[][] in a bottom-up manner, from left to right and from top to bottom.
The time complexity is O(nk) where n is the length of string s and k is the query value, as each cell in the dp array needs to be filled once.
