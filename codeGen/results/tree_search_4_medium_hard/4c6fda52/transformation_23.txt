===BEGIN PLAN===
A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', considering only characters at positions i, i+1, ..., i+j.

We can initialize the first row and column of dp[][] based on some recurrence relation. For example, we can consider that if the current character matches with the next "RGB" string, then no changes are needed; otherwise, one change is needed.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1] + (s[i] != 'R' && s[i] != 'G' ? 1 : 0))

This recurrence relation takes into account the previous characters in the string and the current character, considering that if it matches with the next "RGB" string, no changes are needed.

We can fill up the rest of the 2D array dp[][] based on this recurrence relation. Finally, we can use this information to find the answer for each query by summing up the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[0..k-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...' considering only characters at positions 0, 1, ..., k.
