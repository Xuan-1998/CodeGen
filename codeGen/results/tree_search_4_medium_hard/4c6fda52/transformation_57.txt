===BEGIN PLAN===
A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by defining dp[i][j] as the minimum number of characters that need to be changed in s[0...i-1] so that a substring of length j can be found in s[0...i-1] and also in an infinite string of 'RGBRGBRGB...' with expected color.

Transition relationship:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j] + 1, dp[i-1][j+1]) + (s[i-1] != expected_color)

The initial state is dp[0][k] = k - 1 (since we need to change the first k characters in the infinite string), and the base case is when j > i or j < 0.

Use bottom-up dynamic programming to fill in a 2D table with the minimum number of changes needed for each prefix of the string and each possible substring length. The final answer is dp[n-1][k].

This plan correctly captures the problem's essence, but it can be improved by considering the fact that we only care about the characters in s[0...n-1] when calculating dp[i][j]. This allows us to reduce the state space and improve the time complexity.
