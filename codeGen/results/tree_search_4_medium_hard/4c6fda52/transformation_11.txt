The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering all possible substrings of length k in s, and checking if they appear in the infinite string 'RGBRGBRGB...'.
The state expression is dp[i][c] = minimum number of characters changed in the first c characters of s, considering all substrings of length k ending at index i
dp[i][c] = min(dp[max(0, j-k)]:j in range(i-k+1, i+1)) + (s[i] != target)
The base case is dp[0][c] = 0 for c in range(c+1), since the first c characters are already considered as part of the initial string.
Using a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table and filling it up from bottom to top, with dp[i][c] being calculated based on dp[j][d-1] for j < i-k and d < c. This way, we avoid redundant calculations.
The answer is then the minimum value in the last column of the 2D array, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be changed in s so that a substring of length k can be found in s and also in an infinite string of "RGBRGBRGB...".
