===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering all possible substrings of length k in s, and checking if they appear in the infinite string 'RGBRGBRGB...'.

Let dp[i][c] = minimum number of characters changed in the first c characters of s, considering all substrings of length k ending at index i

The state transition can be described as follows:
dp[i][c] = min(dp[j][d-1] + (s[j+k-1] != target)) for d in range(c+1) and j in range(max(0, i-k), i)

Employing both tabulation and memoization techniques to take advantage of their respective strengths.

To initialize the dynamic programming table, we need to consider all substrings of length k ending at index 0.
dp[0][c] = c if s[0..k-1] != "RGB" * k
dp[0][c] = 0 otherwise

The final answer will be dp[n][3], where n is the length of the string s.

Note: The target sequence for substring matching can be either "RGB" or "BGR".
