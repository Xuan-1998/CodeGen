A dynamic programming approach can be used to solve this problem by constructing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the substring s[i..i+j-1] equal to a substring of 'RGBRGBRGB...', considering only characters at positions i, i+1, ..., i+j.

dp[0][j] is initialized as j because it takes j operations to change all characters in the first j positions to 'RGBRGBRGB...'. Then, for each position i from 1 to n-k+1:

* dp[i][0] is initialized as 0 because there are no characters to consider.
* For each position j from 1 to k:
    + If s[i+j-1] == 'R' and dp[i][j-1] > dp[i-1][k-j], then dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][k-j]) because it's more efficient to change the last character in the current substring to match the characters at position i+j-1.
    + Else, dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1].
* The answer for each query is then the minimum of dp[n-k][0] and k because either we need to make all characters up to the length of the query equal or change some characters in the middle.

This plan can be improved by using memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid repeated computations.
