===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering all possible substrings of length k in s, and checking if they appear in the infinite string 'RGBRGBRGB...'.
The state expression is dp[i][c] = minimum number of characters changed in the first c characters of s, considering all substrings of length k ending at index i
dp[i][c] = min(dp[j-1][d] + (s[j] != target) for j in range(i, i-k, -1), d in range(c+1))
Using a monotonic queue to keep track of the ending indices of substrings that appear in the infinite string.
The queue will be updated as follows:
    - For each substring of length k ending at index i:
        - Check if the substring appears in the infinite string. If it does, update the queue with the current ending index i
        - Update dp[i][c] to be the minimum number of characters changed in the first c characters of s, considering all substrings of length k ending at index i
    - Use the updated queue and state expression to find the minimum number of characters that need to be changed in s so that a substring of length k can be found in s and also in an infinite string of "RGBRGBRGB..."
