The key insight is that the optimal solution for a given length j can be computed from the optimal solutions for lengths j-1 and j-2. Specifically, if s[:k] is the optimal string of length k, then either s[:k+1] (by adding one more character) or s[:k-1] (by removing the last character) could be the optimal solution for length k+1.

State expression: dp[i][j] is a 2D array that stores all strings of length j that can be formed by doing operations on the first i characters of s, ordered lexicographically. Initially, only dp[0][0] is known (the empty string).

State transition: For each i from 1 to n and j from 1 to k, compute dp[i][j] as the concatenation of the smallest strings in dp[i-1][j-1] and s[i-1:i], or removing the last character from dp[i][j-1].

Base case: When j is equal to k, return the smallest string in dp[n][k], which represents all possible strings of length k that can be formed by doing operations on the first n characters of s.

Memoization: Use a hash map to store and retrieve previously computed values. This allows us to avoid recomputing the same values multiple times.

Return statement: Return the smallest string in dp[n][k] as the lexicographically smallest string of length k that can be obtained by doing operations on s.
