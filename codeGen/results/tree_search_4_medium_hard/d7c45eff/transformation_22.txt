===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] = the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained from s[:i] with exactly j characters.

dp[i][0] = if i == 0, then return an empty string; else, return the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by deleting the last character of dp[i-1][0].

dp[i][j] = if j > n - i + 1, then duplicate s[:i] until we reach a length of j; else, return the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by deleting the last character of dp[i][j-1].

Consider edge cases: 
* If k > n, then the optimal solution is to duplicate the string until we reach a length of k.
* If k == 0, then the optimal solution is an empty string.
