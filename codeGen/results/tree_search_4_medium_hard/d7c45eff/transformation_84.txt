===BEGIN PLAN===
The plan is correct in the sense that it's trying to use dynamic programming to solve this problem. However, there are some potential issues with the plan.

To improve the plan, let's break down the problem further. The state transition can be defined as follows: if we have a string of length i and we want to get a string of length j (j >= i), we can either delete the last character or duplicate the original string. This means that dp[i][j] would depend on dp[i-1][j-1] and/or dp[0][j-i].

The updated plan is as follows:
