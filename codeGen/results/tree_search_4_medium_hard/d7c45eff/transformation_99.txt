The key insight is that the optimal solution for a given length j can be computed from the optimal solutions for lengths j-1 and j-2. Specifically, if s[:k] is the optimal string of length k, then either s[:k+1] (by adding one more character) or s[:k-1] (by removing the last character) could be the optimal solution for length k+1.

State expression: dp[i][j] represents the lexicographically smallest string of length j that can be obtained by duplicating or deleting characters from s[:i].

Initialization: dp[0][0] = True, since an empty string is the lexicographically smallest of all strings.

Transition function:
dp[i][j] = any dp[i-1][j-1] and (s[j-1] <= s[-1] or j == k)

dp[i][k] = True if there exists a substring s[:i] such that len(s[:i]) == k, and s[k-1] <= s[-1], dp[i-1][k-1]
Otherwise, False

Final answer: dp[n][k]
