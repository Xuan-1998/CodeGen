===BEGIN PLAN===
DP state representation: A tuple (s, deleted) where s is the current string and deleted is a boolean indicating whether the last character was deleted.

Initialization:
- Create a dictionary memo initialized with default values for states representing empty strings (s = "", deleted = False)
- Initialize an array dp of length k + 1 with default values

Transition function:
- For each state (s, deleted), consider two options: 
    - Delete the last character if s has more than one character and deleted is True
    - Duplicate the original string if s has exactly k characters or it's the first step
- Calculate the lexicographically smallest string for each option and update memo[(s, deleted)] accordingly

Final answer:
- Return the lexicographically smallest string in memo that corresponds to a state where s has exactly k characters and deleted is False

Edge cases:
- Handle the case where s is an empty string by returning the default value
- Handle the case where k is 0 or less by returning an empty string
