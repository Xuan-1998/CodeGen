===BEGIN PLAN===
The key insight is that the optimal solution for a given length j can be computed from the optimal solutions for lengths j-1 and j-2. Specifically, if s[:k] is the optimal string of length k, then either s[:k+1] (by adding one more character) or s[:k-1] (by removing the last character) could be the optimal solution for length k+1.

State expression: dp[j] is a boolean array where dp[j] = True if the lexicographically smallest string of length j can be obtained by duplicating s[:i], and False otherwise. This ensures that only unique strings are considered, so the problem reduces to finding the first occurrence of a duplicate string (which would mean it's not possible to get a lexicographically smaller string).

dp[j] = any s[:i] such that len(s[:i]) == j-1, and s[j-1] <= s[-1], dp[j-1]

Implement dynamic programming using a monotonically increasing variable, where dp[j] depends only on dp[j-1] and dp[j-2]. This means that for each length j, we only need to consider the strings of lengths j-1 and j-2.

This plan is correct in its approach. However, there's one important consideration: what if s[:j-1] ends with a character that is greater than or equal to the last character of s? In this case, the optimal solution for length j would be obtained by duplicating s[:j-2], not s[:j-1]. So we need to handle this edge case.

To do this, we can modify the state expression as follows:

dp[j] = any s[:i] such that len(s[:i]) == j-1 and s[j-1] <= s[-1], dp[j-2] or len(s[:i]) == j-2, dp[j-2]

This ensures that we consider all possible strings of lengths j-1 and j-2 and choose the one that results in a lexicographically smaller string.
