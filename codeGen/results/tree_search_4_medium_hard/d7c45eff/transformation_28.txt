===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming, consider all possible strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string, and then try to find the lexicographically smallest one among them. This way, you can avoid re-computing the same subproblems multiple times.

state
Choose a set of states to represent possible strings that have been formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string.

states = [""] + [s[i:][::-1] for i in range(n)]
The states include the empty string and all reversed suffixes of the original string. This is because you can always get a shorter string by deleting characters from the end of a longer string, or by duplicating a shorter string to make it longer.

transition
Define transitions between these states that describe how you can move from one state to another. For example, if you're in state s[i:], you can either delete the last character to get s[:i-1], or duplicate the string to get s[i:][::-1].

def transition(s):
    if len(s) > 0:
        return [s[:-1], s + s]
    else:
        return [""]

memoization
Use a dictionary to store the results of sub-problems, so that when you encounter the same subproblem again, you can just look up the result in the dictionary rather than re-computing it.

dp = {}

answer
Finally, start from the initial state (the original string) and use the transitions to find all possible strings of length k. Then, return the lexicographically smallest one among them.

def answer(n, k):
    current_state = [s for _ in range(len(s))]
    min_str = ""
    
    for i in range(k):
        next_states = transition(current_state)
        min_str = min(min_str, ''.join(sorted(next_states)))
        current_state = next_states
    
    return min_str
