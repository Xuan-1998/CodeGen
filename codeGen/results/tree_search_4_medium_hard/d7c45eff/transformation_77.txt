===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about how you can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. You can consider all possible strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string, and then try to find the lexicographically smallest one among them.

Let's define a state as a tuple containing the current string and its length. The transition relationships could be formulated by iterating over all possible operations (deleting the last character or duplicating the string) and checking if the resulting string is lexicographically smaller than the current one.

Create a 2D DP table where each cell dp[i][j] represents the lexicographically smallest string of length j that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string, considering the first i characters. Initialize all cells to an empty string initially.

For each cell dp[i][j], iterate over all possible strings s' of length j-1 (which can be obtained by deleting the last character or duplicating the string) that end with a character c at index i. For each such string s', check if the resulting string s+c is lexicographically smaller than dp[i-1][j-1]. If it is, update dp[i][j] to be this new string.

Finally, return dp[n][k], which represents the lexicographically smallest string of length k that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string, considering the entire input string s.
