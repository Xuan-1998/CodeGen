Define a state as the number of times the original string is duplicated up to now. The transition relationships can be defined based on whether the current duplication count plus one would exceed k.

Consider the following states and transitions:
- dp[i][0] represents the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by duplicating the original string i times, with a length of 0.
    + Transition: If the last character is not deleted, consider all strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the string. 
- dp[i][j] represents the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by duplicating the original string i times, with a length of j.

For each state and transition:
    + If the current duplication count plus one would exceed k, consider only strings that can be formed by deleting the last character.
    + Else, consider all strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the string.

The base case is when i = 0. In this case, dp[0][j] represents the lexicographically smallest string of length j that can be formed by deleting characters from the original string.
    + Transition: If the current duplication count plus one would exceed k, consider only strings that can be form
