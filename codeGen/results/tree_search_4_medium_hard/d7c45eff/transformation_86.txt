===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider all possible strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string. This way, you can avoid re-computing the same subproblems multiple times.

Let's define a set of states as all possible strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string s.

Define a function f(s, k) that returns the lexicographically smallest string of length k by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string s, and use it as the base case in your dynamic programming solution.

To fill up the DP table, for each possible substring s[0...i], where 0 <= i < n-1, you can calculate the lexicographically smallest string of length k by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string s[0...i].

For the base case, when k = 1, return the first character of the string s if it exists.

To fill up the DP table for each possible substring s[0...i], where 0 <= i < n-1, you can iterate over all possible substrings and calculate the lexicographically smallest string of length k by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string s[0...i].

Finally, return f(s, k) as the result.
