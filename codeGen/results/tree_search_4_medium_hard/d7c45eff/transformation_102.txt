The key insight is that the optimal solution for a given length j can be computed from the optimal solutions for lengths j-1 and j-2. Specifically, if s[:k] is the optimal string of length k, then either s[:k+1] (by adding one more character) or s[:k-1] (by removing the last character) could be the optimal solution for length k+1.

State expression: dp[i][j] is an array that stores all strings of length j that can be formed by doing operations on the first i characters of s, ordered lexicographically.
State expression: dp[j] is an array that stores all strings of length j that can be formed by doing operations on the last k characters of s, ordered lexicographically.

Create a 2D DP table to store the optimal solutions for substrings of s
The DP state transition equation would be:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j]) if j > 0 else dp[0][j]

Initialize dp[0][0] = s[:k]
Fill up the DP table row by row, updating dp[i][j] based on the transition equation
Finally, return dp[n][k]
