The key insight is that the optimal solution for a given length j can be computed from the optimal solutions for lengths j-1 and j-2. Specifically, if s[:k] is the optimal string of length k, then either s[:k+1] (by adding one more character) or s[:k-1] (by removing the last character) could be the optimal solution for length k+1.

State expression: dp[i][j] represents the lexicographically smallest string of length j that can be obtained by doing operations on the first i characters of s.
dp[i][j] = 1 if the last character of s[:i-1] is not equal to the j-th character, indicating that the optimal string of length j can be obtained by duplicating s[:i-1].
Otherwise, dp[i][j] is the minimum between the two options: either add the j-th character of s[:i] or remove the last character of the optimal string of length j-1.
This recursive definition allows us to compute the dynamic programming table values in a bottom-up manner.

Initialization: dp[0][j] = '' for all j, since there are no characters to operate on. Also, dp[i][0] = s[:i] for all i, since the empty string is always the optimal solution.
Memoization: Use a dictionary called memo to store the dynamic programming table values.

Main function:
1. Initialize the memo dictionary and set dp[0][j] = '' for all j.
2. For each character in s, update the dynamic programming table values using the recursive definition.
3. The lexicographically smallest string of length k is stored at dp[n][k].

This plan correctly captures the essence of the problem and provides a clear approach to solving it.
