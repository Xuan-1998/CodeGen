===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider all possible strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string. To avoid re-computing the same subproblems multiple times, use dynamic programming.

Define a set of states as all possible strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string. These states can be represented as (i, j), where i is the current length and j is the remaining characters in the original string.

Use a two-dimensional array dp to store the lexicographically smallest strings for each possible state. Initialize dp[0][j] = s[j], which means the lexicographically smallest string of length 1 that can be obtained by duplicating or deleting the last character.

For i > 0, consider all possible strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string. For each state (i, j), update dp[i][j] as follows:

* If j >= k, return s[:k], which is the lexicographically smallest string of length k.
* Otherwise, if deleting the last character results in a smaller string, set dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1].
* Otherwise, if duplicating the original string results in a smaller string, set dp[i][j] = s[:i+1].

Finally, return dp[n][k], which is the lexicographically smallest string of length k.
