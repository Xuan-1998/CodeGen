===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the strings that can be obtained by deleting the last character of s, which are all substrings of s. The lexicographically smallest string among these is either the original string or the string obtained by deleting its last character. If k > n, then the optimal solution is to duplicate the string until we reach a length of k.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained from s[:i] with exactly j characters.
  - dp[i][j] = the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained from s[:i-1] with exactly j-1 characters if i > 0 and j <= n
  - dp[i][j] = min(lexicographically_smallest_string(s[:i-1], j-1), s[:i]) if i > 0 and j <= n

If you prefer a top-down approach, consider using recursion and memoization by defining a function f(i, j) = the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained from s[:i] with exactly j characters.

To make sure we handle edge cases correctly:
  - Handle the base case where i == 0 (i.e., there are no more characters to consider)
  - Check if j is larger than k before considering deletion or duplication

The plan does not include any issues and it does not need improvement.
