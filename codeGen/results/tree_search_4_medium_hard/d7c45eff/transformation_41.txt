===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about how you can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. You can consider all possible strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string, and then try to find the lexicographically smallest one among them. This way, you can avoid re-computing the same subproblems multiple times.

dp[i][j] represents the lexicographically smallest string of length j that can be formed by either deleting the last character of the original string s[:i] or duplicating the original string s[:i-1].

dp[i][j] is equal to the minimum between deleting the last character of s[:i] (dp[i-1][j]) and duplicating s[:i-1] (dp[i-1][j-1]).

You can use a combination of both tabulation and memoization by using a 2D array dp to store the minimum lexicographically smallest string of length j that can be formed by either deleting the last character of the original string s[:i] or duplicating the original string s[:i-1], and also storing the intermediate results in a dictionary memo.

The final answer will be stored in dp[n][k].

To improve this plan, we should consider edge cases. For example, if k is greater than n, then there are no possible strings of length k that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string. In this case, we should return an empty string.

Also, to avoid unnecessary computation, we should sort the characters in the original string s before starting our dynamic programming approach.

Here's the updated plan:
