===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider all possible strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string, and then try to find the lexicographically smallest one among them.

Let dp[i][j] represent the lexicographically smallest string of length j that can be formed by either deleting the last character of the original string s[:i] or duplicating the original string s[:i-1].

dp[0][0] is an empty string, which is the lexicographically smallest.

For i > 0 and j > 0:
    If j > 1, consider two options: 
        1. Delete the last character of s[:i]. The resulting string will be dp[i-1][j-1].
        2. Duplicate s[:i-1], which results in dp[i-1][j].

Choose the lexicographically smallest one.

If j == 1, it means we need to decide whether to delete or not.
    If i > 0, then dp[i][1] is simply the last character of s[:i].
    If i == 0, then there are no characters left to consider. In this case, return an empty string.

Return dp[n][k].
