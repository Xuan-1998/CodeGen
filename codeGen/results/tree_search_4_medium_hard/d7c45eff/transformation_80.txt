===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider all possible strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string, and then try to find the lexicographically smallest one among them.

Define the state as a tuple containing the current string and its length. The transition relationships could be formulated by iterating over all possible operations (deleting the last character or duplicating the string) and checking if the resulting string is lexicographically smaller than the current one.

Start with an empty DP table, and then fill in the rest of the DP table row by row. For each cell in the DP table, consider all possible strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string, and then find the lexicographically smallest one among them.
