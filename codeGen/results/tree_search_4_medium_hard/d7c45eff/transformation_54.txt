===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem efficiently.

**State:** A tuple (s, d) representing the current string s and a boolean d indicating whether we should delete or duplicate the last character in the previous state.

**Transition:** We have two options:

* If d is False (i.e., we didn't delete/duplicate the last character), we can either:
	+ Delete the last character of s, resulting in a new string with length |s|-1 and a new boolean value True.
	+ Duplicate s, resulting in a new string with length 2|s| and a new boolean value False.
* If d is True (i.e., we deleted/duplicated the last character), we can only duplicate s, resulting in a new string with length 2|s| and a new boolean value False.

**Memoization:** We store the lexicographically smallest strings corresponding to each state in a 3D array dp[][][], where dp[i][j][0/1] represents the lexicographically smallest string of length i that can be obtained by either deleting or duplicating the last character, and dp[i][j][2] indicates whether we should delete or duplicate the last character.

**Base case:** If i == 0, there are only two possible strings: an empty string and a duplicated version of the original string. We store these in dp[0][k][0/1].

**Recursive formula:** For i > 0, we can use the transition rules above to compute dp[i][j][0/1] based on dp[i-1][j][0/1] and dp[i-1][j][2]. We choose the option that results in a lexicographically smaller string.

**Final answer:** The lexicographically smallest string of length k is stored in dp[n][k][0/1].
