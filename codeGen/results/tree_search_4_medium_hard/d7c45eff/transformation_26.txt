===BEGIN PLAN===
state dp[n+1][2], where n is the length of the original string s.

dp[i][0] represents the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string up to index i. dp[i][1] represents the same thing but with an additional operation (either delete or duplicate) at index i.

Choose a set of states to represent possible strings that have been formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string.
DP state: Consider all possible prefixes of the input string, and for each prefix, consider two options - delete the last character or duplicate the prefix. This will help you avoid re-computing the same subproblems multiple times.

Base case: dp[0][0] = "", dp[0][1] = ""

Transition function:
dp[i][0] = min(dp[i-1][0], s[i-1] + dp[i-1][1])
dp[i][1] = min(s[i-1] + dp[i-2][0], dp[i-1][1])

Final answer: the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string up to index k is dp[k][0].
