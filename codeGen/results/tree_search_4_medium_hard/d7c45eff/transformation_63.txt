Consider all possible strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string.
Think about a state as the current prefix of the desired string.
The transition relationships can be defined based on whether the last character of the current prefix is equal to the last character of the original string, and whether the length of the current prefix has reached k or not.

Create a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (k+1), where dp[i][j] represents the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by either deleting the last character of the original string or duplicating it, considering only the first i characters of the original string.
For each prefix length j from 0 to k:
    For each string prefix of length i up to n (n+1):
        If j is less than i, consider all strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the string, and fill in the dynamic programming table accordingly.

The base case would be when j equals 0; then dp[i][j] would represent the smallest lexicographically string of length 0 which is an empty string.
