===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] represents the lexicographically smallest string of length j that can be formed by either deleting the last character of the original string s[:i] or duplicating the original string s[:i-1].

The base case is when i == 0. In this case, dp[0][k] would represent the lexicographically smallest string of length k. Since we can only duplicate strings, we start by initializing dp[0][0] to the empty string, and for j > 0, dp[0][j] = s[:0]. This is because when i == 0, we cannot delete any characters.

Now, consider the recursive case. If i > 0, we have two options: either delete the last character of s[:i] or duplicate s[:i-1]. In this case, dp[i][j] would be the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by doing one of these operations.

If j < i, then it's always better to delete the last character of s[:i], because we don't have enough characters to duplicate. So, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j].

If j >= i, then we can either delete the last character or duplicate s[:i-1]. In this case, dp[i][j] is the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by doing one of these operations.

To avoid re-computing subproblems multiple times, we use dynamic programming to store the results in a 2D table. The time complexity is O(nk), where n is the length of the original string and k is the desired length.

Finally, return dp[n][k] as the lexicographically smallest string of length k that can be formed by either deleting the last character of the original string or duplicating the original string.
