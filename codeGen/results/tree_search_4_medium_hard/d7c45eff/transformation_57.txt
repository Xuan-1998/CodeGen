===BEGIN PLAN===
To use dynamic programming effectively, let's consider all possible strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string.

Let dp[i] denote the lexicographically smallest string of length i that can be obtained from the original string s. We can define a recursive formula as follows:

dp[0] = ""
dp[i] = min( // Consider all possible strings
  dp[i-1], // Delete the last character
  dp[i-1] + s[n-i+1], // Duplicate the string
) for i > 0

To avoid re-computing subproblems, we can use memoization. We define a function dp(i) that returns the lexicographically smallest string of length i.

dp(i):
  if i == 0:
    return ""
  if i < n: // If i is less than the original string length
    if s[n-i+1] <= s[n-i]: // Consider deleting the last character
      return dp(i-1)
    else: // Duplicate the string
      return dp(i-1) + s[n-i+1]
  else:
    // Since i >= n, we can only duplicate the original string
    return dp(n) * (i-n+1)

This approach ensures that each subproblem is computed at most once.
