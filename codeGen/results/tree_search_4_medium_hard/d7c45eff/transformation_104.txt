===BEGIN PLAN===
The key insight is that the optimal solution for a given length j can be computed from the optimal solutions for lengths j-1 and j-2. Specifically, if s[:k] is the optimal string of length k, then either s[:k+1] (by adding one more character) or s[:k-1] (by removing the last character) could be the optimal solution for length k+1.

State expression: dp[i][j] is an array that stores all strings of length j that can be formed by doing operations on the first i characters of s, ordered lexicographically.
State transition equation: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i][j-1]) if j > 0; otherwise, dp[i][j] is an array containing only one string (s[:k] for k=j).
Base case: dp[0][j] = [s[:j]].
Final answer: the lexicographically smallest string in dp[n][k].

Note: The state transition equation can be further simplified by considering the cases when j=k, and j=k+1 separately. This would reduce the number of comparisons required.

The plan is correct, but it's missing edge case handling. The recursive function should check if the desired length k is within the range of the problem constraints (1 to 5000) before proceeding with the computation.
