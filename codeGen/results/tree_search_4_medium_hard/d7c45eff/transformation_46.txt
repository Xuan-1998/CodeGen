DP state: For each string of length i, define two variables - dp[i][0] and dp[i][1]. 
dp[i][0] stores whether it's possible to form a lexicographically smaller string by deleting the last character of the original string up to length i.
dp[i][1] stores whether it's possible to form a lexicographically smaller string by duplicating the original string up to length i.

Base case: dp[0][0] = True, because an empty string is always lexicographically smaller than any other string.
For strings of non-zero length, initialize dp[0][1] = False and for all i > 0, dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][1].

Memoization can be applied using a 2D array where memo[i][j] stores whether it's possible to form a lexicographically smaller string of length j by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string up to length i.

Main idea: Iterate from k down to 0. For each i, check if dp[i][1] = True and if so, update dp[k-i][0] to be False (because we cannot form a lexicographically smaller string by deleting the last character).

Finally, return the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string. This can be done by iterating from 0 to k and returning the smallest string that corresponds to dp[i][0] = True.
