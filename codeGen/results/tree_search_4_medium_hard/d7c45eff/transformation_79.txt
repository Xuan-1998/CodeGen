===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming can be used to solve this problem by considering all possible strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string. Then, find the lexicographically smallest one among them.

Define the state as a tuple containing the current string and its length. The transition relationships could be formulated by iterating over all possible operations (deleting the last character or duplicating the string) and checking if the resulting string is lexicographically smaller than the current one.

Start with the base cases: dp[0][k] = "", dp[n][0] = "". This ensures that the dynamic programming table is initialized correctly for the smallest lengths.

For each length i from 1 to n, iterate over all strings of length i. For each string, consider two operations:

- Deleting the last character: If the resulting string has a length less than k, update dp[i-1][k] = dp[i-1][k].
- Duplicating the string: Update dp[i][k-i] = dp[i][k-i].

For each of these operations, check if the resulting string is lexicographically smaller than the current smallest string. If it is, update dp[k][k] with the new string.

Finally, return dp[k][k], which contains the lexicographically smallest string of length k that can be obtained by doing the operations on the original string.
