dp[i][j] represents the lexicographically smallest string of length j that can be obtained by doing operations on the first i characters of s.

Let's define dp[i][j] as follows:

- If j == 0, then dp[i][j] = "" (empty string)
- If j > 0 and i == 1, then dp[i][j] = s[:j] (the original string up to the j-th character)
- Otherwise, let last_char = s[i-1]
- If the j-th character of the lexicographically smallest string is not equal to last_char, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] (duplicate the optimal string for length j-1)
- Else, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] (remove the last character and consider the optimal string for length j-2)

The base case is when i == 0 or j == 0.
