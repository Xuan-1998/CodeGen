===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider all possible strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string, and then try to find the lexicographically smallest one among them.

dp[i][j] represents the lexicographically smallest string of length j that can be formed by either deleting the last character of the original string s[:i] or duplicating the original string s[:i-1].

Consider dp[i][j] as the minimum of two options: 
    - delete the last character of s[:i] and get dp[i-1][j-1]
    - duplicate s[:i-1] to get dp[i-1][j]

Implement memoization with recursion, using dp[i][j] to store the result of subproblems.

Initialize dp[0][0] as the original string, since there's no operation needed for a string of length 0. For all i > 0 and j >= 0, if s[:i] has more characters than s[:i-1], then consider duplicating s[:i-1] to get dp[i-1][j]. If s[:i] is lexicographically smaller than the result from dp[i-1][j-1], then consider deleting the last character of s[:i] and get dp[i-1][j-1].

For edge cases, handle strings with lengths less than or equal to 0 separately.
