===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about how you can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. You can consider all possible strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string, and then try to find the lexicographically smallest one among them. This way, you can avoid re-computing the same subproblems multiple times.

: Define a state (s, duplication) as a tuple where s is the current string and duplication is a boolean indicating whether the string was duplicated.

Use a dictionary dp as a memo to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computation. Initialize dp with an empty dictionary.

Iterate over all possible strings of length up to k. For each string, check if it can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string (this is where you'll need to implement some logic).

For each string s, calculate its lexicographically smallest form by comparing it with its duplicate and the one obtained by deleting the last character.

Store the result in dp[(s, duplication)] if the string has not been processed before. Otherwise, return the previously computed result from dp.

Find the lexicographically smallest string of length k in dp and return it as the result.
