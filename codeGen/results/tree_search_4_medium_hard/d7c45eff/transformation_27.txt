===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about how you can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. You can consider all possible strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string, and then try to find the lexicographically smallest one among them. This way, you can avoid re-computing the same subproblems multiple times.

state
Choose a set of states to represent possible strings that have been formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string.
DP state: Represent possible strings as a tuple (prefix_length, operation), where prefix_length is the length of the remaining part of the original string after some operations, and operation is either 'delete' or 'duplicate'. This way, you can represent all possible strings that have been formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string.
Fill up a DP table with base cases: 
DP[0, 'start'] = (original_string[0], 'start')  # start state
DP[i+1, 'delete'] = DP[i, 'delete'] for i in range(n-1)  # delete last character
DP[i, 'duplicate'] = (original_string[:i] + original_string[i:], 'duplicate') for i in range(k)  # duplicate the string

main loop:
For each prefix_length from 0 to k:
    For each operation in ['delete', 'duplicate']:
        If operation == 'delete' and prefix_length < n:
            DP[prefix_length, 'delete'] = min(DP[i, 'delete'] for i in range(prefix_length+1)) + (original_string[prefix_length], 'delete')
        elif operation == 'duplicate':
            if prefix_length > 0:
                DP[prefix_length, 'duplicate'] = min((DP[i, 'duplicate'][0] + original_string[0] for i in range(min(prefix_length, k))), default='start')  # duplicate the string
            else:
                DP[prefix_length, 'duplicate'] = (original_string[:k], 'duplicate')

Final answer: 
Return the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string. This is represented as a tuple (DP[k-1, operation][0], 'end')
