dp[i][j] = {
    1 if i == 0 and j <= k: duplicate s[:i] until we reach a length of k,
    dp[i-1][j] if i < n and j <= len(s): the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained from s[:i] with exactly j characters is either the original string or the string obtained by deleting its last character,
    s[:i] if j == i and j == min(i, k): return the lexicographically smallest substring of s[:i] with exactly j characters
}
dp[0][j] = {
    if j <= n: duplicate s until we reach a length of j,
    ''
}

Let's consider some examples:

* If k > n, then the optimal solution is to duplicate the string until we reach a length of k.
* If k == n, then the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by either deleting the last character or duplicating the string is s itself.

We need to make sure that our state expression captures all these cases correctly. The base case dp[0][j] handles the case where we start with an empty string and duplicate it until we reach a length of j.
The recurrence relation dp[i][j] takes into account whether we should delete the last character or duplicate the string.
