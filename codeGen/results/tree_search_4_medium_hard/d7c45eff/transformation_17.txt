===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the strings that can be obtained by deleting the last character of s, which are all substrings of s. The lexicographically smallest string among these is either the original string or the string obtained by deleting its last character. If k > n, then the optimal solution is to duplicate the string until we reach a length of k.

dp[i][j] = 
  if i < j: dp[i-1][j-1]
  elif i == j: s[:i]
  else: dp[i][k-j]

Use a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the lexicographically smallest string of length j that can be obtained by deleting at most i characters from the original string.
