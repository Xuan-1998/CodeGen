===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem by considering all possible strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string, and then try to find the lexicographically smallest one among them.

The state represents a string of length up to k, with each state being a pair (s, deleted), where s is the current string and deleted is a boolean indicating whether the last character was deleted.

Create a 2D array dp of size n x (k+1) to store the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string up to length k. Initialize the base case where s is empty, i.e., dp[0][i] = "" for all 0 <= i <= k.

The recursive formula will be: if the current string has length less than k, then we consider two options - either delete the last character or duplicate the original string. If we decide to delete the last character, we get a new string s' by removing the last character from s. Then, we try to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the string s'. We store this result in dp[i-1][j-1]. If we decide to duplicate the original string, then the new string is just the duplication of s. In this case, we also try to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the string s', and store it in dp[i-1][j].

Finally, we return the lexicographically smallest string among these two options.
