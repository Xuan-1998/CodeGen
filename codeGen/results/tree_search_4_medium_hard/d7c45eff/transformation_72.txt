===BEGIN PLAN===
Let's break down the plan step by step:

: Initialize a 2D table dp with dimensions (n+1) x (k+1), where n is the length of the original string, and k is the desired length. Each cell dp[i][j] will store the lexicographically smallest string of length j that can be formed using the first i characters of the original string.
: Set all cells in the first row to the empty string "" (since we're starting from an empty string). For each subsequent row, iterate over columns 0 to k:
    : If j is 0, dp[i][j] is always an empty string. If j > 0, consider two options:
        - Delete the last character of the current string s: dp[i-1][j-1]
        - Duplicate the current string s: dp[i][j-1]
    : Choose the lexicographically smallest option and store it in dp[i][j].
: The final answer is stored in dp[n][k], which represents the lexicographically smallest string of length k that can be formed using all characters of the original string.
