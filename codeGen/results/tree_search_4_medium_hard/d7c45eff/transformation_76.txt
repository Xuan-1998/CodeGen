To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming and consider all possible strings that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string.

:  Each state represents a tuple (prefix_length, operation), where prefix_length is the length of the current prefix of the desired string and operation is either 'delete' or 'duplicate', indicating the last action taken to form the prefix.

To avoid re-computing the same subproblems multiple times, we can store previously computed states in a dictionary and look them up as needed.

Here's a more detailed plan:

1. Initialize a dictionary dp to store previously computed states.

2. Define a function f(prefix_length) that returns the lexicographically smallest string of length prefix_length that can be obtained by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string.

3. Base case: If prefix_length is 0, return an empty string.

4. Recursive case:
   - If the current operation is 'delete', and there are at least two characters left in the string, recursively call f(prefix_length-1) to get the lexicographically smallest string of length prefix_length-1.
     - Otherwise, return the last character of the original string.
   - If the current operation is 'duplicate', recursively call f(prefix_length-2) to get the lexicographically smallest string of length prefix_length-2 and duplicate it.

5. Initialize a variable result with an empty string.

6. Iterate from 1 to k (inclusive):
    - Calculate the minimum lexicographically smallest string of length i that can be obtained by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string using f(i).
    - If this minimum string is smaller than the current result, update the result.

7. Return the final result.
