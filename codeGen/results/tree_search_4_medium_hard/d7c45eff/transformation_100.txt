State expression: dp[j] is a boolean array where dp[j] = True if the lexicographically smallest string of length j can be obtained by duplicating s[:i], and False otherwise.

dp[j] = any s[:i] such that len(s[:i]) == j-1, and s[j-1] <= s[-1], dp[j-1]

dp = {}  # dictionary to store the lexicographically smallest string of length j
for i in range(k+1):
    if i == 0:
        dp[i] = ''
    elif i == 1:
        dp[i] = s[0]
    else:
        for j in range(i-2, -1, -1):  # iterate from i-2 to 0
            if (dp[j] and s[j] <= s[-1]):
                dp[i] = dp[j] + s[-1]  # duplicate the last character of dp[j]
                break

print(dp[k])
