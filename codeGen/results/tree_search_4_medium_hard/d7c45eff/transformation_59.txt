===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can define two arrays dp and dp1, where dp[i] represents the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string of length i. Similarly, dp1[i] represents the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the duplicated string of length i.

We start by initializing dp[0] and dp1[0]. Since there are no characters in an empty string, we set both dp[0] and dp1[0] to an empty string, which is considered the lexicographically smallest.

Then, for each i from 1 to k:
    - If the last character of the original string of length i-1 is less than or equal to 'z', then the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string of length i-1 is the same as the one for i-1. So, dp[i] = dp[i-1]. 
    - If the last character of the original string of length i-1 is greater than 'z', then we need to duplicate the original string of length i-1, so dp[i] = 'z' + dp[i-1].
    
For dp1:
    - For each i from 0 to k, if i is 0 or dp[i] is an empty string, then dp1[i] = dp[i]. 
    - If i is greater than 0 and dp[i] is not an empty string, then we need to duplicate the original string of length i. So, dp1[i] = 'z' + dp[i].
    
Finally, return dp1[k] as the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by either deleting the last character or duplicating the original string of length k.
