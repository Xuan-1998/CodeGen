===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the strings that can be obtained by deleting the last character of s, which are all substrings of s. The lexicographically smallest string among these is either the original string or the string obtained by deleting its last character. If k > n, then the optimal solution is to duplicate the string until we reach a length of k.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained from s[:i] with exactly j characters.
dp[i][j] = 
    - the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained from s[:i-1] with exactly j-1 characters if i > 0 and j <= n, or
    - the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained from s[:i] with exactly j characters.

Implement a recursive function with memoization to avoid redundant computations. The base cases could be dp[i][j] = s[:i] if i == 0 or j == 0.
The recursive case is when i > 0 and j > n, then we can duplicate the string until we reach a length of k.

Memoize the results to avoid redundant computations. This will reduce the time complexity from exponential to polynomial.
