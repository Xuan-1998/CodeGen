The key insight is that the optimal solution relies on rearranging plants within each species group rather than swapping entire sections. This could be approached through a dynamic programming bottom-up approach.

To define the state as (x_i, s) where x_i is the position of the ith plant and s is its species. The goal is to minimize the number of plants that need to be replanted to achieve the desired arrangement.

Define the state dp[s][k] representing the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted for all plants with species 1 through k, where s is the current section (1-indexed).

Transition relationships involve adding or removing a plant from this state. For each new plant (x_i, s), update the state dp[s][k] as follows:
- If the new plant's position x_i belongs to an existing section, just count the number of plants that need to be replanted for this section and increment it by 1.
- If the new plant's position x_i does not belong to any existing section, create a new section with this plant and count the number of plants that need to be replanted in this section.

Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach:

dp[0][k] = k (base case: one section per species)
for s from 1 to m:
    for k from 2 to n:
        if x_k belongs to existing sections:
            dp[s][k] = dp[s-1][k-1] + 1
        else:
            create a new section with this plant and count the number of plants that need to be replanted in this section

The final answer is dp[m][n].
