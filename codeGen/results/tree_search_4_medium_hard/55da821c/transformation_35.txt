===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the problem as a sequence of decisions where each decision depends on the previous ones and use memoization to store and reuse previously computed results.

The current temperature profile (m+1 integers) represents the number of plants at each temperature level, with all plants initially having their own unique temperature. 

Treat each plant's position and species as independent components of the state and formulate a transition relationship based on the decision of placing or not placing a border. This can be done by considering two possible actions: (1) place a border at the current position to separate the newly added plants from those already present, and (2) do not place a border.

Implement memoization using a dictionary where the keys are tuples representing the current state and the values are the corresponding minimal costs. The state tuple should include the number of plants in each section, their positions, and species. 

For each state, calculate the minimum cost by considering all possible actions (place a border or do not place a border) and recursively explore the resulting states. The final result is the minimum cost required to achieve the desired arrangement.

The base case for the recursion would be when there are no more plants left to arrange (i.e., n == 0), in which case the minimum cost is 0, as no replanting is needed.
