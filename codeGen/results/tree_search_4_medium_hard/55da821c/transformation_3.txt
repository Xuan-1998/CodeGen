===BEGIN PLAN===
The state could be the current section and the last species seen, and the transition would be: if the current plant's species is equal to the current section, do nothing; otherwise, increment the section and update the last species seen. This way we can keep track of which section each species belongs in.

State: (current_section, last_species), Transition: (if current_species == current_section, (current_section, current_species); else (current_section + 1, current_species))
Use a 2D table with dimensions (m, n+1), where m represents the number of sections and n is the maximum number of plants replanted. Initialize the table with zeros.
Initialize the first row to represent the base case: all plants are in their correct section.

Transition:
    - If current_species == current_section, fill in the current cell with the value from the previous cell
    - Else, fill in the current cell with the minimum of 1 (replanting this plant) and the value from the top-left cell plus 1 (not replanting this plant)
Final answer would be the last cell of the bottom row. This way we can efficiently keep track of the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted.
