===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach where we use a 2D array dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted for i plants and j species.

1. Initialize dp[0][i] = 0 for all i (base case: no plants need to be replanted when there are no plants).
2. For each plant i, calculate the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted by considering the following options:
    * Replanting all plants of species j up to the current temperature profile.
    * Merging the current plant with the previous plants of the same species.
3. Update dp[i][j] with the minimum value obtained from the above options.
4. For each species j, find the optimal arrangement by minimizing dp[n-1][j] over all possible positions for the last plant.
5. Return the total number of plants that need to be replanted as the sum of dp[n-1][j] over all species.
