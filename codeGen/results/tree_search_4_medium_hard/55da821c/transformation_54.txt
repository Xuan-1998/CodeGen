===BEGIN PLAN===
To create a 2D array with dimensions m x n, where each cell (i, j) stores the minimum number of replantings needed for the first i plants and up to j species.

1. Initialize the dynamic programming array dp with dimensions m x n, all initialized to -1.
2. Iterate through the plants from left to right:
    a. For each plant, get its species s_i.
    b. Update the state (species_count_map, section_index) accordingly:
        i. If the current section index is less than s_i, increment the current section index and reset the species_count_map for this new section.
        ii. Increment the count of s_i in the species_count_map.
    c. For each possible previous plant p with a position x_p < x_i:
        i. Calculate the difference between the positions x_i - x_p.
        ii. If the difference is greater than or equal to 1, it means the current plant belongs to a new section, so increment the current section index and reset the species_count_map for this new section.
    d. Update the dynamic programming array dp at position (s_i, i) with the minimum number of replantings needed so far.
