===BEGIN PLAN===
The key insight is that the optimal solution relies on rearranging plants within each species group rather than swapping entire sections. This could be approached through a dynamic programming bottom-up approach.

To define the state as (i, last_s) where i is the current position and last_s is the species of the last plant that was relocated.

The state can be represented as (i, last_s, dp) where i is the current position, last_s is the species of the last plant that was relocated, and dp[i][last_s] is a dynamic programming table storing the minimum number of replantings needed to achieve the desired arrangement up to this point.

Develop a hybrid approach that combines tabulation and memoization. Initialize the dp array with infinity for each state (i, last_s).

Iterate through the plants from left to right. For each plant at position i with species s, update dp[i][s] as the minimum of:

- The current value in dp[i][s]
- dp[i-1][s'] + 1, where s' is the previous species

This represents the number of replantings needed to move all plants of species s to their correct section.

Finally, return dp[n-1][last_s] as the minimum number of replantings needed for the entire arrangement.
