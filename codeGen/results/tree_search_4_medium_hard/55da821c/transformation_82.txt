===BEGIN PLAN===
The key insight is that the optimal solution relies on rearranging plants within each species group rather than swapping entire sections. This could be approached through a dynamic programming bottom-up approach.

To define the state as (x_i, s) where x_i is the position of the ith plant and s is its species.

Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted up to the ith plant. The transition relationship involves moving a plant from one section to another, considering the temperature requirements.

The state can be updated as follows:

- If the current plant has the same species as the previous plant, there is no need for replanting.
- Otherwise, consider two options: move the current plant to the next available section or keep it in its original section. The minimum number of replants is the minimum of these two options.

The plan can be refined as follows:

* Initialize dp[0] = 0 since there are no plants that need to be replanted initially.
* For each i from 1 to n-1:
	+ If s_i != s_{i-1}, consider moving the current plant to the next available section or keeping it in its original section. The minimum number of replants is the minimum of these two options.
	+ Update dp[i] with the minimum value.
* The final answer is dp[n-1].

This plan accounts for all edge cases, including plants at the beginning and end of the line.
