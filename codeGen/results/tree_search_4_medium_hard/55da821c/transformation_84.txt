The key insight is that the optimal solution relies on rearranging plants within each species group rather than swapping entire sections.

To define the state as (x_i, s) where x_i is the position of the ith plant and s is its species. This allows us to track the positions of plants of each species separately.

Define the state (x_1, ..., x_k) representing the positions of plants of each species 1 through k. This represents a section of the greenhouse where all plants have been rearranged to their desired species.

Transition relationships involve adding or removing a plant from this state. For example, adding a plant of species j to a section with plants of species i would require moving all plants of species i to the right of the added plant. Removing a plant of species j would involve finding the closest plant of that species to move it to its new position.

Memoize the solutions to subproblems by storing intermediate results in a 2D array indexed by (species, plants_in_section). This allows us to avoid recomputing the solution for subproblems multiple times.

Use these memoized values to compute the solution for larger subproblems. For example, when adding a plant of species j to a section with plants of species i, we can use the previously computed solution for the section without this added plant and adjust it accordingly.

This approach would allow us to efficiently compute the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted to achieve the desired arrangement.
