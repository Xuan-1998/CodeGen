===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other, then solve them in order from left to right, considering each plant's position and species.

The state can be defined as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of plants replanted to achieve the desired arrangement for the first i plants and j-th species.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + 1 if s_i == k, dp[i-1][j]) for all k from 1 to m

Memoize the solution by storing the minimum number of replanted plants for each species at each plant position

The plan correctly identifies the state and recursive formula.

To improve the plan, consider initializing the dp array with values based on the initial conditions (e.g., dp[0][j] = 0 for all j).

Potential issues:

* The plan does not account for edge cases where i or j is equal to 0. A base case should be defined for these scenarios.
* The plan assumes that the input plants are correctly ordered from left to right, but it doesn't explicitly check this.
