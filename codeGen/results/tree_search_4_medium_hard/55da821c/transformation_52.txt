===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other, then solve them in order from left to right, considering each plant's position and species.

The state can be defined as a dictionary {species: count} where count is the number of plants replanted for that species so far.
Formulate state as dp, where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of replanting for the first i plants to put them in j sections.
memo = {i: {} for i in range(m)}; memo[i][j] is updated based on the minimum number of replanting for the first i plants to put them in j species, considering each plant's position and species.

For each plant at index i:
    1. Find the smallest section where this plant can be placed without disturbing previously placed plants.
    2. Update dp[i][j] by calculating the minimum number of replanting for the first i plants to put them in j sections considering this new placement.
