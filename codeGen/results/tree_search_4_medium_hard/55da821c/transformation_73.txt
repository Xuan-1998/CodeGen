===BEGIN PLAN===
The key insight is that the optimal solution relies on rearranging plants within each species group rather than swapping entire sections. This could be approached through a dynamic programming bottom-up approach.

To define the state as (i, last_s) where i is the current position and last_s is the species of the last plant that was relocated.,

Consider using a combination of dynamic programming states: 
(s, x) representing the optimal sectioning point for species s at position x, 
and dp[i][s] representing the minimum number of replantings needed up to the i-th plant with the last species being s.

memo = {}

def min_replantings(n, m, plants):
    dp = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n + 1)]
    memo = {}
    
    def dfs(i, s):
        if (i, s) in memo:
            return memo[(i, s)]
        
        last_s = -1
        for j in range(m):
            if plants[i][0] == j and last_s != s:
                last_s = s
                break
        
        dp[i][s] = 0 if i < n else float('inf')
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            for k in range(1, m + 1):
                if plants[j - 1][0] == k and last_s != k:
                    last_s = k
                    break
            
            dp[i][s] = min(dp[i][s], dfs(j, k) + (j - i))
        
        memo[(i, s)] = dp[i][s]
        return dp[i][s]

    return dfs(0, 1)
