===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other, then solve them in order from left to right, considering each plant's position and species.

The state can be defined as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of plants replanted to achieve the desired arrangement for the first i plants and j-th species.
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + 1 if s_i == k, dp[i-1][j]) for all k from 1 to m

Use memoization with a dictionary where the key is a tuple of (i, j) and the value is the minimum number of plants replanted to achieve the desired arrangement for the first i plants and j-th species.

To improve the plan, consider using a more efficient data structure than a dictionary for memoization, such as a list or array, since the problem constraints allow for at most 5,000 different (i, j) values.
The plan correctly identifies the key states in the dynamic programming solution but can be further refined by explicitly handling edge cases, such as the base case when i is 0.
The plan also assumes that all plants are given in order "from left to right", which is guaranteed by the problem constraints.
