===BEGIN PLAN===
The key insight is that the optimal solution relies on rearranging plants within each species group rather than swapping entire sections. This could be approached through a dynamic programming bottom-up approach.

To define the state as (i, last_s) where i is the current position and last_s is the species of the last plant that was relocated.
Define state as (i, s) where i is the current position and s is the species of the last plant at this position.

Create a 3D table dp[i][s][species] to store the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted up to i-th plant with species s. Initialize all values in dp as infinity.

For each plant, update dp[i][s][species] by considering two options:
1. The current plant is part of the same section as the previous one.
2. The current plant starts a new section.

The minimum number of replants will be the minimum between these two options.

Initialize the result variable to infinity.
For each species, iterate from left to right and update dp[i][s][species] accordingly.

Finally, return the minimum value in the table.
