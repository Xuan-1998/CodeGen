===BEGIN PLAN===
The key insight is that the optimal solution relies on rearranging plants within each species group rather than swapping entire sections. This could be approached through a dynamic programming bottom-up approach.

To define the state as (i, last_s) where i is the current position and last_s is the species of the last plant that was relocated.,

The state can be represented as (i, last_s, dp) where i is the current position, last_s is the species of the last plant that was relocated, and dp is a dynamic programming table storing the minimum number of replantings needed to achieve the desired arrangement up to this point.

Use bottom-up tabulation with a 3D array to store the state: dp[i][last_s][species] where i is the current position, last_s is the species of the last plant that was relocated, and species is the current species being considered.
Initialize the base cases for the dynamic programming table by considering only one plant per species (i.e., i = 0) and calculate the minimum number of replantings needed.

Fill in the dynamic programming table by iterating over each position i from left to right. For each position, consider each possible last_s and calculate the minimum number of replantings needed by minimizing the sum of the current plant's distance to its desired section and the minimum number of replantings needed for all previous plants with the same species.

Finally, return dp[n-1][last_s][species] as the minimum number of replantings needed to achieve the desired arrangement.
