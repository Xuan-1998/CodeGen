===BEGIN PLAN===
The overlapping subproblems arise from the fact that, given a certain set of plants already replanted, we need to decide which plant to move next.

The state could be (last_replanted_species, last_replanted_position), where last_replanted_species is the species of the last plant replanted and last_replanted_position is its corresponding position. This allows us to keep track of the last plant replanted and its position in the greenhouse.

Choose the state as (last_replanted_species, last_replanted_position), where last_replanted_species is the species of the last plant replanted and last_replanted_position is its corresponding position. The transition relationship could be to either replant a new plant or not, based on whether the current plant's species matches the last replanted species or not.

You can implement tabulation by creating a 3D table where the rows represent the possible last_replanted_species, the columns represent the total_plants_replanted, and the depth represents the position of the current plant. Then, fill up the table based on whether the current plant's species matches the last replanted species or not.

The base case would be when the total number of plants replanted is 0, in which case we don't need to replant any plants.

To improve this plan, we could also consider using memoization instead of tabulation if the problem has a lot of repeated subproblems. This could help reduce the time complexity by avoiding redundant calculations.

Potential issues with the plan include handling edge cases such as when there are no more plants left to be replanted or when all species have been placed in their corresponding sections.

This plan includes edge cases such as checking if there are any plants left to be replanted and if all species have been placed.
