The key insight is that the optimal solution relies on rearranging plants within each species group rather than swapping entire sections. This could be approached through a dynamic programming bottom-up approach.

To define the state as (x_i, s) where x_i is the position of the ith plant and s is its species.

Define the state (x_1, ..., x_k) representing the positions of plants of each species 1 through k.

Transition relationships involve adding or removing a plant from this state.

Dynamically build up a table dp[i][s] where i represents the number of plants seen so far and s is the current species. Each cell represents the minimum number of replanting required given a set of species up to the current one, considering all possible placements of the next plant.

Let dp[i-1][j] be the minimum number of replantings for the first i-1 plants with species j.

For each new plant (x_i, s) where 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ s ≤ m:

    If it's the first plant of its species or it can't be moved to a different section without replanting:
        dp[i][s] = dp[i-1][s]
    Else:
        Let k be the maximum index such that x_k < x_i. Calculate the minimum number of replantings for the plants up to and including the ith plant.

        For each possible placement of the (i+1)th plant, calculate the number of species that would need to be replanted.

        dp[i][s] is the minimum number of replantings among all these possible placements.

The final answer is the sum of dp[i][s] for i = 1 to n and s = 1 to m.
