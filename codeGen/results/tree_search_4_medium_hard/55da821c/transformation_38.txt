===BEGIN PLAN===
Considering the problem as a sequence of decisions, where each decision depends on the previous ones, we can use memoization to store and reuse previously computed results.

A pair consisting of the current section number and the number of remaining plants to place (from 0 to n) in that section.
To create a DP table with dimensions m x (n+1), where each cell [i][j] represents the minimum number of replanting needed to place j plants in i sections.

For each cell, we can consider all possible ways to place the remaining plants in the current section and calculate the minimum number of replantings needed.
Avoid recomputation by pre-computing all possible replanting counts for each section and then selecting the minimum one.

To fill up the DP table, start from the base case where there is only 1 plant left (j = 1), place it in its corresponding species section and update the count accordingly.
Then, iterate over the sections from right to left, considering all possible placements of the remaining plants for each section. 
For each cell [i][j], check if placing j plants in i-th section is feasible by checking if there are enough plants left (j <= n - i * m). 
If it's feasible, calculate the minimum number of replantings needed and update the DP table accordingly.
Finally, return the value at the top-right corner of the DP table [m][n] which represents the minimum number of replanting needed to place all plants in the desired arrangement.
