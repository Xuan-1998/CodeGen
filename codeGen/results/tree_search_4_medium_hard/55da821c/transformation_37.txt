===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the problem as a sequence of decisions, where each decision depends on the previous ones, we can use memoization to store and reuse previously computed results.

A pair consisting of the current section number and the number of remaining plants to place (from 0 to n) in that section.

To create a DP table with dimensions m x (n+1), where each cell [i][j] represents the minimum number of replanting needed to place j plants in i sections.

Use memoization with a hash map/dictionary where keys are the section numbers and values are lists of previously computed replanting counts, storing for each pair (i, j) the minimum number of replanting needed to place j plants in i sections.

In the main loop, iterate over all possible pairs (i, j), compute the optimal solution using the stored values from previous iterations and update the DP table accordingly.

To determine the minimum number of replanting needed to place j plants in i sections, consider the following options:
  * Place all remaining plants (j) in the current section (i)
  * Divide the plants into two groups: one for the current section (i) and another for the next section (i+1), considering the minimum number of replanting needed to place j-1 plants in i sections.

The final result is the value at the bottom-right cell [m][n] in the DP table, which represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted to achieve the desired arrangement.
