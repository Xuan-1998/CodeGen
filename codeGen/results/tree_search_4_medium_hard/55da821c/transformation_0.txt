===BEGIN PLAN===
The overlapping subproblems arise from the fact that, given a certain set of plants already replanted, we need to decide which plant to move next. This is a classic example of a dynamic programming problem.

State: (number of replanted plants, section)
Transition: 
    - If the current plant's species matches the previous one, do nothing.
    - If not, replant the plant in the next section and increment the number of replanted plants.

Create a dynamic programming table with dimensions (m * n) where m is the number of species and n is the total number of plants. The entry at row i and column j will represent the minimum number of replanted plants required to achieve the desired arrangement after processing the first j plants, given that all previous plants have been replanted into their respective sections.

The base case would be when j = 0, where we require no replanting.
The recurrence relation would be:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + 1 (if plant at index k is of different species than the previous one)) for all k from 0 to j-1

Fill up the table in a bottom-up manner.

Finally, return dp[m-1][n-1] as it represents the minimum number of replanted plants required to achieve the desired arrangement after processing all n plants.
