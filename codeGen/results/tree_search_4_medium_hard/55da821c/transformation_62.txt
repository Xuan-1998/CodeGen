===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other. For each plant at position i and species j, consider all possible positions k for plants of species k from 1 to m.

The state can be defined as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of plants replanted to achieve the desired arrangement for the first i plants and j-th species.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[k-1][k] + (i-k) if s_i == k, dp[i][j]) for all k from 1 to m

Implement dynamic programming using bottom-up approach where you fill up the dp table row by row from left to right. Start with base cases dp[0][j] = 0 and dp[i][k] = dp[i-1][k] if s_i != k for all i, j, and k.

This plan can be improved by considering the fact that once a plant is replanted, it cannot be moved again. So, we need to update our state only when the current plant's species matches with the desired section.

The potential issues with this plan are:
- It does not handle the case where there are multiple species present in the same section.
- The base cases do not consider the fact that some plants may already be replanted and cannot be moved again.

To include edge cases, we can add checks for these edge cases at each step. For example, if a plant is already in its desired section, it does not need to be replanted.
