===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use memoization to solve this problem by creating a 2D table dp where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted up to the i-th temperature level and j-th position in the desired arrangement.

Initially, all plants have their own unique temperature. We start from the leftmost plant and work our way rightwards.
For each plant, we consider two options: either we move it to its correct species section or we keep it at its current position.

We calculate the minimum number of replantings for the current plant by considering these two options and recursively applying this process to the remaining plants. We store the result in the dp table and use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

At the end, we return the value stored in the top-right cell of the dp table, which represents the minimum number of replantings needed for all plants.
