===BEGIN PLAN===
Using dynamic programming, we can solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and storing the results in a 2D table.

1. Initialize a 2D DP table dp with dimensions (n+1) x (m+1), where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted for the first i plants, considering j sections.
2. Fill the base case: dp[0][j] = 0, since we don't need to replant any plants when there are no plants.
3. Iterate over each plant:
   - For each plant at position x_i and species s_i, consider placing it in each of the m sections (1-based indexing).
   - For each section j:
     - If the current plant is of species j, then we can place it in this section without replanting any plants. So, dp[i][j] = 0.
     - Otherwise, we need to replant the plants that are currently in this section to make room for the new plant. This can be calculated as dp[x_i-1][j] + 1 (since one extra border is needed).
4. Finally, return dp[n][m], which represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted.
