State expression: The number of plants that need to be replanted (1 integer) and the current section being considered (m integers).
The state is a tuple of (replanted count, section), where replanted count is an integer representing the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted to achieve the desired arrangement up to the given section, and section is a list of size m containing 1's and 0's indicating whether each species resides in its corresponding section or not.

Explore using a 2D array dp with dimensions (n + 1) x m, where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted up to i-th plant considering only the first j sections. 

Transition: For each plant, explore all possible placements for it in the considered sections. 
For each placement, update dp[i][j] based on the previous states and the current state.

Base case: The minimum number of plants that need to be replanted for an empty section is 0.
