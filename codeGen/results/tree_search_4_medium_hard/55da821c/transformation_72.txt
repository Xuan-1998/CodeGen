===BEGIN PLAN===
The key insight is that the optimal solution relies on rearranging plants within each species group rather than swapping entire sections. This could be approached through a dynamic programming bottom-up approach.

To define the state as (i, last_s) where i is the current position and last_s is the species of the last plant that was relocated.

Consider using a combination of dynamic programming states: 
dp[(i, s)] representing the minimum number of replantings needed up to the i-th plant with the last species being s,
and
sectioning_points[s] representing the optimal sectioning point for species s.
Memoization

Initialization:
- dp[(0, 1)] = 0 (no plants need replanting initially)
- sectioning_points[1] = 0 (no replanting needed)

Transition function:
- For each plant i and its corresponding species s, 
   - If the current species is different from the last_s, 
     - Calculate dp[(i, s)] as the minimum of 
       - dp[(i-1, s')] + 1 (replant all plants with species s' and then add this one)
       - i - sectioning_points[last_s] (place it in its own section if we're not replanting within the last section)
     - Update sectioning_points[s] to be the maximum of 
       - sectioning_points[last_s]
       - i
   - If the current species is the same as last_s, 
     - dp[(i, s)] = dp[(i-1, s)]
- The answer would then be dp[(n, m)]
