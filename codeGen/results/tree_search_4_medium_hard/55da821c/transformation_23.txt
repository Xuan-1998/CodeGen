===BEGIN PLAN===
The overlapping subproblems arise from the fact that, given a certain set of plants already replanted, we need to decide which plant to move next. This is a classic example of a dynamic programming problem.

The state could be (total_species_replanted, current_section), where total_species_replanted is the number of species that have been replanted and current_section is the section where we are currently placing a new plant. The transition relationship could be to either move to the next section or stay in the same section based on whether the current plant's species matches the one being placed.

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, starting from the end of the line and working backwards, by iterating through all possible states and transitions. To avoid counting the same subproblem multiple times, use memoization to store the results of previously computed states.

For each state (total_species_replanted, current_section), consider two options: either move to the next section or stay in the same section. Calculate the minimum number of replanting required for each option and choose the one that leads to the minimum total replanting.

Finally, return the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted to achieve the desired arrangement, which corresponds to the state (0, 1), indicating no species have been replanted yet.
