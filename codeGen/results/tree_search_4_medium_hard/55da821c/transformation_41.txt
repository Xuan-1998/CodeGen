===BEGIN PLAN===
Using dynamic programming with memoization, we can solve this problem by keeping track of the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted for each possible section number and remaining plant count.

States: (section, remaining_plants)
Transitions:
1. If there's only one plant left, place it in the current section.
2. If there are more than one plants left, try placing the next plant in the current section or a new one.
3. For each option, calculate the minimum number of replanted plants by adding the cost of this move to the minimum for the previous state.

Memoization using dictionary: cache intermediate results

Let's iterate through all possible states (section, remaining_plants) and use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
