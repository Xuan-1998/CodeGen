===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other, then solve them in order from left to right, considering each plant's position and species.

The state can be defined as dp[i][k][j], where dp[i][k][j] is the minimum number of replanting for the first i plants, considering k replantings and j sections. The base case would be when there are no more replantings left (k = 0), in which case we simply count the number of species that don't match their section yet.

The recursive formula can be formulated as follows:

dp[i][k][j] = min(dp[i-1][k-1][j-1] + (s_i != j) if s_i == j or k > 0, dp[i-1][k][j], dp[i-1][k-1][j+1] + (s_i != j+1))

This formula considers the current plant and its position. If it's in its correct section or there are no more replantings left, we move on to the next plant. Otherwise, we consider two options: either keep the same number of replanting or add one more.

Finally, we return dp[n-1][m-1][0] as the minimum number of replantings needed.
