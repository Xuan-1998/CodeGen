===BEGIN PLAN===
The key insight is that the optimal solution relies on rearranging plants within each species group rather than swapping entire sections.

To define the state as (x_i, s) where x_i is the position of the ith plant and s is its species. This allows us to track which plants have been processed and consider only those that remain to be placed.

Consider the state (left, right) representing the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted for all plants to the left of x_left and all plants to the right of x_right. This is the most critical part: we can use this state to determine whether moving a plant from its current position to another section will actually reduce the number of plants that need to be replanted.

Use a dictionary-based memoization approach where the key is the state and the value is the result, updating the result only when necessary. This ensures that we don't revisit the same subproblem multiple times and can take advantage of previously computed results.

As we iterate through each plant, consider placing it in the section corresponding to its species. If this would increase the number of plants that need to be replanted compared to leaving it where it is, then we should leave it as is. Otherwise, place it in the correct section and update the state accordingly.

Finally, initialize the result with the initial state (0, 0) representing the case where there are no plants yet, and return this value at the end.
