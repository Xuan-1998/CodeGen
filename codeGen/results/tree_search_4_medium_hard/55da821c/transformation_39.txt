===BEGIN PLAN===
Considering the problem as a sequence of decisions, where each decision depends on the previous ones, we can use memoization to store and reuse previously computed results.

A pair consisting of the current section number (1 to m) and the total number of plants placed in that section (from 0 to n) defines the state.

To define transitions based on whether the current plant should be placed in the current section or a new one. We can use the following rules:

* If the current plant is of species i, place it in the current section if and only if there are plants of species less than or equal to i already in this section.
* Otherwise, create a new section for this plant.

Using dynamic programming with 2D array to store minimum replanting for each pair of (section, total_plants), where the value at state (i, j) represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted if we have already placed i-1 sections and there are j plants left to place.

Initialize the DP table with infinite values and the base case (m-1, 0) as 0.
For each plant, iterate through all possible sections and calculate the minimum replanting using the transition rules. Update the DP table accordingly.

Finally, return the value at state (1, n), which represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted.
