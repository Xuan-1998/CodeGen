===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other. For each plant, consider two options: either it remains in its current position, or it is replanted to the beginning of its corresponding section.

Define the state as a tuple (i, j) representing the number of plants replanted in the first i sections for the j-th species. Initialize dp[i][j] = 0 for all i, j.

Use 2D dynamic programming with separate tables for each species to minimize the number of plants that need to be replanted.

For each plant, iterate from left to right and calculate the minimum number of replantings needed considering the two options above. This can be done by iterating over all previous plants of the same species and selecting the option that results in fewer replantings.
