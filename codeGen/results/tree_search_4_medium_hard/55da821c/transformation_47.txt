===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other, then solve them in order from left to right, considering each plant's position and species.
The state can be defined as a tuple (i, j) representing the number of plants replanted in the first i sections for the j-th species.
], [
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + 1, dp[i-1][j]) when i > 0 and k != j
Employ bottom-up tabulation by iterating through all possible states and filling up the table in order.
For each plant at index i, update the state dp[i][s_i] to the minimum of the current replanted count plus one (if the species is different from the previous section) or the previous replanted count for the same species
