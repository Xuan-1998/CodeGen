===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other, then solve them in order from left to right, considering each plant's position and species.

The state can be defined as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of plants replanted to achieve the desired arrangement for the first i plants and j-th species.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + (x_i - x_{i-1}) / (k - j) if s_i == k, dp[i-1][j]) for all k from 1 to m

Consider edge cases: 
- If i is equal to 0 or less than 0, return 0 as there are no plants to replant.
- If j is equal to 0, return the minimum number of plants replanted for the first i-1 plants.

Implement bottom-up dynamic programming where you start from the smallest problem and gradually build up to larger ones.

For each plant, consider all possible sections it can be placed in. The cost of placing a plant in the j-th section is the distance between the current plant's position and the previous plant's position divided by (j - s_i). Add this cost to the minimum number of plants replanted for the first i-1 plants.

The final answer will be dp[n][m], which represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted to achieve the desired arrangement.
