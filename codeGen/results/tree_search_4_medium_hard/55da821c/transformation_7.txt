===BEGIN PLAN===
The overlapping subproblems arise from the fact that, given a certain set of plants already replanted, we need to decide which plant to move next. This is a classic example of a dynamic programming problem.

State: (number of replanted plants), Transition: (increment the state by 1 if the current plant is not of the same species as the previous one)

We can use a dictionary to memoize the recursive function, where each key is a tuple representing the number of replanted plants and the current section, and the value is the minimum number of replanted plants needed for that state.

To further improve the plan, we can consider using a priority queue instead of a dictionary, as the problem involves minimizing the number of replanted plants. This would allow us to quickly find the optimal solution for each subproblem.

Edge cases to consider: what if there is only one plant or one species? What if all plants are of the same species?
