===BEGIN PLAN===
We will use memoization to solve this problem.

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted to rearrange the first i plants into m sections, with j plants remaining to be arranged.

1. Initialize a 2D table dp of size (n+1) x (m+1), where n is the total number of plants and m is the number of species.
2. For each section k from 1 to m:
   - Iterate over all possible numbers of remaining plants j from m-1 down to 0.
   - Initialize the minimum number of replanting for this combination as infinity.
   - Iterate over all possible placements of the current species in the previous sections (i.e., from 1 to k-1).
     - Calculate the cost of rearranging the plants in the current section and the remaining plants, given the placement of the current species.
     - Update the minimum number of replanting as the minimum between the current value and the calculated cost.
   - Store the result in dp[i][j].
3. Return dp[n][0], which represents the minimum number of replantings needed to arrange all plants into m sections.
