===BEGIN PLAN===
The goal is to minimize the number of plants that need to be replanted. This can be achieved by grouping all plants of the same species together and minimizing the number of replantings within each group.
To solve this problem, we'll use dynamic programming with memoization.

Define dp[i][s] as the minimum number of replantings needed up to the i-th plant with the last species being s. The base case is when i is equal to n (the total number of plants), in which case there are no more replantings.
The recursive case considers two possibilities: either we don't move any plants and leave them in their current positions, or we move all plants of the same species as the last plant that was relocated. The minimum number of replantings is then the minimum of these two cases.

Here's how you can implement this idea in Python:
