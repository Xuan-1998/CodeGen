===BEGIN PLAN===
We can create a DP table with dimensions m x (n+1), where each cell [i][j] represents the minimum number of replanting needed to place j plants in i sections. 
A pair consisting of the current section number and the number of remaining plants to place (from 0 to n) in that section.

We will fill up the DP table by iterating over the given plants, using previous decisions to inform current ones.
For each plant, we consider all possible placements for this plant. We can either put it into the current section or start a new section for it. 
We calculate the minimum number of replanting needed in both cases and choose the one with less replanting.

At the end of the process, the value at cell [m][n] will represent the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted to achieve the desired arrangement.
