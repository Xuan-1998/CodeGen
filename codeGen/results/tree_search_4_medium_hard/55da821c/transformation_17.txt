===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming with memoization.

State: A boolean array dp[] of size m, where dp[i] represents whether species i is placed in its respective section or not. The state also includes the current position p and the number of replants needed nr.

Transition Relationship:
- If a plant of species i is already placed in its respective section, then the minimum number of replants needed remains the same.
- If a plant of species i is not yet placed in its respective section, we have two options: either place it in the current section or start a new section for it. We choose the option that requires fewer replants.

Tabulation:
We create a 2D array dp[] of size (m+1) x (n+1), where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of replants needed to place the first j plants in their respective sections such that the species at position i is placed in its respective section. The state also includes the current position p and the number of replants needed nr.

Base Case: 
dp[0][j] = j, for 0 <= j <= n-1 (all plants need to be replanted).

Recurrence Relation:
For 1 <= i <= m and 1 <= j <= n:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + (i == k ? 0 : 1), dp[m][j])

The minimum number of replants needed is stored in dp[m][n].

This plan takes into account edge cases, such as when there are no plants or only one species.
