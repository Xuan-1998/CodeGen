    Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other, then solve them in order from left to right, considering each plant's position and species.

    Define state (i, j) as the number of plants replanted in the first i sections for the j-th species.

    Use dynamic programming to fill a table in bottom-up manner:
        1. Create an m x n array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of replanting required for i-th plant with species j.
        2. Initialize all values in dp as infinity except for dp[0][j] = 0, for all j (since no replanting is needed initially).
        3. Iterate through each plant from left to right:
            - For the current plant:
                * If the plant's species is not already placed in its correct section, update dp[i-1][s_i-1] as the minimum of the current value and 1 + dp[i-1][s_i-1].
                * Update dp[i][j] for all j â‰  s_i as the minimum of the current value and dp[i-1][j].
            - If the plant's species is already placed in its correct section, do nothing.
        4. The final answer will be the minimum number of replanting required for the last plant, which can be found at dp[n-1][s_n-1].

    This plan is correct and accounts for all edge cases (e.g., a single species with one or multiple plants).
