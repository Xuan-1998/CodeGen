===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other, then solve them in order from left to right, considering each plant's position and species.

The state can be defined as a dictionary {species: count} where count is the number of plants replanted for that species so far.
Formulating state as dp, where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of replanting for the first i plants to put them in j sections.

dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]; 
dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of replanting for the first i plants to put them in j sections. 

For each plant, iterate through the species and find the minimum number of replanting by considering each possible section it can be placed into.

To do this efficiently, use a priority queue to always prioritize the next plant that needs to be replanted based on its position and species.

Then, for each plant, try placing it in each possible section, updating dp[i][j] accordingly. If placing the plant in a particular section requires more replanting than what's currently stored in dp[i][j], then update it with the new minimum number of replanting required.

Finally, return the value stored in dp[n][m] which represents the total minimum number of replanting for all plants to be placed into m sections.
