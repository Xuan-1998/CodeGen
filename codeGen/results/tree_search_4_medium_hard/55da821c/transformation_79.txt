===BEGIN PLAN===
The key insight is that the optimal solution relies on rearranging plants within each species group rather than swapping entire sections. This could be approached through a dynamic programming bottom-up approach.

To define the state as (x, s) where x is the position of the ith plant and s is its species.

Consider the state (left, right) representing the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted for all plants to the left of x_left and all plants to the right of x_right.

Implement a 1D DP table where state i represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted for all plants up to i. Initialize the DP table with values corresponding to the initial state, then iteratively update the states based on the following recurrence relation:

- For each plant at position x_i and species s_i:
  - If there are no plants of species s_i to the left of x_i, the number of replanted plants is the same as for the previous state.
  - If there are plants of species s_i to the left of x_i, consider placing a border at this point. The new DP value would be the minimum of:
    * The current DP value
    * The number of replanted plants required if all plants to the right of x_i were moved into the section to its left
  - Update the state i with the minimum value

The final answer is the value at the last state in the DP table.
