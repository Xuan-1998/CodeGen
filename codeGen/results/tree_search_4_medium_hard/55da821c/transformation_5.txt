===BEGIN PLAN===
The overlapping subproblems arise from the fact that, given a certain set of plants already replanted, we need to decide which plant to move next. This is a classic example of a dynamic programming problem.

State: (section, number of replanted plants)
Transition: (if the current plant's species is equal to the section, do nothing; otherwise, increment the section and reset the number of replanted plants to 1)

The plan seems correct so far. To improve it, we can use memoization to store the minimum replanting steps for each state and avoid redundant calculations.

Potential issues with the plan include:

- Handling edge cases: What if all plants are already in their respective sections? Or what if there's only one section left?
- Overlapping subproblems: We need to ensure that our dynamic programming approach correctly handles the case where multiple plants can be replanted to achieve the same arrangement.

To address these issues, we can add base cases for the edge cases and make sure our recursive function properly handles overlapping subproblems by storing the minimum replanting steps in a memoization table.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
