===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other, then solve them in order from left to right, considering each plant's position and species.

The state can be defined as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of plants replanted to achieve the desired arrangement for the first i plants and j-th species.

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + (x_i - x_{i-1}) / (k - j) if s_i == k, dp[i-1][j]) for all k from 1 to m

The plan seems correct. To improve the plan, consider using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems instead of recomputing them. This can significantly reduce the time complexity.

To handle edge cases, ensure that the initial values of the dp array are set correctly and that the base case for the dynamic programming is handled properly.

Also, consider sorting the plants by their positions (x_i) before starting the dynamic programming to minimize the number of comparisons required during the computation.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
