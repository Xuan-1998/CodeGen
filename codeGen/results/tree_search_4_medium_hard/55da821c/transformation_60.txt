===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other, then solve them in order from left to right, considering each plant's position and species.

The state can be defined as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of plants replanted to achieve the desired arrangement for the first i plants and j-th species.

dp[i][0] = 1 (base case: only one plant in the first section)
for each i from 1 to n:
    for each j from 1 to m:
        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + 1 if s_i == k, dp[i-1][j]) for all k from 1 to m

Use a dynamic programming table with dimensions (n, m) where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of plants replanted to achieve the desired arrangement for the first i plants and j-th species.
