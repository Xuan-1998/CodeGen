===BEGIN PLAN===
The overlapping subproblems arise from the fact that, given a certain set of plants already replanted, we need to decide which plant to move next.

The state could be the last plant replanted and its corresponding species. Choose the state as (last_replanted_species, total_plants_replanted), where last_replanted_species is the species of the last plant replanted and total_plants_replanted is the number of plants that need to be replanted.

The transition relationship could be to either replant a new plant or not, based on whether the current plant's species matches the last replanted species or not. 

We can also use memoization to store the results of subproblems as we solve them, reducing the computational complexity.
