===BEGIN PLAN===
The overlapping subproblems arise from the fact that, given a certain set of plants already replanted, we need to decide which plant to move next. This is a classic example of a dynamic programming problem.

The state could be a 2D array dp[i][k] where i represents the number of plants processed and k represents the current section being placed in. The value at dp[i][k] would indicate the minimum number of replanting operations needed to place the first i plants into k sections.

To define the transition relationship, we can consider two options:

* Option 1: Place the next plant in the current section (i.e., increment the count for species s_i).
* Option 2: Start a new section and place the next plant in it (i.e., reset the count for species s_i).

We can use memoization to store the results of subproblems as they are solved, reducing the computational complexity of the algorithm.
