===BEGIN PLAN===
Considering the problem as a sequence of decisions, where each decision depends on the previous ones, we can use memoization to store and reuse previously computed results.

We'll define states as tuples (section, remaining_plants) and transitions based on whether the current plant should be placed in the current section or a new one. We'll initialize the dp array with values for sections 1 to m-1.

For each plant i:
	* If the plant is of species j, we check if placing it in the current section (section) would maintain the desired arrangement.
		+ If yes, update dp[section][remaining_plants] with the minimum number of replanting required for this plant and the remaining plants.
		+ Otherwise, create a new section and update dp[1][n-i-1] accordingly.

The final answer will be the minimum value in dp[m-1][0].
