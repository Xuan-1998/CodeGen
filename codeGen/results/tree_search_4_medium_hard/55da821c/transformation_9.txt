===BEGIN PLAN===
The overlapping subproblems arise from the fact that, given a certain set of plants already replanted, we need to decide which plant to move next. This is a classic example of a dynamic programming problem.

The state could be a list of integers representing the number of plants of each species in their respective sections.
To define the transition relationship as follows: if the current plant has the same species as the previous one, then increment the corresponding count in the section being filled; otherwise, start a new section by setting all counts to 1.

Start by initializing a 2D table where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted to achieve the desired arrangement for the first i plants and j sections.

The base case would be when all plants are already arranged (i.e., j = m), in which case no further replanting is needed.

For the dynamic programming recurrence, consider placing the current plant in its optimal section. If it has the same species as the previous one, then increment the count of that species in the section being filled; otherwise, start a new section by setting all counts to 1.

Finally, return the value at dp[n][m], which represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted to achieve the desired arrangement for all plants.
