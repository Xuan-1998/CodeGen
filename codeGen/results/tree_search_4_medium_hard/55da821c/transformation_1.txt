===BEGIN PLAN===
The overlapping subproblems arise from the fact that, given a certain set of plants already replanted, we need to decide which plant to move next. This is a classic example of a dynamic programming problem.

The state could be the number of plants replanted so far, and the current section we are in.
State: (number of replanted plants, section), 
Transition: (replant plant in the next section, increment number of replanted plants if the current plant is not of the same species as the previous one)

Use memoization by storing the minimum number of replanted plants for each possible state in a dictionary.

1. Initialize an empty dictionary dp and set it to store the minimum number of replanted plants for each possible state.
2. For each plant, calculate the minimum number of replanted plants needed to put this plant in its correct section.
3. If the current plant's species is different from the previous one, increment the number of replanted plants by 1 and move on to the next section. Otherwise, just move on to the next section.
4. For each possible state (number of replanted plants, section), calculate the minimum number of replanted plants needed to put all remaining plants in their correct sections.
5. Return the value stored in dp for the final state.

This plan should be correct and efficient. It correctly identifies the problem as a dynamic programming problem and uses memoization to store the results of subproblems. The potential issues with this plan are that it assumes that each section can only hold one species, which is guaranteed by the problem constraints.
