===BEGIN PLAN===
The key insight is that the optimal solution relies on rearranging plants within each species group rather than swapping entire sections. This could be approached through a dynamic programming bottom-up approach.

To define the state as (x_i, s) where x_i is the position of the ith plant and s is its species.

The state can be formulated as follows: dp[i][s] represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted for the first i plants and species s. The transition relationship involves moving a plant from one section to another, considering the temperature requirements. This means that dp[i][s] depends on dp[j][s'] where j < i and s' is the previous species.

The plan can be broken down into steps:

1. Initialize a 2D table with dimensions (n+1) * m, filled with infinity or some large value.
2. For each plant from left to right:
    - Iterate over all species
    - If the current plant belongs to the current species, update dp[i][s] by considering the minimum number of replanting required for the previous plants and sections
3. The final answer is stored in dp[n][s] where s is the last species

This plan appears to be correct and provides a clear approach to solve the problem.

The potential issues with this plan include:
- What if there are multiple optimal solutions? How can we ensure that the dynamic programming table captures all possible arrangements?
- How do we handle the edge case when n=m (i.e., only one species)?

To improve the plan, consider adding a step to validate the answer or considering more advanced techniques such as memoization.
