===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using Dynamic Programming, we'll create a dictionary to store intermediate results.

We can define our state as (section_num, remaining_plants), where section_num is the number of the current section and remaining_plants is the number of plants still to be placed in that section. Our goal is to find the minimum cost for each possible state.

For each pair (i, j) representing the current state, with i being the current section number and j being the number of remaining plants:

1. Initialize a dictionary dp to store intermediate results.
2. Create a base case: when there are no more plants left to place (j = 0), the minimum cost is simply 0, as we don't need to replant any plants.
3. Iterate over all possible previous states (k, l) where k < i and l < j:
   - Calculate the cost for placing a plant of species k+1 in the current section: dp[k][l-1] + 1
   - If this cost is less than the minimum cost for the current state, update dp[i][j]
4. Add the base case to our dictionary.

To find the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted, start by initializing a variable min_replanted and set it to the minimum cost for the initial state (1, n).

Finally, return the value of min_replanted.
