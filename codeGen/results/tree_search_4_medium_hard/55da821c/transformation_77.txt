The key insight is that the optimal solution relies on rearranging plants within each species group rather than swapping entire sections. This could be approached through a dynamic programming bottom-up approach.

To define the state as (x, s) where x is the position of the ith plant and s is its species.

Consider using a 2D DP table where state (i, j) represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted for the first i plants with species up to j.

Let's initialize the base cases: dp(0, 0) = 0 and dp(i, j) = infinity for any i < m or j > 1. This represents that we have no plants rearranged yet or we're trying to move a plant from species j+1.

Now, let's fill up the DP table in a bottom-up manner: for each pair (i, j), find the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted considering all possible species s <= j and position x < i. This can be done by iterating over all species and positions from 0 to i-1, calculating the cost of rearranging the ith plant with species s into section j, and adding it to the current minimum.

The final answer will be dp(n, m).
