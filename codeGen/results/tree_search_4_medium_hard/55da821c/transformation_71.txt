===BEGIN PLAN===
The key insight is that the optimal solution relies on rearranging plants within each species group rather than swapping entire sections. This could be approached through a dynamic programming bottom-up approach.

Define state as (i, s) where i is the current position and last_s is the species of the last plant at this position.
This allows us to track the number of plants that need to be replanted for each possible state.

Dynamically create a 2D table dp[i][s] using nested loops. The outer loop iterates over all positions i from left to right, and the inner loop iterates over all species s from 1 to m.
In this cell, store the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted for each possible state (i, s).
This value can be calculated by considering two possibilities: either there is a border at position i, or there isn't.

If there is no border at position i, then all plants up to i are in their correct section. So, the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted is equal to the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted for the state (i-1, s) plus 1.
Otherwise, if there is a border at position i, then we need to consider two possibilities: either all plants up to i are in their correct section, or some plants need to be replanted. We choose the option that results in fewer plants being replanted.

The final answer is dp[n-1][m], which represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted for the last position and species m.
