===BEGIN PLAN===
The overlapping subproblems arise from the fact that, given a certain set of plants already replanted, we need to decide which plant to move next.
This is a classic example of a dynamic programming problem.

The state could be the number of plants replanted so far, and the current section we are in.

State: (number of replanted plants, section)
Transition:
  - (replant plant in the next section, increment number of replanted plants if the current plant is not of the same species as the previous one)
  - consider all possible moves for each state
Determine the optimal decision for each state using tabulation, filling the table bottom-up from (0, 0) to (m-1, n-2).

The plan seems correct and should give you a good starting point. However, it might be beneficial to add more details about how you will handle the edge cases, such as what happens when all plants are of the same species or when there is only one plant left.
