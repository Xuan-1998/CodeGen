    Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other, then solve them in order from left to right, considering each plant's position and species.

    The state can be defined as a tuple (i, j) representing the minimum number of plants replanted for the first i sections when the last planted species is the j-th one.

    Initialize a 2D array dp with size (m+1, m+1) where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of plants replanted for the first i sections when the last planted species is the j-th one.

    For each plant from left to right:
        Get its position x and the corresponding species s.
        Update the state by considering two possibilities: 
            1. The current plant is placed in the section it belongs to (i.e., the i-th section if s = i). This can be calculated as dp[i-1][s-1] + (x - leftmost_x_of_s).
            2. The current plant is not placed in its own section, and instead, a border is placed at x. This can be calculated as dp[min(i-1, m-s)][j-1].
        Update dp[i][j] with the minimum of these two possibilities.

    Return dp[m][m] as the final answer.
