===BEGIN PLAN===
The state could be the number of replanted plants, and the current section we are in.
State: (number of replanted plants), Transition: 
  - If the current plant is not of the same species as the previous one, increment the state by 1
  - If the current plant is of the same species as the previous one, do nothing

The idea is to implement dynamic programming by iterating over all states and sections. We can initialize a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of replanted plants for i replanted and j sections.

Here's how we can iterate:

- Start from (0, 1) with 0 replanted plants in 1 section
- For each plant:
  - Check if it's not of the same species as the previous one
    - If yes, increment the state by 1 and update dp[i+1][j]
  - Otherwise, do nothing
  - Update j to be the next section number

The final answer would be dp[n][m]
