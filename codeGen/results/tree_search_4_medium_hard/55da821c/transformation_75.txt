===BEGIN PLAN===
The key insight is that the optimal solution relies on rearranging plants within each species group rather than swapping entire sections. This could be approached through a dynamic programming bottom-up approach.

To define the state as (i, last_s) where i is the current position and last_s is the species of the last plant that was relocated.
The state can be represented as (i, last_s, dp) where i is the current position, last_s is the species of the last plant that was relocated, and dp is a dynamic programming table storing the minimum number of replantings needed to achieve the desired arrangement up to this point.

Create a memoization dictionary mapping states to their corresponding minimum replanting counts. Initialize all states as not visited.

Iterate through each position i from 1 to n.
For each position, iterate through each species s from 1 to m.
If the plant at position i is of species s:
Check if we have already visited this state (i, last_s) in memoization dictionary.
If yes, return dp[i-1][last_s] as the minimum replanting count up to this point. Otherwise:

Calculate the number of plants that need to be replanted by rearranging all plants within species s from i to n.
This is the difference between the actual position of the last plant in this species and the ideal position for this species.

Update memoization dictionary with the current state and its minimum replanting count.
Update dp[i][s] as the sum of the minimum replanting count up to the previous point (i-1) plus the number of plants that need to be replanted by rearranging all plants within species s from i to n.

Finally, return dp[n][0] as the minimum number of replantings needed.
