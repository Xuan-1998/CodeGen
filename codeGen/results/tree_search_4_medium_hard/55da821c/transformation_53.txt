===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other, then solve them in order from left to right, considering each plant's position and species.

The state can be defined as a dictionary {species: count} where count is the number of plants replanted for that species so far.
Formulate state as dp, where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of replanting for the first i plants to put them in j sections, considering previously computed solutions.

dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]; 
dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of replanting for the first i plants to put them in j sections by reusing previously computed solutions.

For each plant, consider all possible sections it can be placed in. The cost is the difference between the current section and the desired section.
Choose the section that results in the lowest cost and update dp[i][j].

The final answer is the minimum number of replanting for the first n plants to put them in m sections.
