===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other, then solve them in order from left to right, considering each plant's position and species.

The state can be defined as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of plants replanted to achieve the desired arrangement for the first i plants and j-th species.
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][s_i] if i > 0, min(dp[i-1][k] + 1 if s_i == k, dp[i-1][j]) for all k from 1 to m

Create a separate DP table for each species and iterate through the plants in order
dp[0][j] = 0 for all j from 1 to m (base case)

Initialize an array res[] where res[j] is the minimum number of replanting for j-th species
for i from n-1 down to 0:
    for j from 1 to m:
        if s_i == j: 
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][s_i]
        else:
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + 1, dp[i-1][j]) for all k from 1 to m
res[] is the minimum number of replanting for each species

Return res[m]
