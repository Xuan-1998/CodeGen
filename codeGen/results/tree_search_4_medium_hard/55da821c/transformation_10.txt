===BEGIN PLAN===
The overlapping subproblems arise from the fact that, given a certain set of plants already replanted, we need to decide which plant to move next.

The state could be a dictionary where the keys are species numbers and values are lists of booleans indicating whether each section has been placed with that species.
To define the transition relationship, consider two cases: 
1. The current plant is of the same species as the previous one, in which case we can continue filling the current section.
2. The current plant is of a different species than the previous one, in which case we need to start a new section.

Use memoization to store previously computed values and allow quick lookups for subproblems. This will help reduce the number of recursive calls.

To improve the plan, consider using a more efficient data structure instead of booleans for the lists in the dictionary. For example, you could use integers representing the current section number for each species.
Also, think about how to handle edge cases like when there are not enough sections to place all plants or when some species have no plants.

The plan appears to correctly identify the key aspects of the problem and potential solutions. With memoization and careful handling of edge cases, this plan should be a good starting point for solving the problem.
