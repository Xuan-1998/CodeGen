===BEGIN PLAN===
The overlapping subproblems arise from the fact that, given a certain set of plants already replanted, we need to decide which plant to move next. This is a classic example of a dynamic programming problem.

State: (section, number of replanted plants)
Transition:
    if the current plant's species is equal to the section, do nothing;
    otherwise, increment the section and reset the number of replanted plants to 1

Utilize a dictionary to store the state values as keys and their corresponding minimum replanting steps as values. This can be updated recursively or iteratively.

Initialize dp dictionary with base cases:
    for i in range(m): dp[(i, 0)] = 0
    for i in range(1, m+1): dp[(m, i)] = i

For each plant from left to right:
    (section, replanted) = previous section and replanted plants
    current_species = species of the current plant
    if current_species == section:
        dp[(section, replanted+1)] = min(dp[(section, replanted+1)], dp[(section, replanted)] + 1)
    else:
        for i in range(section-1, -1, -1):
            dp[(i+1, replanted+1)] = min(dp[(i+1, replanted+1)], dp[(i, replanted)] + 1)
    result = min(dp.values()) - 1
===END PLAN===
