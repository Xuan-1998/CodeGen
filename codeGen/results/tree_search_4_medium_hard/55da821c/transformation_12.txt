===BEGIN PLAN===
The state could be a list of integers representing the number of plants replanted in each section.
Consider defining the state as the current section and the transition relationship being whether to move to the next section or not.
Define a 1D DP table where dp[i] represents the minimum number of replants required for i plants. 
The base case would be dp[0] = 0, since there are no plants that need to be replanted.
For each plant i, consider whether it should be placed in its current section or moved to a different section based on the temperature requirement.
Move the plant if and only if moving it to the correct section would reduce the total number of replants required. 
The transition relationship would be the minimum number of replants required for plants 1 through i-1, plus either the number of replants required for plants 0 through i-1 and placing this plant in its correct section or the number of replants required for plants 1 through i-2 and moving this plant to its correct section.
The final answer would be dp[n], where n is the total number of plants.
