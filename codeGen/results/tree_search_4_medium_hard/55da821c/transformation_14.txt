===BEGIN PLAN===
The state could be an integer representing the current species being processed, and the transition relationship being the number of plants that need to be replanted for this species.

Initialize the DP table with base cases: dp[0] = 0 (no plants replanted), where dp[i] represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted to achieve the desired arrangement for the first i plants.

Fill up the DP table iteratively:
    For each plant from left to right:
        If the current species is different from the previous one, update dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-1] + 1) (replant all plants of this new species).
        Else if the current plant's species matches the previous one, update dp[i] = dp[i-1] (no replanting needed for the same species).

The final answer is dp[n-1] (the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted for all n plants).
