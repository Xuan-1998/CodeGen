===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the problem as a sequence of decisions, where each decision depends on the previous ones. We can use memoization to store and reuse previously computed results.

A pair consisting of the current section number and the number of remaining plants to place (from 0 to n) in that section is sufficient to describe the state.

To use DP to keep track of the minimum cost for each possible state, consider that placing a plant in an existing section has a different cost than creating a new section. This can be represented as two arrays: one for the number of plants placed in each section and another for the number of sections created.

Use a memoization decorator to store and reuse previously computed results, with the function signature being (n: int, m: int) -> int.

For each state (section number and remaining plants), calculate the minimum cost by considering two options:

    1. Place the current plant in an existing section.
    2. Create a new section for the current plant.

Calculate the minimum cost for both options and take the one with the lower cost.

Update the memoization table with the calculated result.

The final answer is the minimum cost for the state (n, m), which represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted to achieve the desired arrangement.
