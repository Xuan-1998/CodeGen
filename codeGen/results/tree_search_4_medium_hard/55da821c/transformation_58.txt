===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other, then solve them in order from left to right, considering each plant's position and species.

The state can be defined as dp[i][k] where dp[i][k] is the minimum number of replantings for the first i plants, considering k sections.

Formulating state as dp[i][k][j], where dp[i][k][j] is the minimum number of replanting for the first i plants, considering k replantings and j species. This will allow us to correctly handle the case when a section can hold multiple species.

Implement memoization using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computations.

For each plant, consider all possible placements in the different sections. Choose the placement that minimizes the number of replantings considering the current k replantings and j species.

Finally, return dp[n][m] as it represents the minimum number of replanting for all n plants and m sections.
