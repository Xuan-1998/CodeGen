===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other, then solve them in order from left to right, considering each plant's position and species.

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum number of replantings needed for the first i plants to be placed in sections 1 to j. The base case is when j = 0, there are no sections, so the answer is 0.

Formulate state as (species_count_map, section_index), where species_count_map is a dictionary mapping each species to its count and section_index is the current section index. This state represents the number of replantings needed for plants in previous sections to be rearranged into the current section.

To use a dictionary as a memoization table to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computation.

For each plant, calculate dp[i][j] by considering two options: either place this plant in its own section (j+1) or merge it with the previous plants in the same species. If there are any mismatches between species and sections, we need to replant some plants to fix this. This can be calculated by iterating over all plants and counting how many replantings are needed.

Return dp[n][m] as the final answer.
