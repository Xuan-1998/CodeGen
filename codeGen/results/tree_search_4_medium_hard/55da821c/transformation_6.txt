===BEGIN PLAN===
The overlapping subproblems arise from the fact that, given a certain set of plants already replanted, we need to decide which plant to move next. This is a classic example of a dynamic programming problem.

The state could be the number of plants replanted so far, and the current section we are in.
State: (number of replanted plants), Transition: (increment the state by 1 if the current plant is not of the same species as the previous one)

Use a 2D array to store the minimum number of replants needed for each state and section. Initialize the base cases with 0, representing that no replanting is needed initially.

For each new plant, calculate the minimum number of replants by considering all possible moves (replant or not) and choosing the one that results in the minimum number of replants.

The optimal solution would be to find the minimum number of replants for the current state and section, which can be achieved by taking into account the plants already replanted and the current plant's species.

To handle edge cases, ensure that the initial conditions are properly handled. For instance, if there is only one plant in a specific species, it should not require any replanting.
