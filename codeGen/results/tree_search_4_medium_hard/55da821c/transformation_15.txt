===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach is correct in identifying the problem as one that can be solved using this technique.

To define the state:
The state could be a pair (species_sectioned, last_planted_species), where species_sectioned indicates which species have been placed in their respective sections and last_planted_species represents the most recently planted species.

Transition relationship:
To move from one state to another, we can consider two options: adding the next plant to an existing section or starting a new one. This is represented by the transition function delta that takes as input the current state (species_sectioned, last_planted_species) and returns the minimum number of replants needed to achieve the desired arrangement for the next plant.

DP table:
The dynamic programming table can be implemented as a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of replants needed to section i-th species given that the last planted species was j. The base case is when we have already sectioned all species, in which case no more replants are needed.

Edge cases:
The plan should include edge cases for initial and terminal states. The initial state would be a state where none of the plants have been placed yet (species_sectioned = [False]*m). The terminal state is when all plants have been sectioned correctly.
