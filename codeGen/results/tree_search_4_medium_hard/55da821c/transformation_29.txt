===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the problem as a sequence of decisions where each decision depends on the previous ones. We can use memoization to store and reuse previously computed results.

The current temperature profile, i.e., the number of plants at each temperature level (m+1 integers), with all plants initially having their own unique temperature.

Consider a state as the current section, the number of remaining plants to be rearranged, and the current species. The state can be represented by a tuple (section, remaining_plants, species).

A combination of both tabulation and memoization by creating a 3D table where each cell also stores the result of the previous computation:

- Create a 3D array dp[1..m][0..n][1..m] where:
	+ dp[i][j][k] represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted in order to achieve the desired arrangement for the first i sections, with j remaining plants to be rearranged, and k as the current species.
- Initialize the base cases: dp[0][j][k] = 0 for all j and k (since no replanting is needed when there are no sections).
- Fill up the table by iterating over the sections, remaining plants, and species:
	+ For each cell, calculate the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted based on the current state and the previous computation.
- Finally, return dp[m][n][m], which represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted in order to achieve the desired arrangement for all sections.
