===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other, then solve them in order from left to right, considering each plant's position and species.

The state can be defined as dp[i][k] where dp[i][k] is the minimum number of replantings for the first i plants, considering k replantings.
Formulate state as follows:
- Initialize dp[0][0] = 0
- For all i from 1 to n and k from 0 to min(i-1, m-1):
    - If species of plant i is not in section j where j <= k < j+1:
        - Calculate the minimum number of replantings by considering two cases: 
          - Replanting plant i into its correct section (j) with cost dp[i-1][k]
          - Not replanting plant i and continue from the current situation (dp[i-1][k])
        - Update dp[i][k] = min(cost + 1, dp[i-1][k])

Return dp[n][m-1]
