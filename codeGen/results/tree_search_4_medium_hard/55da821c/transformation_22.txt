===BEGIN PLAN===
The state could be (total_species_replanted, last_plant_section), where total_species_replanted is the number of species that have been replanted and last_plant_section is the section where we are currently placing a new plant.

Define dp as a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of replantings required to place the first i plants into j sections. The base case would be when all plants are placed, so dp[n][m] would give us the minimum number of replantings required.

The transition relationship could be as follows:
- If the current plant's species matches the one in the last_plant_section, then we have two options: 
  1. Move to the next section (dp[i-1][j+1] + 1) if it is not already full (last_plant_section != j), or
  2. Stay in the same section (dp[i-1][j])
- If the current plant's species does not match the one in the last_plant_section, then we have only one option: 
  Move to the next section (dp[i-1][j+1] + 1)

The dynamic programming approach would be to fill up dp table row by row starting from the base case. For each cell dp[i][j], calculate the minimum number of replantings required considering all possible options for placing the i-th plant into j sections.
