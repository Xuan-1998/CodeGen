===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a 2D DP table dp[m+1][n+1] where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of replantings required when we have i sections and j plants, where all plants are initially in their own unique section.

The base case is when there's only one section (i = 1), then the minimum number of replantings is simply n - m (since we need to put each plant in its corresponding species' section).

For i > 1 and j = 0, dp[i][j] is still 0 since there are no plants to be replanted.

The transition from dp[i-1][j] to dp[i][j] can be calculated as follows:
If the current plant (at index j) belongs to species k where 1 <= k <= i, then we have two options: either keep it in its own section (add 1 to the current number of replantings) or move it to the i-th section (keep the current number of replantings). We choose the option that results in fewer replantings.

This process can be implemented using a bottom-up approach by iterating over all possible values of i and j, updating dp[i][j] based on the previous values and keeping track of the minimum number of replantings required at each step.
