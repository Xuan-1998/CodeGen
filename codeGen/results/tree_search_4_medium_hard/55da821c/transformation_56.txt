===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other, then solve them in order from left to right, considering each plant's position and species.

The state can be defined as (species_count_map, section_index), where species_count_map is a dictionary mapping each species to its count and section_index is the current section index.

To employ a sliding window approach by iterating over the plants from left to right, keeping track of the current section index and updating the state accordingly.

Formally define the base cases:
* Initialize the state as (species_count_map, 0), where species_count_map is an empty dictionary.
* For each plant, if its species is not in the current section's species_count_map, update the state by adding the species to the map with a count of 1.

Define the recurrence relation:
* If the plant's species is already in the current section's species_count_map, increment the count for that species.
* Otherwise, update the state by creating a new section and adding the species to its species_count_map with a count of 1.

To minimize replanting, consider placing m-1 borders at the boundaries between sections. This allows each species to reside in a single section from left to right.

The final answer is the sum of the counts for all species in the last section.
