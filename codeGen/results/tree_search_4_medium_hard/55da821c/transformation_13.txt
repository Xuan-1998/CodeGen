The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization.

Let's define the state as a tuple (replanted, species). replanted represents the number of plants that have been replanted so far. species is an array of booleans indicating which species have been placed in their respective sections.

The transition relationship is defined as follows:
- If the current plant belongs to a species that has not been placed yet, then we can either replant this plant or leave it where it is.
- If the current plant belongs to a species that has already been placed, then we cannot move it anymore.

We can use memoization to store the results of subproblems in a dictionary. The key is the state (replanted, species), and the value is the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted to achieve the desired arrangement.

The base case for the dynamic programming algorithm is when all plants have been replanted. In this case, we simply return the total number of plants.

We can then use a recursive function to calculate the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted. The function takes as input the current state and returns the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted.

Finally, we can use memoization to store the results of subproblems in a dictionary, where the key is the state (replanted, species) and the value is the result.
