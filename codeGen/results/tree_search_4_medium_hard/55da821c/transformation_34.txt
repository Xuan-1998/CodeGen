===BEGIN PLAN===
Considering the problem as a sequence of decisions, where each decision depends on the previous ones, we can use dynamic programming with memoization to store and reuse previously computed results.

The current temperature profile, i.e., the number of plants at each temperature level (m+1 integers), with all plants initially having their own unique temperature. This can be represented as a 2D array dp[m+1][n] where dp[i][j] stores the minimum cost to place m-1 borders such that all species plants up to j reside in section i.

Treat each plant's position and species as independent components of the state, and formulate a transition relationship based on the decision of placing or not placing a border. For example, if we decide to place a border at position x and it is the i-th species, then the new state will be (i+1, x-1) if the plant was previously of the i-th species, or (1, x-1) if the plant was previously of any other species.

Memoizing the function that calculates the cost of placing a border at a given position and species. This can be done using a 2D array dp[m+1][n] where dp[i][j] stores the minimum cost to place m-1 borders such that all species plants up to j reside in section i.

The base case for the dynamic programming will be when there is no border (i.e., i=1) or when all plants have been placed (i=n). In these cases, we can simply count the number of plants that need to be replanted.

Finally, we can use the memoized function to find the minimum cost by iterating over the positions and species of the plants, and for each plant, deciding whether to place a border or not based on the previous decisions and the current temperature profile.
