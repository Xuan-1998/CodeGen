The key insight is that the optimal solution relies on rearranging plants within each species group rather than swapping entire sections. This could be approached through a dynamic programming bottom-up approach.

To define the state as dp[i][s] where i is the current plant index and s is its species. The state can be formulated as follows:
- If i == 0, dp[i][s] = 0 because there are no plants to rearrange.
- Otherwise, consider moving the current plant to each of the m - 1 sections and recursively calculate the minimum number of replanted plants for the remaining plants in that section. The transition relationship involves considering the temperature requirements for each species.

Memoization using a dictionary where memo[(i, s)] = dp[i][s] and recursively update memo.
- Initialize memo[0][s] = 0 for all s because there are no plants to rearrange.
- For i from 1 to n:
	+ For s from 1 to m:
		- Calculate the minimum number of replanted plants by considering moving the ith plant to each of the m - 1 sections and recursively calculate the minimum number of replanted plants for the remaining plants in that section.
		- Update memo[i][s] with the calculated value.

Finally, return memo[n][s] as the minimum number of replanted plants for all plants.
