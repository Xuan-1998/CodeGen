===BEGIN PLAN===
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that are independent of each other, then solve them in order from left to right, considering each plant's position and species.

The state can be defined as a tuple (i, j) representing the number of plants replanted in the first i sections for the j-th species.

Use a 2D table where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of replanting required up to the ith plant, considering only plants of species j.

For each plant, iterate from left to right and calculate the number of replantings required to move all plants of the same species to their designated sections. This can be done by iterating through the species and for each species, calculating the minimum number of replantings required to move all its plants to their designated sections.

This plan seems correct but it lacks a crucial step, which is to consider the previously calculated results while filling up the dp table. The idea is to fill up the dp table in a bottom-up manner, i.e., calculate the result for each cell based on the results of the cells above and to its left.

Another potential issue with this plan is that it does not account for the fact that some species may have already been replanted into their designated sections. Therefore, we should keep track of which species have been placed in their respective sections and only consider the plants of species that have not yet been placed when calculating the minimum number of replantings.

Finally, this plan does not handle edge cases well. For example, what if there is only one plant left? In such a case, we would need to handle it separately.
