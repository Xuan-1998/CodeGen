===BEGIN PLAN===
The state could be the last plant replanted and its corresponding species. Choose the state as (last_replanted_species, total_plants_replanted), where last_replanted_species is the species of the last plant replanted and total_plants_replanted is the number of plants that need to be replanted.
The transition relationship could be to either replant a new plant or not, based on whether the current plant's species matches the last replanted species or not.

Consider implementing a bottom-up dynamic programming approach. Initialize a 2D array dp with dimensions (m+1) x (n+1), where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted if the first j plants are from the first i species.

For each plant, calculate the difference between its species and the last replanted species. If this difference is less than or equal to i-1, then it's possible to replant the current plant in its original position without moving any other plants.

Update dp[i][j] by considering two options: either replant the current plant or not. Replanting the current plant would incur a cost of 1, whereas not replanting it would incur no additional cost.

Use this dynamic programming approach to fill up the dp array, and then return dp[m][n], which represents the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted to achieve the desired arrangement.
