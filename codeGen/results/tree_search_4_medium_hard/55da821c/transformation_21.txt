===BEGIN PLAN===
The state could be (total_species_replanted, current_section), where total_species_replanted is the number of species that have been replanted and current_section is the section where we are currently placing a new plant.

Define the base case as when all plants have been placed. In this case, the minimum number of replanting needed is 0.

For each possible (total_species_replanted, current_section) state:

* If the total_species_replanted equals m, then we know that all species are in their correct sections, so no further replanting is necessary.
* Otherwise, consider two options:
    * Move to the next section: This would require replanting a plant of species (total_species_replanted + 1).
    * Stay in the same section: This would mean that we don't replant this plant, and we can keep exploring further.

The minimum number of replanting needed for this state is the minimum of these two options plus the total number of replanting needed for the previous state (total_species_replanted + 1, current_section).

Memoize the recursive function by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary.
