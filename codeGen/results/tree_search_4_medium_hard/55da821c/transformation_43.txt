===BEGIN PLAN===
Considering the problem as a sequence of decisions, where each decision depends on the previous ones, we can use memoization to store and reuse previously computed results.

A pair consisting of the current section number (from 1 to m) and the number of remaining plants to place (from 0 to n-m+1) in that section.
To use DP to keep track of the minimum cost for each possible state (i.e., number of sections and remaining plants), considering that placing a plant in an existing section has a different cost than creating a new section.

Implement a 2D table where each cell represents the minimum cost for a given state (number of sections and remaining plants).

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum cost to place j plants in i-1 sections, with the last section being of species s_j.
For all 1 <= i <= m and 0 <= j <= n-m+1:

* If there are no more plants to place (i.e., j == 0), the minimum cost is 0.
* Otherwise, consider two options:
    - Place the current plant in the last section, which costs c_s_j. This option would leave i-1 sections and j-1 plants to place.
    - Create a new section for the current plant, which costs some constant c_new_section. This option would leave i+1 sections and j-1 plants to place.

Choose the option that leads to the minimum cost:

dp[i][j] = min( dp[i-1][j-1] + c_s_j, dp[1][j-1] + c_new_section )

The final answer is stored in dp[m][n-m+1].
