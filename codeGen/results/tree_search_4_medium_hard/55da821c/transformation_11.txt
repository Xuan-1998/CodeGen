===BEGIN PLAN===
The state could be a 2D array dp[i][j] where i represents the number of species and j represents the current section being filled (from left to right). Each cell in the array stores the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted to achieve the desired arrangement up to the current section.
To define the base case, we set dp[0][j] = 0 for all j because there are no species to place initially. The transition relationship is defined as follows:
- If the current plant belongs to the same species as the previous one, then we increment the count by the number of plants in this section and add the minimum cost to start a new section.
- If it's a different species, then we just update the count with the minimum cost.

The function memoization can be implemented using dynamic programming. It takes two parameters: i (the current number of species) and j (the current section being filled). The function returns the minimum number of plants that need to be replanted to achieve the desired arrangement up to this point.
To improve the plan, we could use a more efficient data structure for storing the dp array or implement memoization using a hashmap instead of a 2D array.

The potential issue with this plan is that it does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, if n = m and all plants belong to the same species, then we can simply place each plant in its corresponding section without replanting any.
To handle these edge cases, we need to add additional checks at the beginning of the function.

Here's a more detailed plan:
