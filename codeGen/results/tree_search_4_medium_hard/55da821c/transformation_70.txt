This recursive function calculates the minimum number of rearrangements by considering two options:
- Move the current plant to a new section and recursively calculate the minimum number of rearrangements for the remaining plants.
- Keep the current plant in its original section.

The memoization ensures that the function only needs to be calculated once for each state, reducing the time complexity.
