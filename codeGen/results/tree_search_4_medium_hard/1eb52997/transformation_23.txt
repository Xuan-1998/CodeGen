===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.

dp[i][j] represents whether the mirror can be placed at cell (i, j) such that the East side visibility is maintained, considering the presence or absence of rocks in neighboring cells.

Maintaining a count of rock-free cells to the left as a state: The transition relationship can be formulated as:

dp[i][j] = 1 if dp[i-1][j] and cell (i, j) is empty
elif cell (i, j) is empty and there are rocks in none of the previous cells to its left:
    dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(j)) + 1
else: 
    dp[i][j] = 0

This choice ensures that the mirror can only be placed where the East side visibility is maintained.

Utilize memoization to store the computed values of dp and avoid redundant computations by reusing previously computed results.
