===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.

State expression is dp[row][col], where row and col are integers representing the coordinates of a cell. The base case is when there is no rock in the cell, and we recursively check for rocks to the right.

Consider the cell (row, col) and determine if placing a mirror here would allow for an unobstructed view of the East side. The transition function depends on the state of the cells directly to the right.

Create a 2D DP table where dp[row][col] represents whether a mirror can be placed at cell (row, col) to have an unobstructed view of the East side. Fill in the table row by row from top to bottom. For each cell (i, j), check if it's an empty cell and if there are no rocks to the right of this cell. If so, set dp[i][j] to True.
