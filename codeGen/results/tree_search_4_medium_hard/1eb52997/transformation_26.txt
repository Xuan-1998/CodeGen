A top-down approach using memoization could be implemented by defining a function that takes the current cell and direction (East) as inputs. The base case would be when the current cell is at the edge of the grid or has no visible rocks to its East.

State relationships can be defined as follows:

- If the current cell is at the edge of the grid, dp[i][j] = 1
- If there are no rocks visible to the East, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
- If there are rocks visible to the East, dp[i][j] = 0

The state expression is dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to place a mirror at cell (i, j) such that it sees no rocks on the East side.

Define state as dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to place a mirror at cell (i, j) such that it sees no rocks on the East side.

 Define a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary to store intermediate results, and then update the function by iterating over all cells from top to bottom and from left to right.

Memoization is necessary as the same subproblems might be solved multiple times. This will help reduce the time complexity.

The updated plan could look like this:
