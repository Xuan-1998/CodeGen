===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.

The state expression is dp[row][col], where row and col are integers representing the coordinates of a cell. The base case is when there is no rock in the cell, and we recursively check for rocks to the right.

Consider the cell (row, col) and determine if placing a mirror here would allow for an unobstructed view of the East side. The transition function depends on the state of the cells directly to the right.

Create a 2D DP table where dp[row][col] represents whether a mirror can be placed at cell (row, col) to have an unobstructed view of the East side.

1. Initialize the DP table with zeros.
2. For each cell in the grid:
    * If there is no rock in this cell and the cell to its right has already been processed:
        + If the cell to its right allows for an unobstructed view of the East side, then this cell also does.
3. The final answer will be the sum of all dp[row][col] values where col is at the edge of the grid (i.e., N-1).
