===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.
The state expression is dp[i][j], where i represents the row number (0-indexed) and j represents the column number (0-indexed). The value of dp[i][j] is 1 if the cell at position (i, j) can see an empty cell to its East, and 0 otherwise.
dp[i][j] = 1 if grid[i][j] == '.' && all cells in the same row and to the right of (i, j) are also '.'
dp[i][j] = 0 if grid[i][j] == '#'
Use memoization by storing the computed values in a dictionary and updating it as you iterate over the grid.
Initialize dp with zeros.
Iterate over each cell in the grid:
    For each cell (i, j), check its state using the above formula
    If the state is 1, update all cells to its right that are also '.' to have state 1
    Store the updated states in the dictionary
Calculate the final answer by summing up the number of '1's in the last row of dp.
