===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.
Create a bottom-up dynamic programming table where each cell dp[i][j] depends on the values of the cells above and to its left.
The state expression is dp[i][j], where i represents the row number (0-indexed) and j represents the column number (0-indexed). The value of dp[i][j] is 1 if the cell at position (i, j) can see an empty cell to its East, and 0 otherwise.
dp[i][j] = 0 if grid[i][j] == '#'
For each cell dp[i][j], compute its value based on the values of the cells above and to its left:
    If the cell above (i-1,j) is empty (grid[i-1][j] == '.') and the mirror can be placed at 45 degrees in that cell, then consider it as a valid option for dp[i][j]. 
    If the cell to the left (i,j-1) is empty (grid[i][j-1] == '.') and the mirror can be placed at 45 degrees in that cell, then also consider it as a valid option for dp[i][j].
dp[i][0] = 1 if grid[i][0] == '.' and dp[i-1][0] == 1
For the first column (j=0), consider only the above cells.
Finally, initialize the count of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees. Initialize it as 0.
Compute the number of possible options for each cell in the bottom row:
    For each cell dp[i][N-1], where N is the size of the grid, add its value to the total count if the cell is empty (grid[i][N-1] == '.') and the mirror can be placed at 45 degrees.
