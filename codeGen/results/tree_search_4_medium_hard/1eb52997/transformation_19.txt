===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.

dp[i][j] represents whether the mirror can be placed at cell (i, j) such that the East side visibility is maintained, considering the presence or absence of rocks in neighboring cells.

Keeping track of the number of consecutive rock-free cells as a state: The transition relationship can be formulated as dp[i][j] = 1 if the cell at (i, j) is empty and there are rocks in none of the previous cells to its right, else 0. This choice ensures that the mirror can only be placed where the East side visibility is maintained.

Use a 2D array dp to store the state for each cell and each possible previous cell state.

For the initial state, set dp[0][j] = 1 for all j if the top edge of the grid is rock-free, else set it to 0. This ensures that the mirror can be placed at the leftmost cells without any rocks blocking the line of sight.

To update the state for each cell, iterate over each cell from the bottom up and then from left to right. If a cell is empty and there are rocks in none of the previous cells to its right, set dp[i][j] = 1, else set it to 0.

Finally, return the sum of all values in the last column of the dp array, which represents the number of possible options where the mirror can be placed to see on the East side.
