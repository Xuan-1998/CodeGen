A top-down approach using memoization could be implemented by defining a function that takes the current cell and direction (East) as inputs. The base case would be when the current cell is at the edge of the grid or has no visible rocks to its East.

State relationships can be defined as dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + 1 if there are no rocks at the next cell in the East direction, and 0 otherwise. This ensures that we only consider cells where a mirror can be placed without blocking any rocks on the East side.

To avoid counting the same cell multiple times, we would use memoization to store the state values for each cell. The function will return the stored value if it has already been computed.

We start from the top edge of the grid and work our way down, as this ensures that we only consider cells where a mirror can be placed without blocking any rocks on the East side.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = 1 if there are no rocks at the next cell in the East direction, and 0 otherwise. This ensures that we only consider cells where a mirror can be placed without blocking any rocks on the East side.

Edge cases: The plan includes edge cases such as when the current cell is at the edge of the grid or has no visible rocks to its East.
