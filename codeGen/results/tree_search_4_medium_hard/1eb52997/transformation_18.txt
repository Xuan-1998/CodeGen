===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.

dp[i][j] represents whether the mirror can be placed at cell (i, j) such that the East side visibility is maintained, considering the presence or absence of rocks in neighboring cells.

Considering the number of rock-free cells to the right as a state: The transition relationship can be formulated as dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] if the cell at (i, j) is empty and there are no rocks in the cells to its right, else 0. This choice ensures that the mirror can only be placed where the East side visibility is maintained.

Explore tabulation by iterating over the grid from top to bottom and left to right, maintaining a running total of valid placements.
For edge cases: Handle the case when there's no rock-free cell to the right (i.e., the first row or column) and handle the case when the entire grid is empty (i.e., all cells are '.')
