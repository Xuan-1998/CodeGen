===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.
The state expression is dp[i][j], where i represents the row number (0-indexed) and j represents the column number (0-indexed). The value of dp[i][j] is 1 if the cell at position (i, j) can see an empty cell to its East, and 0 otherwise.

dp[i][j] = 
    if grid[i][j] == '.':
        max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j])
    else:
        0

Memoize the function that checks whether a given cell can see an empty cell to its East by storing the results in a dictionary and updating the values as needed.

For each test case, initialize dp with all zeros.
Then, for each cell (i, j), if it's an empty cell, update dp[i][j] based on the maximum visibility of neighboring cells. If it's a rock cell, set dp[i][j] to 0.

Finally, return the sum of all values in dp as the result.
