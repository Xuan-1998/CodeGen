===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.

dp[i][j] represents whether the mirror can be placed at cell (i, j) such that the East side visibility is maintained, considering the presence or absence of rocks in neighboring cells.
Keeping track of the number of consecutive rock-free cells as a state: The transition relationship can be formulated as dp[i][j] = 1 if the cell at (i, j) is empty and there are no rocks in any previous cells to its right; otherwise, dp[i][j] = 0. This choice ensures that the mirror can only be placed where the East side visibility is maintained.

Store the state of each cell as a tuple in a dictionary: dp[(i, j)] = (rock_free_cells, dp[i-1][j]) for rock-free cells and (0, 0) for cells with rocks.

To compute the number of possible options at cell (i, j), iterate over each row from i to N, considering the East side visibility pattern. Initialize a variable count to keep track of the number of consecutive rock-free cells. For each cell in the current row:
    - If the cell is empty and there are no rocks in any previous cells to its right, increment count.
    - If the cell has rocks or the previous row had rocks, reset count to 0.
Update dp[i][j] with the value of count.

Finally, compute the total number of possible options by summing up dp[N-1][j] for all columns j from 0 to N-1. Return this sum as the result.
