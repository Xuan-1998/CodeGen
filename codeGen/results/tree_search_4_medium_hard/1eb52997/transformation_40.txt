===BEGIN PLAN===
A top-down approach using memoization could be implemented by defining a function that takes the current cell and direction (East) as inputs. The base case would be when the current cell is at the edge of the grid or has no visible rocks to its East.

State relationships can be defined as follows:

* dp[(i, j)] stores whether a mirror can be placed at position (i, j) and see all the way to the right without any rocks blocking the line of sight.
* The base case is when i or j reaches N - 1, meaning we've reached the edge of the grid.

View the problem as a grid where each cell has two states: it's either an empty cell that can be seen by a mirror or a rock that cannot. Then formulate the state and transition relationships based on these states:

* If the current cell is empty and there are no rocks to its East, then dp[(i, j)] = True.
* If the current cell is not empty (either rock or mirror), then dp[(i, j)] depends on whether the previous cell in the same row has a mirror that can see all the way to the right without any rocks blocking the line of sight. If it does, then dp[(i, j)] = True.
* If none of the above conditions are met, then dp[(i, j)] = False.

Develop a hybrid approach that combines top-down recursion with memoization. This would involve defining a recursive function that takes the current cell and direction as inputs, and then using memoization to store previously computed values:

* Define a recursive function f(i, j) that returns whether a mirror can be placed at position (i, j) and see all the way to the right without any rocks blocking the line of sight.
* Use memoization to store previously computed values of f(i, j).
* The base case is when i or j reaches N - 1.
