===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.

The state expression is dp[i][j], where i represents the row number (0-indexed) and j represents the column number (0-iterated). The value of dp[i][j] is 1 if the cell at position (i, j) can see an empty cell to its East, and 0 otherwise.

dp[i][j] = 1 if grid[i][j] == '.' && all cells to the East are also '.'
          = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j]) if grid[i][j] == '.'

Create a bottom-up dynamic programming solution using a 2D array, where each cell represents the maximum number of empty cells visible from the current position.

Pre-compute the visibility for all rows. For each row i:
  For each column j:
    If grid[i][j] == '.':
      Set dp[i][j] = 1 if all cells to the East are also '.'
             = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j]) otherwise

Compute the total number of possible options by summing up all values in the last row.
