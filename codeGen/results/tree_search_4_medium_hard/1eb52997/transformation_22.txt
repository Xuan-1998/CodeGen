===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.

dp[i][j] represents whether the mirror can be placed at cell (i, j) such that the East side visibility is maintained, considering the presence or absence of rocks in neighboring cells.

Maintain a count of rock-free cells to the left as a state: The transition relationship can be formulated as dp[i][j] = 1 if the cell at (i, j) is empty and there are no rocks in any previous cell to its left, else 0. This choice ensures that the mirror can only be placed where the East side visibility is maintained.

Implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing dp with zeros and filling it up row-wise, starting from the first row. Initialize the count of possible options for each row as the number of cells in that row. For each cell (i, j) in row i, update the count as the minimum of the previous count and 1 if dp[i][j] is true.

For the edge cases, handle the case where N = 1 by returning 1 if there's an empty cell, else 0.
