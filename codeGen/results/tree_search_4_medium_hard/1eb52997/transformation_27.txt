===BEGIN PLAN===
A top-down approach using memoization can be implemented by defining a function that takes the current cell and direction (East) as inputs. The base case would be when the current cell is at the edge of the grid or has no visible rocks to its East.

State relationships can be defined as the number of empty cells to the East with no rocks blocking the line of sight.

The state expression is dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to place a mirror at cell (i, j) such that it sees no rocks on the East side.

State transition can be achieved by iterating over the cells in the East direction and checking if there are any rocks. If not, increment the state value.

To improve the plan, consider initializing the dp array with zeros or negative infinity to ensure all cells have a valid base case.

The function can be implemented recursively or iteratively using a queue-based approach. The recursive function would explore the grid level by level, storing the results in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

Edge cases include handling grids that are partially empty and those that contain only rocks.
