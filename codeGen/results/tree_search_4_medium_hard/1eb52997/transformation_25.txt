===BEGIN PLAN===
A top-down approach using memoization could be implemented by defining a function that takes the current cell and direction (East) as inputs. The base case would be when the current cell is at the edge of the grid or has no visible rocks to its East. State relationships can be defined as the number of empty cells to the East with no rocks blocking the line of sight.

The state expression is dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to place a mirror at cell (i, j) such that it sees no rocks on the East side. This value depends only on the current cell and the cells to its East, so we can use memoization to store and retrieve values in the dynamic programming table.

We can iterate over each cell in the grid, considering all possible directions from which a mirror could be placed at 45 degrees. For each direction, we check if it's safe to place a mirror (i.e., there are no rocks to its East) and update our state accordingly. The final answer would be the sum of all states where it is safe to place a mirror.

The updated plan:
