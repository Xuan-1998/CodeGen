===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.

dp[i][j] represents whether the mirror can be placed at cell (i, j) such that the East side visibility is maintained, considering the presence or absence of rocks in neighboring cells.
Considering the number of rock-free cells to the right as a state: The transition relationship can be formulated as dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] if the cell at (i, j) is empty and there are no rocks in the cells to its right, else 0. This choice ensures that the mirror can only be placed where the East side visibility is maintained.

Consider using a 2D array with dp[i][j] representing whether cell (i, j) has an unobstructed view to its right.
dp[0][j] = 1 if the cell at (0, j) is empty, else 0
for i from 1 to N-1:
    for j from 0 to N-1:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] if the cell at (i, j) is empty and there are no rocks in the cells to its right, else 0

The number of possible options where a mirror can be placed is then the sum of all dp[N-1][j] for j from 0 to N-1.
