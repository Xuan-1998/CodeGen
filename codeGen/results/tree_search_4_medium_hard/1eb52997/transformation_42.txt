===BEGIN PLAN===
A bottom-up approach using tabulation could be implemented by creating a 2D table where each cell represents the number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees for that specific cell.

The base case would be when the current cell is at the edge of the grid or has no visible rocks to its East. State relationships can be defined as:

* If there are no rocks to the East, the number of possible options is the sum of the number of empty cells in the previous row with no rocks blocking the line of sight.
* If there are rocks to the East:
	+ If the current cell is not blocked by any rock, the number of possible options is the same as if it were at the edge of the grid (i.e., the sum of the number of empty cells in the previous row with no rocks blocking the line of sight).
	+ If the current cell is blocked by a rock, the number of possible options is 0.

The state can be defined as a binary value indicating whether there's a rock or not on the East side from that specific cell. This allows for efficient computation and reduction of redundant calculations.

To handle edge cases:
* For the first row, since there are no previous rows to consider, the base case would be when there are no rocks to its East.
* For cells at the leftmost column, since they have no cells to their West, the number of possible options is always 1 (i.e., the cell can be treated as if it were at the edge of the grid).

The plan remains correct. It covers all possible cases and has a clear base case.

No potential issues or room for improvement were identified.
