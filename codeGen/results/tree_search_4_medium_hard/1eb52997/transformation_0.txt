===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.

The state expression is dp[i][j], where i represents the row number (0-indexed) and j represents the column number (0-indexed). The value of dp[i][j] is 1 if the cell at position (i, j) can see an empty cell to its East, and 0 otherwise.

dp[i][j] = 1 if grid[i][j] == '.' and not any(grid[k][j] == '#' for k in range(i+1, N))

Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming state values. The time complexity is O(N^2), where N is the size of the grid.

For each cell (i, j) in the grid:
    If the cell is empty and there are no rocks to its East, mark it as a valid position for the mirror.
    If the cell is not empty or has rocks to its East, do not consider it for placing the mirror.
