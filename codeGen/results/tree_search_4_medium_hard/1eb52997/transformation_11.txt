===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.

State expression is dp[row][col], where row and col are integers representing the coordinates of a cell. The base case is when there is no rock in the cell, and we recursively check for rocks to the right.

Consider the cell (row, col) and determine if placing a mirror here would allow for an unobstructed view of the East side. The transition function depends on the state of the cells directly to the right.

Use memoization to store the results of subproblems as you solve them. Initialize a 2D array dp with zeros, where dp[row][col] represents the number of mirror placement options for cell (row, col). Fill the dp array by iterating over each cell in the grid and updating the state according to the rules.

Return the total count of cells that satisfy the condition for each test case. This is equivalent to summing up all elements in the dp array.
