===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.

dp[i][j] represents whether the mirror can be placed at cell (i, j) such that the East side visibility is maintained, considering the presence or absence of rocks in neighboring cells.
Consider the grid as a matrix and iterate over each cell (i, j). For each cell:
  If the cell is empty (.), check if the cells to its right are also empty. 
    If yes, set dp[i][j] = 1, indicating that the mirror can be placed at this position.
    If not, set dp[i][j] = 0, as the visibility would be blocked.

For each cell:
  If the cell contains a rock (#), set dp[i][j] = 0, as the presence of a rock blocks visibility.

Utilize memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a cache and reusing them when possible.
