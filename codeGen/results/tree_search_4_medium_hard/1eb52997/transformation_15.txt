===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.

The state expression is dp[row][col], where row and col are integers representing the coordinates of a cell. The base case is when there is no rock in the cell; we recursively check for rocks to the right.
dp[row][col] is True if the cell is empty or the rightmost rock has been reached; otherwise, check the states of the cells to the right.

Correctly initialize a list of lists with False values for all cells. Then, update the states based on the visibility pattern:
for row in range(N):
    for col in range(N):
        if grid[row][col] == '.':
            dp[row][col] = True
        elif grid[row][col] == '#':
            dp[row][col] = False

Update the dynamic programming table by iterating over each cell, considering its East side visibility:
for row in range(N-1, -1, -1):
    for col in range(N-1, -1, -1):
        if grid[row][col] == '.' and (col == N-1 or grid[row][col+1] == '#'):
            dp[row][col] = True
        elif grid[row][col] == '#':
            dp[row][col] = False
