===BEGIN PLAN===
A top-down approach using memoization could be implemented by defining a function that takes the current cell and direction (East) as inputs. The base case would be when the current cell is at the edge of the grid or has no visible rocks to its East.

State relationships can be defined as the number of empty cells to the East with no rocks blocking the line of sight.

Define the state as dp[(i, j)], which stores whether a mirror can be placed at position (i, j) and see all the way to the right without any rocks blocking the line of sight. The base case is when i or j reaches N - 1, meaning we've reached the edge of the grid.

Consider a state where dp[(i, j)] = 1 if there are no rocks to the East at cell (i, j) and all cells to the East have a mirror that can be placed without any rocks blocking the line of sight. If the current cell is empty, then dp[(i, j)] = dp[(i - 1, j)] since we don't need to look up or down.

Use memoization with a dictionary to store the results of subproblems as you solve them, reducing computation time by avoiding redundant calculations.

To improve the plan, consider adding edge cases for when N is less than 2, as there are no more empty cells. Also, ensure that the base case correctly handles all possible scenarios, such as the first row or column having only rocks.
