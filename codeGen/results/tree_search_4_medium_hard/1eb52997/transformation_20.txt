===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.

dp[i][j] represents whether the mirror can be placed at cell (i, j) such that the East side visibility is maintained, considering the presence or absence of rocks in neighboring cells.

Keeping track of the number of consecutive rock-free cells as a state: The transition relationship can be formulated as 
dp[i][j] = 1 if the cell at (i, j) is empty and there are rocks in none of the previous cells to its right,
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] if the cell at (i, j) is empty and there are rocks in some of the previous cells to its right,
else 0. This choice ensures that the mirror can only be placed where the East side visibility is maintained.

Use memoization with a function that takes the current cell state as input

For each cell in the grid, check if it's empty or not, and for each non-empty cell, update dp[i][j] based on the previous row.
Calculate the total count of valid cells by summing up dp[N-1][j] over all j.
