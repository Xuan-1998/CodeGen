===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.

dp[i][j] represents whether the mirror can be placed at cell (i, j) such that the East side visibility is maintained, considering the presence or absence of rocks in neighboring cells.
Maintaining a count of rock-free cells to the left as a state: The transition relationship can be formulated as dp[i][j] = 1 if the cell at (i, j) is empty and there are no rocks in any previous cells to its left, else dp[i-1][j]. This choice ensures that the mirror can only be placed where the East side visibility is maintained.

Apply a bottom-up approach using iteration instead of recursion to compute dp[i][j], as it's more efficient for larger grids. Initialize dp[0][j] = 1 if cell (0, j) is empty and no rocks are present on its left side.
For each row i from 1 to N-1:
    For each column j from 0 to N-1:
        If cell (i, j) is empty and there are no rocks in any previous cells to its left:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
        else:
            dp[i][j] = 0
Return the sum of all values in the last row of the dp array as the total number of possible options.
