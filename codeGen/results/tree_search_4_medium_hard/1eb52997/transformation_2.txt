===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.

The state expression is dp[i][j], where i represents the row number (0-indexed) and j represents the column number (0-indexed). The value of dp[i][j] is 1 if the cell at position (i, j) can see an empty cell to its East, and 0 otherwise.

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] if grid[i][j] == '.' and not any(grid[k][j] == '#' for k in range(i+1, N))

Correct the plan by handling edge cases:
    - For the top row (i=0), set dp[0][j] to 1 if the cell is empty.
    - For the first column (j=0), set dp[i][0] to 1 if the cell is empty.

Use a nested list comprehension with recursion to optimize computation.
