===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify overlapping subproblems: The number of possible options to place a mirror at 45 degrees can be computed by iterating over each cell in the grid, considering its East side visibility. Overlapping subproblems arise when multiple cells have the same East side visibility pattern. Optimize with dynamic programming.

The state expression is dp[row][col], where row and col are integers representing the coordinates of a cell. The base case is when there is no rock in the cell, and we recursively check for rocks to the right.

dp[row][col] represents whether it's possible to place a mirror at this position such that there are no rocks on its line of sight.
Check for edge cases: 
1. N=1: No rocks can be placed
2. N=0: No mirror can be placed

Implement memoization by using a dictionary to store the intermediate results and update the dictionary as you recurse through the cells.

For each cell, check if there's rock present or not. If no rock is present, it means we can place a mirror at that position.
If rock is present, then recursively call for the right side cells until we find the first rock. This will give us the maximum number of possible positions where a mirror can be placed.
