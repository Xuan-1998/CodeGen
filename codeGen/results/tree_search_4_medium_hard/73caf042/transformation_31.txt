===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with memoization. Here's an updated version of our plan:

Let dp[i][j] be the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column.

Base case: when i or j equals 1, there is only one room, so dp[1][1] = |even digits - odd digits| (where |x| represents the absolute value of x).

Transition: dp[i][j] depends on the following:

- dp[i-1][j-1]: the number of diamonds in the (i-1)-th row and (j-1)-th column
- dp[i-1][j]: the number of diamonds in the (i-1)-th row and j-th column
- dp[i][j-1]: the number of diamonds in the i-th row and (j-1)-th column

We can calculate dp[i][j] using these values: dp[i][j] = |even digits - odd digits| + dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]

To avoid redundant calculations, we can use memoization to store the values of dp[i][j] for smaller values of i and j.

The total number of diamonds in the grid is then dp[N][N].
