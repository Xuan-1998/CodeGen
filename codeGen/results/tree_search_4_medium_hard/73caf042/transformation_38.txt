===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a function dp(i, j) that returns the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column depends on the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number, as well as the total number of diamonds in the (i-1)-th row and (j-1)-th column.

dp(i, j) = |sum of even digits in (i + j - 1) for 1 ≤ i ≤ N, 1 ≤ j ≤ N;

The state could be the current row and column indices (i, j), and the transition relationship is that the total number of diamonds in a room depends on the sum of even digits and odd digits in its room number, as well as the total number of diamonds in the previous room.

We can use memoization to store the values of dp(i, j) for smaller values of i and j. To avoid redundant calculations, we can fill the memo array in bottom-up manner, starting from dp(1, 1).

The base case would be when i or j is equal to 1, in which case dp(i, j) = 0.

To calculate dp(i, j), we need to calculate the sum of even digits and odd digits in (i + j - 1). We can use a helper function to do this. Then, we add or subtract this value from dp((i-1), (j-1)) based on whether the current room number has more even or odd digits.

The final result would be dp(N, N).
