===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns depends on the total number of diamonds in the first (i-1)th row and the first (j-1)th column, as well as the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number.

We can use tabulation to fill up the dp array from top to bottom and left to right. Specifically:

dp[0][j] = 0 for all j
dp[i][0] = 0 for all i

For i > 0 and j > 0, calculate dp[i][j] as follows:
- Calculate sum_even and sum_odd representing the sum of even digits and odd digits in room number (i, j)
- Calculate the absolute difference between sum_even and sum_odd
- Add this to the total diamonds in the top-left (i-1)th row and (j-1)th column

This way, we avoid redundant calculations by only considering the current room and its previous rows.

Finally, after filling up the dp array, return dp[N][N] as the total number of diamonds in the entire grid.
