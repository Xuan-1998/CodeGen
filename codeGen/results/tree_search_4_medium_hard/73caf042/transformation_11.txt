===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns.

We can start by initializing the base case: dp[0][j] is 0 for all j, because there are no rooms to count diamonds in. Then, we fill up the dp array from top to bottom and left to right.

For each cell dp[i][j], we calculate its value as the sum of absolute differences between sums of even digits and odd digits in room numbers (1, 1) to (i, j). This is done by iterating over all room numbers in this range and calculating the difference for each one. We add these differences up to get dp[i][j].

Finally, we return the value at the bottom-right corner of the dp array as the total number of diamonds.
