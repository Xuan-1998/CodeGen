===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns depends on the total number of diamonds in the first (i-1)th row and the first (j-1)th column, as well as the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number.

We can use tabulation to fill up the dp array from top to bottom and left to right. Initialize a dictionary memo to store intermediate results.

dp[i][j] = |sum of even digits in (i, j) - sum of odd digits in (i, j)| + dp[i-1][j] if i > 0
       else if j > 0:
          dp[i][j] = |sum of even digits in (i, j) - sum of odd digits in (i, j)| + dp[i][j-1]
       else:
          dp[i][j] = |sum of even digits in (i, j) - sum of odd digits in (i, j)|

We need to calculate the sum of even and odd digits for each room number. This can be done by converting the room number into a string, iterating over each character, checking if it's even or odd, and adding it to the respective sum.

Finally, return dp[N][N] as the total number of diamonds in the grid.
