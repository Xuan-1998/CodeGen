===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a function f(i, j) that returns the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column depends on the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number, as well as the total number of diamonds in the (i-1)-th row and (j-1)-th column.

We can use memoization to store the values of f(i, j) for smaller values of i and j. Let f(i, j) be the number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column. The base case is when i or j equals 1.

state: f(i, j) = |even_sum - odd_sum| where even_sum is the sum of even digits in the i-th row and j-th column, and odd_sum is the sum of odd digits in the same.

Use a dictionary to store the values of f(i, j) as you compute them. The memoized function will be:

f(i, j) = |even_sum - odd_sum| + memo[(i-1), (j-1)] if i > 1 and j > 1
else: f(i, j) = |even_sum - odd_sum|

To find the total number of diamonds in the grid, we just need to call the function with the correct arguments for each room.
