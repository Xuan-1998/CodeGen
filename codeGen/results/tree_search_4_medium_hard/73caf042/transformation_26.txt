===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can define a function dp[i][j] that represents the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column. The base case is when i or j is 0, in which case the total number of diamonds is 0.
dp[0][j] = 0 for all j; 
dp[i][0] = 0 for all i;
The recursive formula is:
f(i, j) = |sum of even digits in (i + j - 1) - sum of odd digits in (i + j - 1)| + f(i-1, j-1);
This function calculates the total number of diamonds in the current room and adds it to the total number of diamonds in the top-left sub-grid.
We can use memoization to store the values of dp[i][j] for smaller values of i and j. This way, we avoid recalculating the same values multiple times and improve the time complexity.
The final answer is the value of dp[N-1][N-1].
