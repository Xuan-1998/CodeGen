===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns.

The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns depends on the total number of diamonds in the first (i-1)th row and the first (j-1)th column, as well as the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number.

We can use tabulation to fill up the dp array from top to bottom and left to right. Initialize a 2D array dp of size N x N with all zeros, where N is the grid size.

Define dp[i][j] as the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns, considering only the rooms that have been visited so far.

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + |room_number(i,j)| - |room_number(i-1,j)|. This state captures the dynamic programming relationship between adjacent rooms.

To fill up the dp array, for each cell (i,j), we calculate the total number of diamonds by considering only the rooms that have been visited so far.

For the first row and column, set dp[0][j] = 0 and dp[i][0] = 0 for all i. This represents the base case where there are no previous rows or columns to consider.

Then, fill up the dp array from top to bottom and left to right using the dynamic programming relationship defined earlier.

Finally, calculate the total number of diamonds in the entire grid by summing up all values in the dp array: total_diamonds = ΣΣ dp[i][j] for 0 <= i < N and 0 <= j < N.
