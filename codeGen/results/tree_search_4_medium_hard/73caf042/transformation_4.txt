===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns depends on the total number of diamonds in the first (i-1)th row and the first (j-1)th column, as well as the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number. We can use tabulation to fill up the dp array from top to bottom and left to right.

dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns, considering only the rooms that have been visited so far.

Define dp[i][j] as the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns, where dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + |room_number(i,j)| - |room_number(i-1,j)|. This state captures the dynamic programming relationship between adjacent rooms.

We can also use memoization by defining a function that takes as input the current room number and returns the total number of diamonds in that room, using the same dynamic programming relationship.

For each test case, iterate through all rows and columns, calculate the room number and update dp[i][j] accordingly. The final answer is the sum of all dp[i][j].

The plan includes edge cases, as it handles the first row and column separately.
