===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a function f(i, j) that returns the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column depends on the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number, as well as the total number of diamonds in the (i-1)-th row and (j-1)-th column.

We can use memoization to store the values of f(i, j) for smaller values of i and j. The dynamic programming function dp[i][j] will be the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns.

Then, for 1 ≤ i ≤ N and 1 ≤ j ≤ N, we have that dp[i][j] = |sum of even digits in (i + j - 1) - sum of odd digits in (i + j - 1)| + dp[i-1][j-1].

We can initialize the base case dp[0][0] to be 0, since there are no diamonds in a grid with 0 rows and 0 columns.

To fill up the dp table, we start from the base case dp[0][0], then recursively calculate dp[i][j] for larger values of i and j. The memoization will store the calculated values to avoid redundant calculations.

Finally, the total number of diamonds in the N × N grid is given by the value at the bottom-right corner of the dp table, which is dp[N][N].
