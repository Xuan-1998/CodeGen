===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a function f(i, j) that returns the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column depends on the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number, as well as the total number of diamonds in the (i-1)-th row and (j-1)-th column.

Let f(i, j) be the number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column. The base case is when i or j equals 1.
state: f(i, j) = |even_sum - odd_sum| where even_sum and odd_sum are the sum of even digits and odd digits respectively in the i-th row and j-th column.

Create a dictionary memo to store the values of f(i, j) for smaller values of i and j. We can use this memoization technique because there are overlapping subproblems that can be solved efficiently by storing their results.

Finally, we iterate over all rooms in the grid (N x N) and calculate the number of diamonds using the memoized function f(i, j). The total number of diamonds is simply the sum of these values for each room.
