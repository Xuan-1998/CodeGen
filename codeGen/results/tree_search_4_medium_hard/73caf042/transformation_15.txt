===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns depends on the total number of diamonds in the first (i-1)th row and the first (j-1)th column, as well as the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number. We can use tabulation to fill up the dp array from top to bottom and left to right.

The state dp[i][j] depends on the states dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1], as well as the number of diamonds in the current room. The formula for dp[i][j] can be written as:

dp[i][j] = |(sum of even digits in (i, j)) - (sum of odd digits in (i, j))|

where (i, j) is the room number at row i and column j.

We iterate from i=1 to N and j=1 to N. For each cell dp[i][j], we calculate the absolute difference between the sum of even digits and sum of odd digits in its room number.

Finally, we can print out the total number of diamonds in the grid as the sum of all values in the dp array.
