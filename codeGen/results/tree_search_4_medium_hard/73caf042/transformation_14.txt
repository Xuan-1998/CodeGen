===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns depends on the total number of diamonds in the first (i-1)th row and the first (j-1)th column, as well as the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number.

We can use tabulation to fill up the dp array from top to bottom and left to right. The base case is when i or j is 1, where there are no rooms above or to the left, so the total number of diamonds is 0.

For each cell dp[i][j], we calculate the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number, then add it to the sum of diamonds from the top-left cell (dp[i-1][j-1]) and subtract the sum of diamonds from the top cell (dp[i-1][j]), or the left cell (dp[i][j-1]) if there are no cells above.

Finally, we return the total number of diamonds in the bottom-right cell dp[N][N].
