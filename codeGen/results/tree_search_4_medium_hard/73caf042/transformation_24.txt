===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a function f(i, j) that returns the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column depends on the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number, as well as the total number of diamonds in the (i-1)-th row and (j-1)-th column. We can use memoization to store the values of f(i, j) for smaller values of i and j.

f(i, j) = |sum of even digits in (i + j - 1) - sum of odd digits in (i + j - 1)| for 1 ≤ i ≤ N, 1 ≤ j ≤ N;

Consider the total number of diamonds in a sub-grid of size (i+1) × (j+1). It is equal to the total number of diamonds in the current row and column plus the total number of diamonds in the top-left (i-1) × (j-1) sub-grid.

This recursive relationship can be used to formulate the state transition. You can implement tabulation by initializing a 2D array dp of size N x N, where dp[i][j] stores the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column.

To compute dp[i][j], you need to consider the room number (i + j - 1). Calculate the sum of even digits and odd digits in this room number, then use these values to calculate the total number of diamonds in the current cell. This is done by calling f(i-1, j-1) and adding the result.

The final answer will be dp[N][N].
