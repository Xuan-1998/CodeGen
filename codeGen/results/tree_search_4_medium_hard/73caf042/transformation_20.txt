===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns depends on the total number of diamonds in the first (i-1)th row and the first (j-1)th column, as well as the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number. We can use tabulation to fill up the dp array from top to bottom and left to right.

Let dp[i][j] be the minimum number of diamonds needed to fill up the first i rows and the first j columns. Then, for the base case, dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 0 for all i and j.

dp[i][j] is a function of the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number (i, j). So, dp[i][j] = |sum(digit(i, j)) - sum(other_digit(i, j))|

Let total_diamonds be the total number of diamonds. Initialize it to 0.

For i from 1 to N:
    For j from 1 to N:
        Calculate the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number (i, j).
        Update total_diamonds based on the calculation.
    End
End

Return total_diamonds.
