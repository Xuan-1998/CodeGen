===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns depends on the total number of diamonds in the first (i-1)th row and the first (j-1)th column, as well as the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number.

To fill up the dp array from top to bottom and left to right, we can use a nested loop. The base cases are at the boundaries, where i or j is 0.

dp[i][j] is calculated using the following steps:

1. Calculate the sum of even digits (se) and sum of odd digits (so) in the current room number (i * (i + 1) / 2 + j + 1).
2. Calculate the absolute difference between se and so.
3. Add this value to the top-left diagonal cell dp[i-1][j-1] if it exists, or initialize with 0 if not.

The final answer is stored in dp[N-1][N-1].
