===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use dynamic programming with memoization.

We define a 2D array dp[N][N] where dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and j columns. The base case is when i or j equals to 1, in which case there are no rooms above or to the left, so the total number of diamonds is equal to |sum of even digits in (i + j - 1) - sum of odd digits in (i + j - 1)|.

The recursive formula is:

dp[i][j] = |sum of even digits in (i + j - 1) - sum of odd digits in (i + j - 1)| + dp[i-1][j]

We fill up the dp array row by row, from top to bottom. For each cell, we only need the values of cells above it and to its left. We store these values in a temporary array temp[N] before updating the current cell.

Finally, we calculate the total number of diamonds as the sum of all cells in the last row.
