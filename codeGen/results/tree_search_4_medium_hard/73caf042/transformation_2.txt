===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns.

The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns depends on the total number of diamonds in the first (i-1)th row and the first (j-1)th column, as well as the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number.

We can use tabulation to fill up the dp array from top to bottom and left to right. Define dp[i][j] as the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns, where:

dp[i][j] = |sum of even digits in room numbers| - |sum of odd digits in room numbers|

This state captures the cumulative effect of visiting rooms with increasing row and column indices.

To implement both tabulation and memoization, use a 2D array dp to store the cumulative sum of even and odd digits for each room, then iterate through the grid from top to bottom and left to right, updating each cell based on its dependence on the previous cells.

Finally, return dp[N][N] as the total number of diamonds in the entire grid.
