===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can define a function f(i, j) that returns the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column. We can use memoization to store the values of f(i, j) for smaller values of i and j.

f(i, j) = |sum of even digits in (i + j - 1)|
We will create a dictionary memo to store the values of f(i, j).

To initialize the memo, we set f(0, 0) = 0. This is because there are no rooms in the 0-th row and 0-th column.

For the base case, when i or j equals N, we return 0. This is because there are no more rooms to calculate.

Now, let's define the recursive function f(i, j). We can use the following transition relationship:
f(i, j) = |sum of even digits in (i + j - 1)| + f(i-1, j-1)

This means that the total number of diamonds in a room depends on the sum of even digits and odd digits in its room number, as well as the total number of diamonds in the previous room.

Finally, we calculate the total number of diamonds by iterating from i = 1 to N and j = 1 to N, and add up f(i, j).

This plan takes care of edge cases. For example, when i or j equals 0, there are no more rooms to calculate.
