===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a function f(i, j) that returns the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column depends on the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number, as well as the total number of diamonds in the (i-1)-th row and (j-1)-th column.

Let f(i, j) be the number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column. The base case is when i or j equals 1.
state: f(i, j) = |even_sum - odd_sum| where even_sum is the sum of even digits in the i-th row and j-th column, and odd_sum is the sum of odd digits in the same.

Create a 2D table dp to store the number of diamonds in each cell

For each cell (i, j), calculate even_sum and odd_sum
even_sum = sum of even digits in room(i, j)
odd_sum = sum of odd digits in room(i, j)

f(i, j) = |even_sum - odd_sum|

dp[i][j] = f(i, j)

for i from 1 to N:
    for j from 1 to N:
        dp[i][j] = f(i, j)
        
return sum of all values in dp table
