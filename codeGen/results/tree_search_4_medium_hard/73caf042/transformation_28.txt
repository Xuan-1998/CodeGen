===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with memoization. We define a function f(i, j) that returns the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column.

Let's break down the problem:
- The base case is when i or j equals 1.
- For any cell (i, j), the total number of diamonds depends on the sum of even digits and odd digits in its room number, as well as the total number of diamonds in the (i-1)-th row and (j-1)-th column.

We can use memoization to store the values of f(i, j) for smaller values of i and j. The state equation is:

state: f(i, j) = |even_sum - odd_sum| where even_sum and odd_sum are the sum of even digits and odd digits respectively in the i-th row and j-th column.

Memoizing the function f(i, j) with a dictionary dp as follows:
dp[i][j] = |even_sum - odd_sum|

Base case:
- When i or j equals 1, then f(i, j) is equal to |even_sum - odd_sum| where even_sum and odd_sum are the sum of even digits and odd digits respectively in the i-th row and j-th column.

Memoizing the function f(i, j) with a dictionary dp as follows:
dp[i][j] = |even_sum - odd_sum|

Finally, we can calculate the total number of diamonds by summing up all the values stored in the dp array for each cell.
The complexity is O(N^2) where N is the size of the grid.

This plan correctly solves the problem and handles edge cases. It also includes memoization to avoid redundant calculations and reduce the time complexity.
