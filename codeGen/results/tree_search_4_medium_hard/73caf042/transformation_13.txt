To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns depends on the total number of diamonds in the first (i-1)th row and the first (j-1)th column, as well as the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number.

We can use tabulation to fill up the dp array from top to bottom and left to right. To calculate dp[i][j], we need to know the total number of diamonds in the previous room (i-1, j) and the sum of even and odd digits in the current room number. We can store these values in a dictionary with the key being the room number and the value being the total number of diamonds.

dp[i][j] is calculated as follows:

* If it's the first row or column (i.e., i or j is 1), then dp[i][j] is calculated directly based on the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number.
* Otherwise, dp[i][j] is the sum of the absolute differences between the sums of even digits and odd digits in all room numbers from (1, 1) to (i-1, j-1), plus the sum of the absolute difference between the sums of even digits and odd digits in the current room number.

To calculate the total number of diamonds, we simply need to sum up dp[i][j] for all i and j. This can be done by using another 2D array to store the cumulative values.
