===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns. We use tabulation to fill up the dp array from top to bottom and left to right.

Initially, set dp[0][j] = 0 for all j (1-indexed) because there are no rooms to consider when we start from row 0. Similarly, set dp[i][0] = 0 for all i (1-indexed).

For each cell in the dp array, calculate the total number of diamonds considering only the rooms that have been visited so far.

Define dp[i][j] as the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns, where:
dp[i][j] = |sum of even digits in room numbers| - |sum of odd digits in room numbers|

This state captures the cumulative effect of visiting rooms with increasing row and column indices.

To calculate dp[i][j], use the following recursive formula:

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + (|even_sum(i, j)| - |odd_sum(i, j)|)

where even_sum(i, j) is the sum of even digits in room number i+j, and odd_sum(i, j) is the sum of odd digits in room number i+j.

Finally, return dp[N][N] as the total number of diamonds in the grid, where N is the size of the grid.
