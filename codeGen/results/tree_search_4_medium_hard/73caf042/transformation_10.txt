===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns.

dp[0][j] = 0 for all j because there are no rooms above row 1.
dp[i][0] = 0 for all i because there are no columns to the left of column 1.

For dp[i][j], calculate the sum of even digits and odd digits in room number (i, j). The absolute difference between these two sums is the number of diamonds in that room. Add this value to dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1]. This is because the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns depends on the total number of diamonds in the first (i-1)th row and the first (j-1)th column, as well as the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number.

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1] - |(sum of even digits in room number (i, j)) - (sum of odd digits in room number (i, j))|

Memoize this function to avoid redundant calculations. This way, we can calculate the total number of diamonds for each subproblem only once.
