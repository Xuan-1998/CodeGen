===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a function f(i, j) that returns the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column depends on the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number, as well as the total number of diamonds in the (i-1)-th row and (j-1)-th column.

We can use memoization to store the values of f(i, j) for smaller values of i and j. The state transition is that the total number of diamonds in a sub-grid of size (i+1) × (j+1) is equal to the total number of diamonds in the current row and column plus the total number of diamonds in the top-left (i-1) × (j-1) sub-grid.

The initial state is when i = 1, j = 1, where the function f(1, 1) returns the sum of even digits and odd digits in room (1, 1). The base case is when i or j exceeds N.

To calculate f(i, j), we can iterate over all rooms from (i, j-1) to (N, N), and for each room, calculate the number of diamonds using the sum of even digits and odd digits in its room number. We then add this value to the memoization array and store it.

Finally, we initialize a 2D array dp of size N × N with all elements set to 0. Then, we iterate over all rooms from (1, 1) to (N, N), and for each room, calculate f(i, j) using the stored values in the memoization array. We add this value to dp[i][j] and store it.

The total number of diamonds is then calculated by summing up all elements in the dp array.
