===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a function f(i, j) that returns the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column depends on the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number, as well as the total number of diamonds in the (i-1)-th row and (j-1)-th column.

We can use memoization to store the values of f(i, j) for smaller values of i and j. Let f(i, j) be the number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column. The base case is when i or j equals 1.

The transition: f(i, j) depends on f(i-1, j), f(i, j-1), and f(i-1, j-1).

Define a 2D array dp of size (N+1) x (N+1) to store the total number of diamonds in each room. Initialize all values in dp to 0.

For i from 2 to N:
    For j from 2 to N:
        Calculate the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number.
        Calculate f(i, j) based on the calculated sum and the values stored in dp at (i-1, j), (i, j-1), and (i-1, j-1).
        Store the value of f(i, j) in dp[i][j].

Finally, return the value stored in dp[N][N] as the total number of diamonds in the grid.
