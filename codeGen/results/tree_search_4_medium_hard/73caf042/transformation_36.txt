===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a function f(i, j) that returns the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column depends on the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number, as well as the total number of diamonds in the (i-1)-th row and (j-1)-th column.

We can use memoization to store the values of f(i, j) for smaller values of i and j. The state could be the current row and column indices (i, j), and the transition relationship is that the total number of diamonds in a room depends on the sum of even digits and odd digits in its room number, as well as the total number of diamonds in the previous room.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. To implement tabulation, you could create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the i-th row and j-th column.

For each cell dp[i][j], we calculate the sum of even digits and odd digits in its room number (i+j-1), then add the absolute difference between these two sums to the total number of diamonds in the previous cell (dp[(i-1)][(j-1)]). This ensures that we don't count duplicate diamonds.

The base case is when i or j reaches 0, at which point the function returns 0 because there are no more rooms to consider. The final answer would be dp[N][N].
