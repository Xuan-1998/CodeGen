===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns depends on the total number of diamonds in the first (i-1)th row and the first (j-1)th column, as well as the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number. We can use tabulation to fill up the dp array from top to bottom and left to right.

dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns, considering only the rooms that have been visited so far.

Define transition relationships based on whether the current room's row and column indices are even or odd. 

For even-rowed rooms: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + |even_sum - odd_sum| 
For odd-rowed rooms: dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + |even_sum - odd_sum| 

To use a recursive function with memoization to store the intermediate results

dp[0][0] = 0, for all i, j
dp[i][0] = 0, for all i
dp[0][j] = 0, for all j
