To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns depends on the total number of diamonds in the first (i-1)th row and the first (j-1)th column, as well as the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number.

We can use tabulation to fill up the dp array from top to bottom and left to right. Define dp[i][j] as the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns, where dp[i][j] = |sum of even digits in room numbers| - |sum of odd digits in room numbers|. This state captures the cumulative effect of visiting rooms with increasing row and column indices.

To implement tabulation, consider initializing a 2D array dp where dp[0][0] = 0. Fill up the dp array from top to bottom and left to right, updating each cell based on its dependence on the previous cells. For example, dp[i][j] can be calculated as the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns, considering only the rooms that have been visited so far.

The base case is when i = 1 or j = 1, where there is only one room visited so far, and the sum of even digits and odd digits can be calculated directly. The recursive case is when i > 1 and j > 1, where the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns depends on the previous cells.

Finally, to calculate the total number of diamonds present in the grid for each test case, iterate through all cells in the dp array and add up their values. The time complexity is O(N^2) and the space complexity is also O(N^2), where N is the size of the grid.
