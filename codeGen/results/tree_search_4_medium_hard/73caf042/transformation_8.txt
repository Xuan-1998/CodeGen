===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns depends on the total number of diamonds in the first (i-1)th row and the first (j-1)th column, as well as the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number. We can use tabulation to fill up the dp array from top to bottom and left to right.

dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns, considering only the rooms that have been visited so far.

Define dp[0][j] as a 1D array where dp[0][j] = 0 for all j. Then, define transition relationships based on whether the current room's row index is even or odd:

* If i is even, then dp[i][j] = dp[i/2][j-1] + |even_sum - odd_sum|
* If i is odd, then dp[i][j] = dp[(i+1)/2][j-1]

To convert the problem into a 1D dynamic programming problem and solve it using a single loop:

Let's calculate the total number of diamonds in the first N rows. For each row i from 0 to N-1, we can update the total number of diamonds as follows:

* If i is even, then total_diamonds = total_diamonds + dp[i/2][N-1] + |even_sum - odd_sum|
* If i is odd, then total_diamonds = total_diamonds + dp[(i+1)/2][N-1]

Finally, return the calculated total number of diamonds.
