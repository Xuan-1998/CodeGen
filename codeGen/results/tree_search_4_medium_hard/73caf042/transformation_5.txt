===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify overlapping subproblems, we can define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns. The optimal substructure is that the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns depends on the total number of diamonds in the first (i-1)th row and the first (j-1)th column, as well as the sum of even digits and odd digits in the current room number.

We can use tabulation to fill up the dp array from top to bottom and left to right. Define dp[i][j] as the total number of diamonds in the first i rows and the first j columns, considering only the rooms that have been visited so far:

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + |room_number(i,j)| - |room_number(i-1,j)|
This state captures the dynamic programming relationship between adjacent rooms.

Another option is to implement tabulation with memoization by combining both approaches, where we first calculate the total number of diamonds for each row and then update the dp array accordingly:

dp[i][j] = sum(room_number(k,l) | k=1..i, l=1..j)
    - sum(|room_number(k-1,l)| | k=2..i, l=1..j)

We can initialize dp[0][0] to 0 and fill up the dp array accordingly. For edge cases where i or j is less than 1, we set dp[i][j] = 0.

Finally, for each test case, we return sum(sum(dp[i][j] | i=1..N, j=1..N)) as the total number of diamonds present in the grid.
