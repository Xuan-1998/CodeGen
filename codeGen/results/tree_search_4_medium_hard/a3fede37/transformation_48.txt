===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, taking into account its children.

Define two states: 
dp[i] is the maximum sum of a path ending at the ith node. 
parent[i] is the parent node of the ith node (or -1 if it's the root).

The state transition is:
dp[i] = max(dp[2*i+1], dp[2*i+2]) + tree[i]
parent[i] = 2*(i//2)

Start from the leaf nodes and work your way up to the root. 
For each node, calculate its maximum sum of a path using the transition relation.

The base case is when i is less than or equal to 1 (i.e., it's a leaf node). In this case, dp[i] = tree[i].
