===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, taking into account its children and grandchildren.

The state expression is dp[i] = max(dp[2*i+1], dp[2*i+2]) + tree[i], where tree[i] is the value of the ith node in the binary tree and 0-indexing is used. This base case considers that each node can be either the start or end of a path.

Define a state s[i] as the maximum sum of a path starting from the ith node. The transition relation is s[i] = max(s[2*i+1], s[2*i+2]) + tree[i]. 

Apply dynamic programming by defining a bottom-up approach with a 2D array dp to store the maximum sum of paths starting from each node, initializing the first row as the root node's value and then iteratively calculate the maximum sum of paths for each node.

For each leaf node, initialize its state to its own value. For non-leaf nodes, recursively calculate their states by considering the maximum sum of paths ending at their left child, right child, or both, and add the value of the current node to it.

Finally, return the maximum value in the last row of the dp array as the maximum sum of a path in the given binary tree.
