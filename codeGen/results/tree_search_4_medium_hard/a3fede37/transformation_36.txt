===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, taking into account its children.

Let dp[i] = max_sum_of_path_ending_at_node_i be the state expression, which represents the maximum sum of a path ending at node i.
View each node's maximum sum of a path ending at it as the maximum of:
    - Its own value
    - The value of its left child
    - The value of its right child
    - And the sums of paths ending at its children, recursively calculated for all child nodes

Use a separate array to store the maximum sum of a path ending at each node.

The base case is when the input array only contains one node, in which case dp[i] = arr[i].

To fill up the dp array:
    1. Iterate through the array from left to right.
    2. For each node i, calculate its max_sum_of_path_ending_at_node_i as the maximum of:
        - Its own value
        - The value of its left child
        - The value of its right child
        - And the sums of paths ending at its children

The final answer is the maximum sum stored in the dp array.
