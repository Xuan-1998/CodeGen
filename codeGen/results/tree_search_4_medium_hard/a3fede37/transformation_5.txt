===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a recursive function that calculates the maximum sum of a path in the tree, where each function call represents a subproblem, and use memoization to store the results of these subproblems.

Define the state as the node value and the maximum path sum including this node, considering both left and right subtrees. This allows for more flexibility in exploring different paths.

Consider using dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach: start by calculating the maximum sum of each leaf node, then recursively calculate the maximum sum of each internal node based on its children's maximum sums.

Utilize a dictionary to store the memoized results for each node, and use it to avoid redundant calculations. This is crucial because calculating the maximum sum of a path can involve multiple recursive calls.

Recursively traverse the tree in a depth-first manner (using either DFS or BFS), keeping track of the current node's value and the maximum sum of its left and right subtrees.

For each node, calculate the maximum sum by considering two options: including this node in the path and excluding it. If the node's value is greater than the sum of its children's values, include it; otherwise, exclude it.

Store the calculated maximum sum for each node in the dictionary for future reference.

Once the traversal is complete, return the maximum sum stored in the dictionary for the root node as the solution.
