===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree using tabulation, and identify the optimal solution.

The state expression is dp[i][j], representing the maximum sum of a path from node i to node j, including all nodes on that path.
Consider each node's maximum sum as its value in the dynamic programming table.

Implement memoization by storing the maximum sum of each node's subtree in a dictionary.
Iterate through the array representation of the binary tree, considering each node and its children. 
For each node:
    Calculate the maximum sum including itself using its left and right child's values (if they exist).
    Update the memoization table with the calculated value.
Calculate the maximum sum of all paths starting from any node by iterating through the memoization table.
