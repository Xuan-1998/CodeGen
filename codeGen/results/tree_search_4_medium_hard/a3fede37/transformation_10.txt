===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree using tabulation, and identify the optimal solution.

The state expression is dp[i], representing the maximum sum of a path ending at node i.

dp[i] is updated as the maximum of:
    1. The value of node i itself
    2. The maximum sum of a path ending at the left child, plus the value of node i
    3. The maximum sum of a path ending at the right child, plus the value of node i

for all nodes in the tree.

Use bottom-up dynamic programming with a 1D array to store the maximum sum of paths ending at each node.

Pre-compute and store the left and right child indices for each node.

To avoid unnecessary computations, only update dp[i] if both left and right children are present.
