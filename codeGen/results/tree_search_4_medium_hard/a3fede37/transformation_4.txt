===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing an array with zeros, where each index represents a node value in the input array. Then, iteratively fill up this array based on the values and recursively calculate the maximum sum of paths including each node.

Define the state as a tuple (val, max_sum), where val is the node value and max_sum is the maximum path sum including this node. This allows for more flexibility in exploring different paths.

Start by initializing the memoization array with zeros. Then, iterate through the input array from left to right, considering each node's value and its corresponding left and right subtrees.

For each node, calculate the maximum path sum including this node by considering both the maximum sum of the left subtree and the maximum sum of the right subtree, along with the node's own value. Use memoization to store the results for subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.

Finally, return the last element in the memoization array as the maximum sum of a path in the given binary tree.
