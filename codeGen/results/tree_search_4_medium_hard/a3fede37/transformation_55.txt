===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, taking into account its children.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j+1]) + tree[i-1], where i represents the current node and j represents its child. However, this expression does not take into account whether the path includes the node itself or only one of its children.

A revised state expression is dp[i] = max(dp[leftChild], dp[rightChild]) + tree[i], where leftChild and rightChild are the indices of the left and right children of the current node. If a child has no left or right child, we set it to -1 so that the maximum sum can be calculated.

The base case is when there are no more children. In this case, the maximum sum is simply the value of the current node.

dp[i] = max(leftChildSum, rightChildSum) + tree[i] for i in range(1, len(tree))

Use memoization to cache and reused calculated values
