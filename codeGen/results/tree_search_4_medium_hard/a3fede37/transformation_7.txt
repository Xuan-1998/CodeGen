===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a recursive function that calculates the maximum sum of a path in the tree, and use memoization to store the results of subproblems.

Define the state as the node value, the left subtree's maximum path sum including this node, and the right subtree's maximum path sum including this node. This allows for more flexibility in exploring different paths.

The state is the node value, and the transition relationship is the maximum between the current node's value and the sums of its left and right subtrees. If a node has no children, its maximum path sum is just its own value.

Use a list of lists to store the memoized values, where each inner list represents a subtree and its corresponding maximum path sum.

Calculate the maximum path sum for each node by considering both its left and right subtrees. Start from the root node and recursively explore the tree, updating the memoization table as you go.

After exploring the entire tree, the maximum path sum is stored in the memoization table at the root node's position. Return this value as the final result.
