===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a recursive function that calculates the maximum sum of a path in the tree, and use memoization to store the results of subproblems.

Define the state as the node value and the maximum path sum including this node, considering both left and right subtrees. This allows for more flexibility in exploring different paths.

Use a dictionary to store and update the maximum path sums as you recursively explore the tree.

Begin at the root node and recursively calculate the maximum path sum of each subtree.
For each node, consider both the current node's value and the values of its left and right subtrees. This allows for more flexibility in exploring different paths.
When a subproblem is solved (i.e., when you've reached a leaf node), store the result in the dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

To calculate the maximum path sum for a given node, consider both the current node's value and the values of its left and right subtrees. 
This will give you the maximum path sum that includes this node, considering all possible paths through the tree.
When you've reached the root node, return the stored result as the maximum path sum.
