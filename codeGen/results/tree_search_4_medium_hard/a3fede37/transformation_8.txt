===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a recursive function that calculates the maximum sum of a path in the tree, and use memoization to store the results of subproblems.

Define the state as the node value and the maximum path sum including this node, considering both left and right subtrees. This allows for more flexibility in exploring different paths.

The state is the node value, and the transition relationship is the maximum path sum including this node, considering both left and right subtrees.

Implement memoization using recursion with a dictionary to store the cached results.

Consider handling edge cases such as an empty tree (return 0), or a tree with only one node (return the node value).

To improve the plan, consider a bottom-up approach instead of recursive function. This can avoid potential stack overflow issues for large inputs.
