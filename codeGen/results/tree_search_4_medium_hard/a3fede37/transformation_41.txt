===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, taking into account its children.

The state expression is dp[i] = max_sum_of_path_ending_at_node_i, which represents the maximum sum of a path ending at node i.

To determine the maximum sum of a path ending at any node in the tree, consider the node's value and the maximum sums of paths ending at its left and right subtrees. This can be done recursively for each node, considering both its children and its value when calculating the maximum sum of a path ending at it.

Create a memo table with dp[i][j] representing the maximum sum of a path from node i to node j, and iterate over nodes to fill up this table. The base case is when i == j, in which case the maximum sum is simply the value of the node at index i.

The main loop iterates over all possible paths in the tree by considering each node and its left and right subtrees separately. This can be done using a recursive function that takes as input the current node and fills up the memo table with the maximum sums of paths ending at this node and its children.

When calculating the maximum sum for a given node, consider both the value of the node itself and the maximum sums of paths ending at its left and right subtrees. The maximum sum is then the maximum between these two cases.
