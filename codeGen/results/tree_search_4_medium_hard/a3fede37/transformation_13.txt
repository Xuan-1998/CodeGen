===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree using tabulation.

The state expression is dp[i], representing the maximum sum of a path ending at node i. 
dp[i] captures the maximum sum of a path from node i to any leaf node, and update it by adding the value at each step.

Use a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of a path ending at node j in subtree rooted at node i.
For each node i, calculate the maximum sum by considering two options:
    1. The maximum sum without including the current node
    2. The maximum sum including the current node (add its value and recursively consider its left and right subtrees)

Update dp[i] based on these two options, and return the maximum sum found in the entire tree.
