===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree using tabulation and identify the optimal solution.
Define the state as a list of sums for each node in the tree: dp[node] = total sum for node; the base case is when there are no more nodes.
Define the state as a list of node values, dp[node] = maximum sum for each node in the tree.
Determine the maximum sum for each node by recursively visiting all nodes in the tree and updating the maximum sum accordingly.

For each node:
  1. Initialize max_sum as negative infinity.
  2. If the current node is a leaf node (no children), calculate its maximum path sum as its value and update max_sum if necessary.
  3. For each child node, recursively calculate its maximum path sum and add its value to it. Update max_sum if this sum is greater than the previous one.
  4. Return max_sum.

The plan seems correct but might be improved by:
* Using a bottom-up approach instead of recursive function calls.
* Implementing memoization to avoid repeated calculations for each node.
