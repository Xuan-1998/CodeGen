"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given a non-empty binary tree represented as an array, find the maximum sum of a path in the tree. A path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.\\n\\nInput: The input is a non-empty binary tree represented as an array. The input is provided through standard input.\\n\\nOutput: The output is an integer representing the maximum sum of a path in the given binary tree.\\n\\nConstraints: The binary tree can have at most 10^4 nodes and the values of the nodes are between -1000 and 1000.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Tree algorithms', 'Dynamic programming', 'Graph traversal']\", \"difficulties\": \"MEDIUM_HARD\", \"source\": \"leetcode\", \"url\": \"https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/\", \"sample_test_cases\": []}"
