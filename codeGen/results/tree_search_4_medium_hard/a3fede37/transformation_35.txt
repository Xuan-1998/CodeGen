===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, taking into account its children.

state_expression = dp[i] = max_sum_of_path_ending_at_node_i
where state dp[i] represents the maximum sum of a path ending at node i

Consider a tree node as having three states:
1. its value: val[i]
2. the maximum sum of a path ending at its left child: dp[2i+1] 
3. the maximum sum of a path ending at its right child: dp[2i+2]

Develop a recursive approach with memoization, using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems as you solve them.

For each node i:
    1. Calculate dp[i] = val[i] + max(dp[2i+1], dp[2i+2])

Memoize the results for later use

Return the maximum sum of a path ending at the root (0th index)
