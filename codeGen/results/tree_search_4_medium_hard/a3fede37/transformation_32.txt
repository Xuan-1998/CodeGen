===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree using dynamic programming and memoization.

Define the state as a dictionary where the key is the node value and the value is the total sum for that node. 
dp[node] = total sum for node; the base case is when there are no more nodes.
dp[root] = root.value (base case)

The recursive formula is:
dp[node] = max(
    dp[left_child] + left_child.value if left_child else 0, 
    dp[right_child] + right_child.value if right_child else 0,
    node.value
)
Tabulate the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree and keeping track of the optimal solution.

To improve:
- Initialize memoization table with base case values (root node).
- Optimize recursion by pruning branches when the current sum is less than the previously computed maximum.
- Handle edge cases where left or right children are None (no child).

This plan should correctly find the maximum sum of a path in the binary tree. It also includes handling edge cases like nodes without children.
