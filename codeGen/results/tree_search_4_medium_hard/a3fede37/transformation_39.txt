===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, taking into account its children.

The state expression is dp[i] = max_sum_of_path_ending_at_node_i, which represents the maximum sum of a path ending at node i.

To determine the maximum sum of a path ending at any node in the tree, consider the node's value and the maximum sums of paths ending at its left and right subtrees.

Use a bottom-up approach to fill up a dp array where dp[i] represents the maximum sum of a path ending at node i. For each node i:

1. Calculate the maximum sum of a path ending at node i: 
   - Consider the node's value as part of the path sum.
   - Recursively consider the maximum sums of paths ending at its left and right subtrees.

2. Update dp[i] with the maximum sum calculated in step 1.

3. Traverse the tree from the leaves to the root, filling up the dp array as you go.

4. The maximum sum of a path in the entire tree is stored in the dp array for the root node.
