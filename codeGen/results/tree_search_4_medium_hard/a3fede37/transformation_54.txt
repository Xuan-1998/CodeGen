===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, taking into account its children.

Create a 2D table dp with size n x 3, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The first column represents the current node, the second column represents the maximum sum of the left child, and the third column represents the maximum sum of the right child.
dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2]) + tree[i-1]

For each node i in the range 1 to n:
    if i is a leaf node (i.e., it has no children):
        dp[i][0] = tree[i-1]
        dp[i][1] = -∞
        dp[i][2] = -∞

    else:
        Calculate the maximum sum of the left child and right child recursively:
            dp[i][1] = max(dp[j][0] + tree[j-1] for j in range(1, i))
            dp[i][2] = max(dp[k][0] + tree[k-1] for k in range(i+1, n))

    The maximum sum of a path ending at node i is the maximum of its left child's maximum sum and its right child's maximum sum plus the value of node i:
        dp[i][0] = max(dp[i][1], dp[i][2]) + tree[i-1]

The maximum sum of a path in the entire tree is stored in dp[0][0].

Return dp[0][0].
