===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, taking into account its children.

state expression: dp[i] = max(dp[leftChild], dp[rightChild]) + tree[node]

base case: when there are no more children
dp[node] = dp[node]

Consider implementing a top-down dynamic programming approach where you start from the root and gradually work your way down to the leaves, keeping track of the maximum sum for each node.
