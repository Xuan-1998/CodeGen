===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree using tabulation and top-down memoization.
The state expression is dp[i], representing the maximum sum of a path ending at node i.
    - Initialize dp array with zeros, size equal to the number of nodes in the tree.
    - For each node in the tree:
        + Calculate the maximum sum of paths ending at left child and right child by recursively calling the function and storing the results in the dictionary memo.
        + Update dp[i] as the maximum of:
            * The current value of dp[i]
            * The sum of the current node's value and the maximum sum of the path ending at the left child (memo[left child])
            * The sum of the current node's value and the maximum sum of the path ending at the right child (memo[right child])
    - Return the maximum sum of paths ending at the root node (dp[0]) as the result.
