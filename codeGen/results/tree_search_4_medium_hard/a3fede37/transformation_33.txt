===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, taking into account its children.

The state expression is dp[i] = max_sum_of_path_ending_at_node_i, which represents the maximum sum of a path ending at node i.
Consider a tree node as having three states: its value, the maximum sum of a path ending at its left child, and the maximum sum of a path ending at its right child.

Create a tabulated dynamic programming solution where you use a 1D array to store the maximum sum of a path for each node.
Initialize an empty list dp to store the maximum sum of a path for each node. 
Set the base case: If the input tree is empty, return 0 as there are no paths.

For each node in the tree from left to right:
    Calculate its maximum sum of a path ending at this node by taking the maximum value between the current node's value and the sum of its children' maximum sums.
    Store this calculated value in dp array.
Return the maximum value in the dp array as it represents the maximum sum of a path in the given binary tree.
