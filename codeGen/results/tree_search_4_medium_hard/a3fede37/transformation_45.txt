===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, taking into account its children.

dp[i] = max(dp[2*i+1], dp[2*i+2]) + tree[i]

The state expression considers that each node can be either the start or end of a path. Then, transition between these states based on whether a node's children are or are not part of a path.

Calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node by considering its children and recursively exploring the subtree rooted at the child nodes.
