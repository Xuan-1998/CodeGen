===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree using tabulation, and identify the optimal solution.

Define the state as a dictionary where dp[node] = total sum for node; the base case is when there are no more nodes.
dp[node] = max(dp[left_child], dp[right_child]) + value if node is an internal node
dp[node] = value if node is a leaf

Tabulate the state by initializing a dictionary dp with keys equal to the number of nodes in the tree, and then update each cell using bottom-up dynamic programming.

Start from the leaves (nodes with no children) and move upwards towards the root.
For each internal node, consider the maximum sum that can be obtained by traversing its left child, right child or both.
