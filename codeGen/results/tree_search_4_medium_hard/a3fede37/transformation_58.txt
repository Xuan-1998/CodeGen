===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, considering its children and their subtrees.

The state expression is dp[i][1] = tree[i-1], and dp[i][j] = max(dp[k][l-1] + tree[k-1] for k in range(i) for l in range(2)) where i represents the current node and j represents its child. The base case is when there are no more children.

dp[i] = max(sumPathLeft, sumPathRight) where sumPathLeft and sumPathRight are the maximum sums of paths through node's children

Use a recursive function with memoization to store the maximum sum of paths for each node and its children.
Memoize dp[i][j] as soon as it is calculated, to avoid redundant computation.

Recursively explore all subtrees rooted at i until no more child nodes exist. This is to calculate maxPathLeft and maxPathRight.
