===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree using tabulation, and identify the optimal solution.
Define the state as a dictionary where the key is the node value and the value is the total sum for that node.
Initialize the base case: dp[0] = 0
Iterate over each node in the tree:
    If it's the root node, calculate the maximum sum by considering both left and right subtrees.
    For other nodes:
        Calculate the maximum sum by adding the current node value to the maximum sum of its children (if they exist).
    Store the result in dp[node]
Return max(dp.values())
