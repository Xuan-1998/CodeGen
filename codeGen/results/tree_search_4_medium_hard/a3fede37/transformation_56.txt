===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, taking into account its children.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j+1]) + tree[i-1]
where i represents the current node and j represents its child. The base case is when there are no more children.
dp[i][0] = tree[i-1]  // or dp[i][-1] = tree[i-1]

Calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node using a recursive function with memorization.
