===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree using tabulation and memoization, and identify the optimal solution.

Define the state as a dictionary dp where dp[i] = max_sum for each node i. The base case is when there are no more nodes or the current node has no children.
Store the maximum sum for each node i as follows:
- If i is a leaf node (i.e., it has no children), then dp[i] = tree[i].
- For an internal node, consider its left and right subtrees. The maximum sum of a path ending at node i can be one of three possibilities:
  - The maximum sum of the left subtree.
  - The maximum sum of the right subtree.
  - A path that goes through the root node i and then down either the left or right subtree.

Update dp[i] to be the maximum of these three values.
