===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a recursive function that calculates the maximum sum of a path in the tree, and use memoization to store the results of subproblems.

Define the state as the node value, left subtree sum, right subtree sum, and the maximum path sum including this node. This allows for more flexibility in exploring different paths.
The state is the node value, left subtree sum, right subtree sum, and the maximum path sum including this node. The transition relationship is the maximum of the current maximum path sum and the maximum path sums of the left and right subtrees.

Use a dictionary to store the memoized values with the state (node value, left subtree sum, right subtree sum) as keys. This ensures that we don't recompute the same subproblem multiple times.

For each node in the tree, calculate the maximum path sum including this node by considering both the left and right subtrees. If the node is a leaf node, return its value as the maximum path sum. Otherwise, check if the state has been memoized before, and if so, return the stored value. If not, recursively calculate the maximum path sums of the left and right subtrees, store the result in the dictionary, and return it.
