===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree using dynamic programming (DP) and memoization. The state expression is dp[i][j], representing the maximum sum of a path from root to node j, including all nodes on that path.

1. Initialize a 2D array dp with size N x N where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
2. For each node i:
    - Traverse the left subtree (from root to leaf) and update dp[i][j] for each node j in the left subtree, considering the maximum sum that includes node j as a part of the path from root to j.
    - Update dp[i][i] with the value of node i itself.
3. For each node i:
    - Traverse the right subtree (from root to leaf) and update dp[i][j] for each node j in the right subtree, considering the maximum sum that includes node j as a part of the path from root to j.
4. The final result is stored in dp[0][N-1], representing the maximum sum of paths in the binary tree.
