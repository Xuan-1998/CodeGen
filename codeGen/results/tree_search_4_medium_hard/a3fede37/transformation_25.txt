===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree using dynamic programming and memoization, and identify the optimal solution.

Define the state as a tuple of (node, path_sum) where node represents the current node and path_sum is the sum of the current path.
Memoize the function that calculates the maximum sum for a given node by storing the results in a dictionary.

Base case: When there are no more nodes, return 0.

Function to calculate the maximum sum for a given node:
    - For each child node, recursively calculate the maximum sum and add it to the current path sum.
    - If the child node is null or its value is less than 0, set its value to 0 and continue with the next iteration.
    - Return the maximum of the current path sum and the sum of the left and right subtrees.

Function to construct the tree from the input array:
    - For each index in the array, consider it as a node and recursively construct its left and right children.

Example test case: 
- Input array: [1, 2, -3, 4, -5, 6]
- Expected output: 11 (the maximum sum of a path is 11, which can be achieved by traversing the nodes in the order 1 -> 2 -> 6)

This plan should correctly solve the problem and handle edge cases. It does not include unnecessary steps or redundant calculations.
