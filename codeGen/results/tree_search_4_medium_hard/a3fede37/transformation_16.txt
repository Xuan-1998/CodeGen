===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree using tabulation, and identify the optimal solution.

Let's start with initializing the dynamic programming table dp[][] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of a path from root to node j, including all nodes on that path. We'll initialize it with negative infinity for each cell except for the base case dp[0][0] which is 0 because the root has no parent.

Consider each node's maximum sum as its value in the dynamic programming table.
We can update the dp[][] table by considering all possible paths from the current node and updating dp[i][j] based on whether including or excluding the current node results in a larger path sum.

Use a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of a path from root to node j, including all nodes on that path.
We can use bottom-up dynamic programming for this problem. Start at the leaves and work our way up to the root by considering each node's maximum sum as its value in the dynamic programming table.
