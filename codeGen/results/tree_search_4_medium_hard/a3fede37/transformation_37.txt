===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, taking into account its children.
The state expression is dp[i] = max_sum_of_path_ending_at_node_i, which represents the maximum sum of a path ending at node i.
View each node's maximum sum of a path ending at it as the maximum of its own value, the value of its left child, the value of its right child, and the sums of paths ending at its children, recursively calculated for all child nodes.
Memoize the function that calculates the maximum sum of a path ending at a node and reuse previously calculated values.
Initialize dp with -1e9 to handle edge cases where there are no valid paths.
Sort the array by node indices to process nodes in the correct order.
Calculate max_sum_of_path_ending_at_node_i for each node i using its value, left child's maximum sum, right child's maximum sum, and sums of paths ending at its children.
