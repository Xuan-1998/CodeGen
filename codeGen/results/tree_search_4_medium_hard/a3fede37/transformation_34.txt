===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, taking into account its children.

The state expression is dp[i] = max_sum_of_path_ending_at_node_i, which represents the maximum sum of a path ending at node i.

Consider a tree node as having three states: its value, the maximum sum of a path ending at its left child, and the maximum sum of a path ending at its right child.

To avoid redundant calculations, use memoization by creating a dictionary to store the maximum sum of a path for each node. This way, you can look up previously computed values instead of recalculating them.

The plan is correct in terms of capturing the essence of dynamic programming and incorporating memoization. However, it would be beneficial to explicitly outline the base cases and recursive case.
