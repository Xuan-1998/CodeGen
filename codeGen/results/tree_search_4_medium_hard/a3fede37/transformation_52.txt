===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, considering its children.
The state expression is dp[node] = max(dp[leftChild], dp[rightChild]) + tree[node]
Base case: when there are no more children
dp[node] = tree[node]

To solve this problem efficiently, use memoization with recursive function calls to calculate the maximum sum for each node and its children.
