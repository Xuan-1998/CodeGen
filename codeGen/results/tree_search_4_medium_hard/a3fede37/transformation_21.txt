===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree using tabulation and memoization, and identify the optimal solution.

The state expression is dp[i][j], representing the maximum sum of a path from root i to node j, including all nodes on that path. Initialize the base case as dp[0][i] = arr[i].

Represent the recursive formula for state dp[i][j] as:

dp[i][j] = max(arr[j], dp[i-1][k] + arr[k]) for k in range(i)

Determine the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree using bottom-up dynamic programming, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum of a path from root i to node j.

Initialize the base case as dp[0][i] = arr[i]

For each node i in the tree:
    For each child k of node i:
        Update dp[i][k] with the maximum sum of a path from root i to node k

Return dp[-1][-1], representing the maximum sum of a path in the given binary tree.
