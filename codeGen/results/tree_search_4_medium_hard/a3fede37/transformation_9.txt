===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree using bottom-up dynamic programming, and identify the optimal solution.

The state expression is dp[i], representing the maximum sum of a path ending at node i.
dp[i] represents the maximum sum of a path ending at node i. Initialize it to the value of the current node i.

Update dp[i] based on the maximum sums of its left and right subtrees, considering that the maximum sum of a path is either:
- The value of the current node i
- The value of the current node i plus the maximum sum of the path ending at its left child (if it has one)
- The value of the current node i plus the maximum sum of the path ending at its right child (if it has one)

Use memoization to store the maximum sums of all nodes and their subtrees, then calculate the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree.

Finally, return the maximum value among all dp[i] as the maximum sum of a path in the binary tree.
