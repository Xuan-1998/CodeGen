===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, taking into account its children.

State expression: dp[i] = max_sum_of_path_ending_at_node_i, which represents the maximum sum of a path ending at node i.

To determine the maximum sum of a path ending at any node in the tree, consider the node's value and the maximum sums of paths ending at its left and right subtrees.

Store previously computed values in a dictionary for later use, reducing redundant computation and improving efficiency.

Initialize dp with -inf for all nodes.

Iterate over each node from leaf to root, updating dp based on the maximum sum of the path ending at that node's children, adding the node's value to it if the path includes the node.

Return the maximum value in dp as the maximum sum of a path in the binary tree.

Store previously computed values for future use by iterating over each node from leaf to root and updating the dp based on the maximum sum of the path ending at that node's children, adding the node's value to it if the path includes the node.
