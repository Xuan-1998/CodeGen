===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree using tabulation.

The state expression is dp[i][j], representing the maximum sum of a path from node i to node j, including all nodes on that path. 

Consider two cases: 
1. The maximum sum includes node i
2. The maximum sum does not include node i

Calculate the maximum sum for each case and store it in dp[i][j]

Use a 3D array dp[][][] to store the maximum sum of paths from root to node i, considering all nodes on that path.

The state expression is dp[i][j][k], representing the maximum sum of a path from root to node j, including all nodes on that path and considering k as the last included node

Initialize dp[0][j][0] for each node j to its value in the array

Update dp[i][j][k] by considering two cases:
1. The maximum sum includes node i
2. The maximum sum does not include node i

Calculate the maximum sum for each case and store it in dp[i][j][k]

The final answer is stored in dp[0][-1][-1], representing the maximum sum of a path from root to any node in the tree.
