===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree using tabulation, and identify the optimal solution.

Define the state as a dictionary where the key is the node value and the value is the total sum for that node. The base case is when there are no more nodes (i.e., the current node's children are empty). Initialize dp with the root node's value.

For each node in the tree:
    1. Calculate the maximum sum of a path ending at this node by considering its left and right child paths.
        * If the node has two children, calculate the maximum sum for both the left and right subtrees recursively.
        * If only one child exists, consider it as the path.
        * If no children exist (i.e., leaf node), set the sum to the node's value.

    2. Update dp with the calculated maximum sum of a path ending at this node.

Return dp[root] as the maximum sum of a path in the given binary tree.
