===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the maximum sum of a path by performing a depth-first search (DFS) in the tree and keep track of the maximum sum seen so far.
Define the state as a list of node values, dp[node] = maximum sum for each node in the tree. 
Use DFS to iterate through all nodes in the tree and update the dp array based on the value of the current node and its children.
The base case is when there are no more nodes or the current node has no children.
Return the maximum sum found in the dp array as the result.

===END PLAN===
