===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a recursive function that calculates the maximum sum of a path in the tree, and use memoization to store the results of subproblems.

Define the state as the node value and the maximum path sum including this node, considering both left and right subtrees. This allows for more flexibility in exploring different paths.

Use a dictionary to store the memoized values and update it recursively.
For each node, calculate the maximum path sum by considering its value plus the maximum path sum of its left subtree (if it exists) and its right subtree (if it exists). If the node is leaf, consider only its value.

Update the memoization table with this calculated maximum path sum for the current node. This ensures that we don't re-calculate the same subproblem multiple times.

Start from the root of the tree and recursively traverse down to each node, updating the memoization table as you go. The maximum path sum will be stored in the memoization table at the end, which corresponds to the root of the tree.

Finally, return the value stored at the root of the memoization table as the maximum sum of a path in the given binary tree.
