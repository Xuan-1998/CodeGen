===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, considering its parent and children.

The state expression is dp[i] = max(dp[2*i+1], dp[2*i+2]) + tree[i], where tree[i] is the value of the ith node in the binary tree. This base case considers that each node can be either the start or end of a path.

Consider the maximum sum of a path for each node, considering its parent and children. The state expression remains dp[i] = max(dp[2*i+1], dp[2*i+2]) + tree[i].

Utilize memoization to store the maximum sum of a path for each node in a dictionary, then fill it up iteratively using the state expression.

For edge cases, consider that the input binary tree is not empty and has at most 10^4 nodes. Also, the values of the nodes are between -1,000 and 1,000.

Finally, return the maximum sum of a path calculated for each node.
