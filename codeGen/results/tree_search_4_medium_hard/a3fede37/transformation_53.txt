===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, taking into account its children.

The state expression is dp[node][0] = tree[node], and dp[node][1] = max(dp[leftChild][0], dp[rightChild][0]) + tree[node]. The base case is when there are no more children. In this case, the maximum sum of a path for the node itself.

dp[node] = max(dp[leftChild][1], dp[rightChild][1])

Explore the idea of using a top-down dynamic programming approach where you start from the root and recursively compute the maximum sum for each node and its children.
