===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the maximum sum of a path by iterating through all possible paths in the tree using dynamic programming, and identify the optimal solution.

Define the state as a dictionary dp where dp[node] = total sum for node. The base case is when there are no more nodes (i.e., when the node has no children).

Use a recursive approach to calculate the maximum sum for a given node, considering its left child, right child, and itself, and store the results in the dp dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

To handle edge cases:

* For leaf nodes, the maximum path sum is the value of the node itself.
* For nodes with no children, the maximum path sum is the value of the node itself.
* For nodes with only one child (either left or right), the maximum path sum is the value of the node plus the maximum path sum of its single child.

To optimize the recursive approach:

* Use memoization to store and reuse previously calculated results in the dp dictionary, avoiding redundant calculations.
* Start from the root node and traverse the tree in a bottom-up manner, calculating the maximum path sums for each node as you go.
