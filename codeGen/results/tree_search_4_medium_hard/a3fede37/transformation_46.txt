===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, considering its children and parent nodes.

State expression: 
dp[i] = max(dp[2*i+1], dp[2*i+2]) + tree[i]

This base case considers that each node can be either the start or end of a path. 

Define two states: one for nodes that are part of a path (dp_true[i]) and another for nodes that are not (dp_false[i]). Then, transition between these states based on whether a node's children are or are not part of a path.

State transition equation:
dp_true[i] = max(dp_true[2*i+1], dp_true[2*i+2]) + tree[i]

To find the maximum sum of a path in the binary tree, you can simply return the maximum value from the dp array.
Return max(dp)

This plan is correct and provides a good starting point for solving this problem. The dynamic programming approach will allow us to avoid redundant calculations and efficiently compute the maximum sum of a path.
