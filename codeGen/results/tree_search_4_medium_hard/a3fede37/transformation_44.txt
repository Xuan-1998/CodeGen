===BEGIN PLAN===
Formulate a dynamic programming approach where you calculate the maximum sum of a path for each node, taking into account its children.
The state expression is dp[i] = max(dp[2*i+1], dp[2*i+2]) + tree[i], where tree[i] is the value of the ith node in the binary tree and 0-indexing is used. This base case considers that each node can be either the start or end of a path.
Consider the maximum sum of a path for each node, taking into account its parent and children. The state expression is dp[i] = max(dp[2*i+1], dp[2*i+2]) + tree[i], where tree[i] is the value of the ith node in the binary tree.
Implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by defining a function that calculates the maximum sum of a path for a given node and its children. The function should return the maximum sum of a path for each node, taking into account its parent and children.
