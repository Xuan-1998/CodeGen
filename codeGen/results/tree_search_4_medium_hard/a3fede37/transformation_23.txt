===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine the maximum sum of a path by performing a depth-first search (DFS) through the tree, and identify the optimal solution.

The state expression is dp[i], representing the maximum sum of a path from node i. Initialize all dp[i] values to -âˆž.

Represent the state dp[i] as the maximum sum of a path from node i:

1.  For each node i:
    *   Initialize dp[i] to the value at node i.
    *   Recursively explore the left and right subtrees, updating dp[i] with the maximum sum of the paths that include these nodes.

Use memoization to store and reuse previously computed results for subproblems, allowing you to avoid redundant calculations and optimize the solution.

To find the maximum sum of a path in the entire tree, return max(dp[]).
