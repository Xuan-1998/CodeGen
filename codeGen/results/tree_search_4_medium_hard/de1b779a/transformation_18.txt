===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types.

The base case could be when there's no dough left (i = 0) or no stuffing types left (j = 0).

dp[i-1][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i-1 grams of dough and j stuffing types when there's no dough left, because we can't make any more buns.

Another possibility could be that the state is the remaining amount of dough (i) and the maximum profit achievable with i grams of dough. The transition relationship would then depend on whether it's more profitable to make a bun with the current stuffing type or not, considering the price of the bun, the cost of the stuffing, and the cost of making the bun without any stuffing.

The plan should also consider the cases where we have enough dough for a bun but no stuffing left (j = 0) or vice versa. In these cases, we can only make buns without stuffing or use up all the remaining dough.

Create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types.

The updated version of the plan includes edge cases such as when there's no dough left, no stuffing left, or both.
