===BEGIN PLAN===
Represent the state using a 3D array dp[i][j][k] where dp[i][j][k] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough, j stuffing types, and k buns made so far. The transition relationship could be formulated as: 
dp[i][j][k] = max(dp[i-1][j][0], dp[max(0, i-ci[j])][j-1][0] + di[j]) if k > 0; otherwise, dp[i][j][k] is the base case when there's not enough dough to make any buns, regardless of the number of stuffing types available. 
dp[0][j][k] = 0 for all j and k.
Initialize dp with these base cases.
Fill up the dp table row by row from top to bottom and column by column from left to right.
