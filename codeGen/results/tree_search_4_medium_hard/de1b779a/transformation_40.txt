===BEGIN PLAN===
The subproblem structure could be to decide whether to make a bun with the current stuffing type, or not. This would lead to a recursive formula which can then be memoized.

The state is (dough_left, stuffings_used), where dough_left is the amount of dough left and stuffings_used is a boolean indicating whether any stuffing has been used yet.

The subproblem could be to decide how many buns to make with the current stuffing type, considering the remaining dough and stuffings. The function would take in (dough_left, stuffings_used) as input and return the maximum profit that can be earned given those constraints.

The base case would be when there is no more dough left or all the stuffings have been used up. In this case, the maximum profit would be 0 since we cannot make any more buns.

To solve the problem recursively, we can consider two options:
- Make a bun with the current stuffing type: If we have enough dough and stuffing for one bun, we can earn di amount of money by selling it.
- Do not make a bun with the current stuffing type: In this case, we cannot earn any money from selling buns.

We need to recursively call the function for both options and take the maximum profit. We also need to update the state accordingly (dough_left -= ci; stuffings_used = True if ai > 0 else False).

To avoid repeating the same subproblem multiple times, we can use memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a table.

The final solution would be the maximum value in this table for the initial state (n, False), where n is the amount of dough left initially and False indicates that no stuffing has been used yet.
