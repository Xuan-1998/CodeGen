===BEGIN PLAN===
Represent the state using a 3D array dp where dp[i][j][k] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough, j stuffing types, and k buns. The transition relationship could be formulated as:
dp[i][j][k] = max(dp[i-1][0][0], dp[i-ci[j]][j-1][min(k+di[j]/ci[j], c0/ci[j])]) + di[j].
The first term represents the maximum profit that can be achieved without using any stuffing, and the second term represents the maximum profit that can be achieved by using the j-th stuffing.
The constraint k+di[j]/ci[j] â‰¤ c0/ci[j] ensures that we do not exceed the available dough. The constraint min(k+di[j]/ci[j], c0/ci[j]) ensures that we do not exceed the available dough and the number of buns.
