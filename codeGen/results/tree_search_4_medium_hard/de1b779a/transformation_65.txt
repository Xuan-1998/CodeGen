===BEGIN PLAN===
Represent the state using a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types.

The transition relationship could be formulated as:

dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], c0)

This is because when there are no more stuffing types to consider, we have two options: either make buns without any stuffing (which will use up the initial amount of dough) or make buns with the available dough.

For j > 0:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-ci[j]][j-1], dp[i][j-1]) + di[j]

This is because we have two options: either make buns with the i-th stuffing (which will use up ci[j] grams of dough) or make buns without any stuffing. The maximum profit we can achieve by making buns with the i-th stuffing is dp[i-ci[j]][j-1], and the maximum profit we can achieve by not using this stuffing is dp[i][j-1]. We add di[j] to the maximum of these two options.

The base case for j > 0 is:

dp[0][j] = 0

This is because we cannot make any buns with zero grams of dough, regardless of the number of stuffing types available.

Finally, the answer is dp[n][m].
