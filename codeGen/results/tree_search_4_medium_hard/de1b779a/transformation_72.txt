===BEGIN PLAN===
Represent the state using a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types.

The transition relationship could be formulated as: 
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-ci[j]][j-1]) + di[j]

dp[0][j] is the base case when there's not enough dough to make any buns, regardless of the number of stuffing types available.

Consider representing the state as dp[i][j] where 
dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types

Using memoization by storing the computed values in a dictionary where the key is the state (i, j) and the value is the corresponding maximum profit.

Additionally, consider initializing dp[0][0] to d0 as it represents the base case when there's no dough or stuffing available.
