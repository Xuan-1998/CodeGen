===BEGIN PLAN===
The subproblem structure could be to decide whether to make a bun with the current stuffing type, or not. This would lead to a recursive formula, which can then be memoized.

Let's use (stuffing_type, dough_left) as the state expression.

State: ((total_profit, current_stuff), (dough_left))
Transition: 
  - If the dough_left is less than c0, return total_profit
  - For each stuffing type i:
    - Calculate the profit if we make a bun with the i-th stuffing: di - bi + max(0, ci - c0)
    - Recursively calculate the maximum profit for the remaining dough_left and the current stuff: dp((stuffing_type, dough_left - c0), i)
    - Return the maximum of the two profits

Use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems, and for each new state, check if it has been computed before and return the stored result if true.

Let's also keep track of the maximum profit we can get with the given amount of dough, so we'll maintain another variable max_profit = 0. When we calculate the total_profit in the dp function, update max_profit if necessary.

When we're done calculating the maximum profit for all states, return the stored value of max_profit.
