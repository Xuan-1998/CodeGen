===BEGIN PLAN===
The subproblem structure could be to decide whether to make a bun with the current stuffing type, or without. This would lead to a recursive formula, which can then be memoized.

The state is (i, j), where i represents the current stuffing type, and j represents the remaining dough grams.

dp[i][j] = max(
    dp[i][j], 
    min(dp[k][n] for k in range(m) if k != i) + di
) for 0 <= j <= n

Memoization by defining a recursive function and storing the results in a dictionary.
