===BEGIN PLAN===
Represent the state using a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types.
The transition relationship could be formulated as: 
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[max(0, i-ci[j])][min(j-1, m-1)]) + di[0]
where the maximum number of buns that can be made with i grams of dough and j stuffing types is determined by the available dough and stuffings.
dp[0][j] is the base case when there's not enough dough to make any buns, regardless of the number of stuffing types available.
The updated version of the plan includes edge cases such as handling the situation where there are no stuffing types available (i.e., j = 0) and handling the situation where there is only one type of stuffing available (i.e., j = m).
