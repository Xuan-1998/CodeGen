===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types.

Base case:
dp[0][j] = 0 for all j (no dough left)
dp[i][0] = d0 for all i (no stuffing types left)

Recursive relation:
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + di, dp[i-ci][j-1] + bi) if ai > 0
dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] if ai == 0

Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table.
