===BEGIN PLAN===
Represent the state using a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types. The transition relationship could be formulated as: 
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-ci[j]][j-1]) + di[j].

dp[i][0] is the base case when there are no more stuffing types to consider, and it's equal to the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough without any stuffing. 

Use dynamic programming to fill up the dp array row by row from top to bottom, considering the base cases when there are no more stuffing types or dough left.

For each cell in the dp array, calculate the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types. If j is 0, it means we have run out of all stuffing types, so we should use the previous row's maximum profit for cells with i-1 grams of dough. If i-ci[j] > 0, it means we still have enough dough to make buns using the current stuffing type, so we should calculate the maximum profit that can be achieved with i-ci[j] grams of dough and j-1 stuffing types.

The base case for dp[i][j] is when either i or j is 0. In this case, dp[i][j] is equal to the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough without any stuffing (dp[i][0]) or the maximum profit that can be achieved with 1 gram of dough and j-1 stuffing types (dp[ci[j]][j-1]), respectively.

Finally, return dp[n][m] as the maximum profit that can be achieved with n grams of dough and m stuffing types.
