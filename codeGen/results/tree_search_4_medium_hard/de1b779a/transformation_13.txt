===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types.

For each possible state (i, j), consider two options:
1. Do not use any stuffing type: In this case, the maximum profit would be d0 * min(i/c0, m) (sell all dough without using any stuffing).
2. Use one of the remaining stuffing types: In this case, consider each stuffing type and calculate the maximum profit that can be achieved by using it. The maximum profit is then the maximum of these profits.

Base cases:
- When there's no dough left (i = 0), the maximum profit would be 0.
- When there are no stuffing types left (j = 0), the maximum profit would be d0 * min(n/c0, m).

Memoization:
Implement memoization using a dictionary to store the computed values, where the key is a tuple of (i, j) and the value is the corresponding dp[i][j] value.
