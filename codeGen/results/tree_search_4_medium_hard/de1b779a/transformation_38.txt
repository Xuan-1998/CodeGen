===BEGIN PLAN===
The subproblem structure could be to decide whether to make a bun with the current stuffing type, or without any stuffing. This would lead to a recursive formula, which can then be memoized.

The state is (i, j), where i represents the current stuffing type, and j represents the remaining dough grams.

dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j-ci] + di) for 0 <= j <= n

Using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with two loops:
    for m types of stuffing
        for n grams of dough

This plan is correct in general. However, it might not consider the edge case where Lavrenty runs out of dough or stuffings.

To improve this plan, we could add an additional condition to check if there is enough dough and stuffing left before making a decision.

Here's the updated version:
