===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types.

The base case could be when there's no dough left (i = 0) or no stuffing types left (j = 0). This would mean we have already exhausted all options and the maximum profit is 0.

dp[i-1][j] represents the maximum profit that can be achieved with i-1 grams of dough and j stuffing types when there's no dough left. This state corresponds to running out of dough and moving on to the next option.

The transition relationship is that for each stuffing type, there are three options:

1. Make a bun with this stuffing type and use up some dough: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-c][j-1] + (d - c) * p)
2. Not make a bun at all and keep the dough and stuffing for later: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
3. Run out of the current stuffing type and move on to the next one: dp[i][c0][j-1]

The final answer would be dp[n][m], which represents the maximum profit that can be achieved with n grams of dough and m stuffing types.
