===BEGIN PLAN===
The subproblem structure could be to decide whether to make a bun with the current stuffing type, or not. This would lead to a recursive formula, which can then be memoized.

The state is (dough_left, stuffings_used), where dough_left is the amount of dough left and stuffings_used is a boolean indicating whether any stuffing has been used yet.

The subproblem could be to decide which stuffing type to use for the next bun, considering the remaining dough and each stuffing's availability. The state would be (dough_left, available_stuffs), where dough_left is the amount of dough left and available_stuffs is a list indicating which stuffings are still available.

Create a 2D DP array dp[n][m] to store the maximum profit for each possible state (dough_left, stuffings_used). 

dp[i][j] = max {
  (price of bun with stuffing[j]) * min(dough left / dough required by this stuffing, amount of this stuffing left)
  + dp[i - c0][j]
  if dough left >= c0

  price of plain bun
  + dp[i - d0][0]
  if j = 0 (no stuffing used)

}

Initialize the DP array with base cases.

Fill in the DP array by iterating through each state and applying the recursive formula.

Return dp[n][m] as the maximum profit.
