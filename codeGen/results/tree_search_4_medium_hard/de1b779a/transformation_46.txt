===BEGIN PLAN===
The subproblem structure could be to decide whether to make a bun with the current stuffing type or without it, considering the remaining dough and stuffings left. This would lead to a recursive formula, which can then be memoized.

Let's use (stuffing_type, remaining_dough) as the state expression.
State: (stuffing_type, remaining_dough), Transition:
  - If no stuffing types are left or no dough is left, don't make a bun and return 0
  - If enough dough is left to make a bun with the current stuffing type, decide whether to make it or not
    * Make a bun: calculate the profit from selling the bun (di) minus the cost of making it (bi + ci), add this to the maximum profit from the previous state without the current stuffing type
    * Don't make a bun: return the maximum profit from the previous state without the current stuffing type
  - If not enough dough is left to make a bun with the current stuffing type, don't make it and return the maximum profit from the previous state without the current stuffing type

Implement memoization by defining a recursive function with memoization dictionary, where the key is (stuffing_type, remaining_dough) and the value is the maximum profit.
