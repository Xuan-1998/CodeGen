===BEGIN PLAN===
Represent the state using a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types. The transition relationship could be formulated as:
dp[i][j] = max(
    (i >= c0) ? di[0] : -1, // base case when there's not enough dough to make any buns
    (j > 0) ? dp[i-c0][j-1] + di[j-1] : -1 // transition relation: use the current stuffing type or not
)
dp[0][j] is the base case when there's not enough dough to make any buns, regardless of the number of stuffing types available.

Use memoization by defining a function max_profit(i, j) that returns the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types.
The state could represent the total amount of dough used, i.e., dp[i] is the maximum profit that can be achieved by using i grams of dough
