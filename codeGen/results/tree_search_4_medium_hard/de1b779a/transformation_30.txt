===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a table dp[n][m] where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types. The base case could be when there's no dough left (i == 0) or no stuffing types left (j == m).

// Base cases
dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since we can't make any buns if we have no dough.
dp[i][0] = d0 * min(c0 // bi, n / ci) for all i, since we can only make buns with the first type of stuffing.

// Fill the table in bottom-up manner
for i from 1 to n:
    for j from 1 to m:
        if ai[j] > 0 and i >= bi[j]:
            // Make a bun with the j-th stuffing type, or don't make any buns at all.
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - bi[j]][j - 1] + di[j], d0 * min(c0 // bi[j], n / ci[j]))
        else:
            // We can't make a bun with the j-th stuffing type, so we don't make any buns.
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]

// The maximum profit is stored in dp[n][m].
