===BEGIN PLAN===
Represent the state using a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types. The transition relationship could be formulated as:
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-ci[j]][j-1]) + di[j].
This plan correctly identifies the state and transition relationships needed to solve the problem.

However, there are a few issues with this plan:

* It does not take into account the constraint that Lavrenty cannot make buns if he runs out of dough. This could be handled by adding an additional condition in the transition relationship.
* The plan does not specify how to handle the edge case where i or j is 0.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
