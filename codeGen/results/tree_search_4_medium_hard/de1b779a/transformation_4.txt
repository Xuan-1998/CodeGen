===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types.

dp[0][j] = 0 for all j (base case when there's no dough left)
dp[i][0] = d0 for all i (base case when there are no stuffing types left)

The state could be dp[i][j] = (profit, i-remaining_dough, j-stuffing_types) where the profit is the maximum value we can get with i dough and j stuffing types.

Transition relationships:
1. Make a bun without any stuffing: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + d0
2. Make a bun with the current stuffing type: if ai > 0, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-ci][j-1], dp[i-ci][j]) + di

Memoization using a dictionary to store previously computed results.

dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types when making buns with different stuffings or without any stuffing.
