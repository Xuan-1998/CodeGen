===BEGIN PLAN===
Represent the state using a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types.

The transition relationship could be formulated as:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][0], (max(0, n - c[j])) * d[j])

where n is the total amount of dough available, c[j] is the amount of dough required to make a bun with the j-th stuffing, and d[j] is the price at which a bun with the j-th stuffing can be sold.

Use bottom-up tabulation by initializing a 2D array dp of size n+1 and m+1, filling it up using nested loops, and returning the maximum value in the last cell: dp[n][m].
