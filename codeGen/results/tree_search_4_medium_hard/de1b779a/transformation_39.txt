===BEGIN PLAN===
The subproblem structure could be to decide whether to make a bun with the current stuffing type, or not. This would lead to a recursive formula, which can then be memoized.

The state is (dough_left, stuffings_used), where dough_left is the amount of dough left and stuffings_used is a boolean indicating whether any stuffing has been used yet.

The subproblem could be to decide how many buns to make with the current stuffing type, considering the remaining dough and stuffings. The state would be (dough_left - c_i, True), where c_i is the amount of dough required for one bun with the i-th stuffing, and True indicates that some stuffing has been used.

The transition function could be: 
- If ai > 0 and dough_left >= ci, make buns with the current stuffing type until either ai becomes 0 or dough_left becomes less than ci. Then, update state as (dough_left - ci * (ai / bi), False) if no stuffing was used before.
- Otherwise, do not use the current stuffing type, and update state as (dough_left, False).

The base case could be when no more dough is left or all stuffings have been used. In this case, return 0.

DP with 2D Tabulation using a Table:
Create a table dp[m+1][n+1] where m is the number of stuffing types and n is the amount of dough.
The base case would be when no more dough is left (i.e., dp[i][j] = 0 for j < c0).
For each i from 0 to m, and each j from c0 to n:
- If there's enough dough to make a bun with the current stuffing type (dough_left >= ci), calculate the maximum profit by making buns or not.
- Otherwise, do not use the current stuffing type.

The final answer would be dp[m][n].
