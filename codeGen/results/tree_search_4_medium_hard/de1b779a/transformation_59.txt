===BEGIN PLAN===
Represent the state using a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types.

Define state s as (i, j) representing the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types. The transition relationship could be formulated as: 
dp[s] = max(dp[(s[0]-c[s[1]], s[1])], dp[(s[0], s[1]-1)]) + d[s[1]].
where c is the array of ci values, d is the array of di values.

Implement dynamic programming by iterating over all possible states from s=(n, m) to (0, 0), and updating dp[s] according to the transition relationship. The maximum profit can be achieved when s=(n, 0).

The plan includes edge cases: it correctly handles situations where no stuffing is used or only one type of stuffing is available.

This plan is correct, but it's missing a crucial step - initializing the base case. Initialize dp[0][j] to d[j] for all j from 0 to m-1, and initialize dp[i][0] to c0 for all i from 1 to n. This ensures that the dynamic programming algorithm starts with correct values.

The plan also assumes that ci values are not greater than i, which is a crucial constraint given in the problem statement.
