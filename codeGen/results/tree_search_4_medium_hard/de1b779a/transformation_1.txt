===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types.

Base case: when there's no dough left (i = 0) or no stuffing types left (j = 0).

dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types when making buns with different stuffings or without any stuffing.

Transition relationship:
- Calculate dp[i][0] by considering using no stuffing type, which would be the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough.
- For each stuffing type (j from 1 to m):
    - Calculate the maximum profit when using the j-th stuffing type: ci + max(0, ai - bi) * di.
    - Update dp[i][j] as the maximum between this and the current value.

Memoization with dictionary:
Store the calculated values in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.
