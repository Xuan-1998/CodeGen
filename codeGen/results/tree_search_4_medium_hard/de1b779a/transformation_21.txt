===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types.

The base case could be when there's no dough left (i = 0) or no stuffing types left (j = 0). In this case, dp[0][j] would be d0 for all j, since Lavrenty can't make any buns without dough. Similarly, dp[i][0] would be c0 for all i, since he can only use the initial amount of dough.

The transition relationship would then depend on whether it's more profitable to use a new stuffing type or not, considering the price of the buns with different stuffing types and the cost of the current dough. This could be implemented as:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1] + (d-j) * p[j])

The final answer would be the maximum value in the last row of the table, i.e., dp[n][m].
