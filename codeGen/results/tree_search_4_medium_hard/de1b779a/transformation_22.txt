===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types. The base case could be when there's no dough left (i = 0) or no stuffing types left (j = 0).

dp[0][j] would represent the maximum profit that can be achieved without using any dough, considering the different stuffing types.

The state transition relationship would depend on whether it's more profitable to use a new stuffing type or not. For each amount of dough i and number of stuffing types j:

- If j > 0, then dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], dp[max(0, i-ci)] + di)

This means that if we have some dough left (i >= ci), we can make a bun with the current stuffing type. The maximum profit would be either not using this stuffing type at all (dp[i][j-1]) or making a bun and selling it for price di.

- If j = 0, then dp[i][j] = d0

This is the base case when there's no stuffing types left. In this case, we can only make plain buns and earn a maximum profit of d0 per bun.

Use a separate array to store the maximum profit for each amount of dough, and then iterate over the stuffing types within each dough quantity.
