===BEGIN PLAN===
The subproblem structure could be to decide whether to make a bun with the current stuffing type, or not. This would lead to a recursive formula, which can then be memoized.

The state is (dough_left, stuffings_used), where dough_left is the amount of dough left and stuffings_used is a boolean indicating whether any stuffing has been used yet.

The subproblem could be to decide how many buns to make with the current stuffing type, considering the remaining dough and stuffings. The state would be (dough_left - c_i, true) if we use this stuffing, or (dough_left, false) if we don't. If the amount of dough left is less than the required dough for a bun, then it's not possible to make any more buns.

Use memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid recomputation. The final answer would be the maximum value in the memoized table.
