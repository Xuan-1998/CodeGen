===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a table dp[i] where dp[i] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough. The base case could be when there's no dough left (i = 0).

dp[0] = 0, since it's not possible to make any buns without any dough.

For each gram of dough from 1 to n:
    - dp[i] is the maximum of two possibilities:
        * Make a bun with one of the stuffing types: This would require bi grams of stuffing and ci grams of dough. If there are enough stuffing and dough, calculate the profit pi = di - bi - ci.
        * Don't make a bun with any stuffing: In this case, no stuffing or dough is required, so the profit would be 0.
    Compare the profits from these two possibilities and take the maximum.
