===BEGIN PLAN===
The subproblem structure could be to decide whether to make a bun with the current stuffing type, or not. This would lead to a recursive formula, which can then be memoized.

The state is (dough_left, stuffings_used), where dough_left is the amount of dough left and stuffings_used is a boolean indicating whether any stuffing has been used yet.

The subproblem could be to decide which stuffing type to use for the next bun, considering the remaining dough and each stuffing's availability. The state would be (dough_left, available_stuffs), where dough_left is the amount of dough left and available_stuffs is a list indicating which stuffings are still available.

Use a 3D DP array to store the maximum profit for each possible state (dough_left, available_stuffs), considering the current stuffing's availability and whether it should be used or not. The DP array would have dimensions dp[dmax][smax][2], where dmax is the maximum amount of dough left, smax is the number of available stuffings, and the last dimension represents the state (dough_left, stuffings_used).

The base case for the DP would be when there's no more dough or no more stuffing available. In this case, the maximum profit would be 0.

For each possible state, consider the current stuffing type's availability and calculate the maximum profit by either using it to make a bun (if there's enough dough) or not using it at all. The choice would depend on whether it's more profitable to use the stuffing or not.

The final answer would be the maximum value in the DP array for the initial state (n, false).

This plan seems correct and takes into account edge cases.
