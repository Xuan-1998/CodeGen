===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types. The base case could be when there's no dough left (i = 0) or no stuffing types left (j = 0).

dp[0][j] = 0, since we can't make any buns without dough
dp[i][0] = 0, since we can't use different stuffings if there are none

The transition relationship could be a recursive function that calculates the maximum profit by either using the current stuffing type or not, considering the cost and profit of each option.

For i > 0 and j > 0:
- If ai <= i and bi <= c0 (i.e., we have enough dough and stuffing to make at least one bun), then we can consider two options:
  - Make a bun with the current stuffing type: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], di + dp[i-ci][j-1])
  - Don't use any stuffing: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], d0)
- If ai > i or bi > c0, then we can't make a bun with the current stuffing type, so we just consider not using any stuffing: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], d0)

The final answer is dp[n][m]
