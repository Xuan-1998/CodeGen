===BEGIN PLAN===
The subproblem structure could be to decide whether to make a bun with the current stuffing type, or not. This would lead to a recursive formula, which can then be memoized.

Let's use (stuffing_type, dough_left) as the state expression.

State: (total_profit, remaining_dough)
Transition:
	1. If we have enough dough and stuffing for a bun, consider making it.
	2. Otherwise, don't make a bun.

Implement memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary, using (stuffing_type, dough_left) as the key.

Consider adding edge cases, such as when there's no more dough or stuffing left.
