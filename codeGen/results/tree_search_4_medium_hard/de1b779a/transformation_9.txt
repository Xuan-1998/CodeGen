===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types. The base case could be when there's no dough left (i = 0) or no stuffing types left (j = 0).

i = n, j = 0
dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with n grams of dough without any stuffing type.

For each i and j:
- If it's not possible to make a bun with the current amount of dough and stuffings (i < c0 or all ai = 0), then dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
- Otherwise, consider two options: 
  * Make a bun without any stuffing type: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], d0)
  * Use the current amount of dough and stuffings to make a bun with one of the j stuffing types:
    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - c0][j - 1] + di)

Fill in the table iteratively, starting from the base cases.
