===BEGIN PLAN===
Represent the state using a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types. The transition relationship could be formulated as:
dp[i][0] = max(0, dp[i-c0][0])
for j from 1 to m
    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-ci[j]][j-1], dp[i][j-1]) + di[j]
Create a variable max_profit = dp[n][m]
Return max_profit
===END PLAN===
