===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types.

For base cases:
i = 0, j = 0: dp[0][0] = d0
dp[i][0] = max(0, dp[i-c0][0]) // if no stuffing types left, we cannot make any buns

For filling up the table:
For each i from c0 to n and for each j from 0 to m:
    If j == 0: // without any stuffing
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-c0][j], d0) // if no dough left, we can only sell buns
    Else:
        For each k from 0 to j-1:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-ci[k]][k] + di[k], dp[i][j]) // consider using the current stuffing type or not

For edge cases:
i == c0, j > 0: dp[c0][j] = d0 // if no dough left and we have some stuffing types, we cannot make any buns
i < c0, j > 0: dp[i][j] = dp[c0][j-1] // if we don't have enough dough to use the current stuffing type

Return dp[n][m]
