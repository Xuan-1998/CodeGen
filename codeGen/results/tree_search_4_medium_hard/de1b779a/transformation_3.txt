===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types.

dp[i][0] = d0 * min(n, i/c0) - c0 * min(n, i/c0) represents the maximum profit when there's no stuffing type left (j=0). Here, d0 is the price per bun without any stuffing, c0 is the cost of making a bun without any stuffing, n is the total amount of dough, and i is the current remaining dough.

dp[0][j] = 0 for all j represents the maximum profit when there's no dough left (i=0). This is because we can't make any buns with no dough.

The state could be dp[i][j] = (profit, i-remaining_dough, j-stuffing_types) where the profit is the maximum value we can get with i dough and j stuffing types. The transition relationship could be to consider all possible cases when making a bun with the current stuffing type or not.

Dynamic programming using 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types.
