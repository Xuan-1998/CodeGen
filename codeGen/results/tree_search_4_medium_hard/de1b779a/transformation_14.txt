===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types. The base case could be when there's no dough left (i = 0) or no stuffing types left (j = 0).

dp[0][j] = d0 for all j, because without any dough, we can only sell buns without stuffing.

For i > 0 and j > 0:

- If the current amount of dough is enough to make a bun with stuffing: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-ci][j-1] + di, dp[i][j-1]) where ci is the amount of dough required for the i-th stuffing.
- If not, we can only sell buns without stuffing, so dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1].

Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types.

Fill in the base case for i = 0 or j = 0.
Initialize dp[0][0] = d0.

Fill in the remaining cells using the above recurrence relation.
dp[n][m] will give us the maximum profit that can be achieved with n grams of dough and m stuffing types.
