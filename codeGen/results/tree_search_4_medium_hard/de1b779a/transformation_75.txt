===BEGIN PLAN===
Represent the state using a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the maximum profit that can be achieved with i grams of dough and j stuffing types.

The base case would be when there's not enough dough to make any buns, regardless of the number of stuffing types available: dp[0][j] = 0 for all j.
For non-base cases, the state transition could be formulated as:
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][0], max(dp[i-ci[k]][k-1] + di[k] for k in range(j))) where k iterates over the stuffing types.

The final answer would be dp[n][m].
