===BEGIN PLAN===
Represent the state using a 1D array dp where dp[i] is the maximum profit that can be achieved by selling i buns. The transition relationship could be formulated as:

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], max(dp[i-ci][j-1]) + di) for all j and ci > 0

dp[0] is the base case when there's not enough dough to make any buns.

For each i from n down to c0, calculate dp[i] as:

dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-ci]+di) for all j and ci > 0

The maximum profit that can be achieved is stored in dp[n].
