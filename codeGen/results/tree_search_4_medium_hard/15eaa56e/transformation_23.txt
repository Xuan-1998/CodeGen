===BEGIN PLAN===
To find the smallest subproblem that can be solved optimally by considering a single column at a time. You could consider iterating over each element in the table, and checking if it's less than or equal to its adjacent elements in the same column.

The state expression could be a pair (is_sorted, max_val) where is_sorted is a boolean indicating whether the subtable is sorted up to each element and max_val is an integer representing the maximum value in the subtable up to each element. The base case would be when the subtable consists of only one row, in which case it's always True and the maximum value is simply the maximum value in that row.

The state could be a pair (row_sorted, col_max) where row_sorted is a boolean indicating whether the subtable is sorted along the current row, and col_max is an integer representing the maximum value in the subtable up to each column. The transition relationship would involve checking if the current element is less than or equal to its adjacent elements in the same row.

Memoize the dynamic programming function recursively to avoid redundant computation.

When processing a task (l, r), check if all rows from l to r are sorted in at least one column. If yes, return "Yes", otherwise return "No".

To improve the plan, consider using a 2D array to store the state values instead of recursion to reduce time complexity.

Potential issues with the plan include handling edge cases where l = 1 or r = n, and considering all possible subtables that are not fully covered by the given tasks. The plan does not explicitly address these edge cases.

To ensure the plan handles edge cases correctly, consider adding additional conditions to handle these scenarios.
