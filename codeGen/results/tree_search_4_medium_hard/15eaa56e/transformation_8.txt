===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming with a two-dimensional table. The state at each cell represents whether the subtable is sorted in non-decreasing order up to that point.

State expression: A tuple containing the maximum value and the count of non-decreasing elements in the subtable up to the current row.
Base case: When the subtable has only one row, where the maximum value is the single element and the count is 1.

The transition relationship would be updating this state based on the sorting status of the subtables. For each element in the subtable:
- If the element is not greater than the previous element in the same column, increment the count.
- If the element is greater than the previous element in the same column, reset the count to 1 and update the maximum value.

The dynamic programming table would be initialized with the base case for each row. Then, for each cell in the table:
- Check if the count is greater than or equal to the number of rows in the subtable. If so, return "Yes", indicating that the subtable is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- Otherwise, update the state based on the transition relationship and move to the next cell.

For each task consisting of a range [l, r] of rows:
- Iterate through the dynamic programming table to find the maximum value in the range [1, l-1]. This would give us the maximum value up to the current row.
- Check if this maximum value is equal to or less than the minimum value in the range [l, r]. If so, return "Yes", indicating that the subtable is sorted in non-decreasing order.
