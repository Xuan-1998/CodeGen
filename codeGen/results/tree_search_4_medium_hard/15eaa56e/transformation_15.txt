===BEGIN PLAN===
To find the smallest subproblem that can be solved optimally by considering a single column at a time. You could consider iterating over each element in the table, and checking if it's less than or equal to its adjacent elements in the same column.

The state expression could be a boolean indicating whether the subtable is sorted up to each element, with the initial state being False for all elements. The base case would be when the subtable consists of only one row, in which case it's always True.

State: dp[i][j] = a boolean indicating whether the jth column is sorted up to the ith row; Transition: 
    1. Initialize a 2D table of booleans, dp, with False values.
    2. Iterate over each element (i, j) in the subtable.
        - For each element, check if it's less than or equal to its adjacent elements in the same column.
        - If it is, update the state dp[i][j] to True; otherwise, set it to False.
    3. Iterate over each task (l, r).
        - Check if all columns from lth row to rth row are sorted up to each element by checking dp[r][j] for j = 1 to m.
        - If any column is not sorted, set the result for that task to False; otherwise, set it to True.
