===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider grouping rows together based on their common columns. If two rows have the same values for a certain set of columns, then you can sort these rows independently without considering other columns.

Define the state as a tuple (col, max_val) where col is the column being checked and max_val is the maximum value seen in that column so far

State: (col, rows), Transition: (new_col, new_rows) -> check if sorted for new_cols

Memoization using Dynamic Programming:
    Implement a recursive function that calculates the result for each subproblem and stores it in a cache dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

    For each task l to r:
        Initialize dp array with default value "No"
        For each column c from 1 to m:
            For each row i from l to r:
                Update state (c, max_val) using current row
                If the subtable is sorted in non-decreasing order for this column and range, set dp[i] = "Yes"

    Check if any row in the range has the result as "Yes"
    Return "Yes" if at least one row has the result as "Yes", else return "No"
