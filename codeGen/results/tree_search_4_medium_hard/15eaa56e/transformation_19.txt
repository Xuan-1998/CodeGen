===BEGIN PLAN===
To find the smallest subproblem that can be solved optimally by considering a single column at a time. You could consider iterating over each element in the table, and checking if it's less than or equal to its adjacent elements in the same column.

The state expression could be an integer representing the maximum value in the subtable up to each element, with the initial state being 0 for all elements. The base case would be when the subtable consists of only one row, in which case the maximum value is simply the maximum value in that row.

Create a tabulation array where each cell represents whether the subtable up to that element is sorted in non-decreasing order.

For each task (l, r), iterate over each column and check if the subtable from l to r in that column is sorted. If it is, update the maximum value accordingly.

To improve this plan, we can use a more efficient data structure like a binary search tree or a heap to store the elements of each row. This would allow us to efficiently find the maximum value and check if the subtable is sorted.

The potential issues with the plan are that it may not be efficient for large inputs, and it does not handle edge cases such as an empty table.

To include edge cases, we can add a check at the beginning of the program to return "No" if the input table is empty.
