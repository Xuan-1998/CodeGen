===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider grouping rows together based on their common columns. If two rows have the same values for a certain set of columns, then you can sort these rows independently without considering other columns.

Define the state as a tuple (col, max_val) where col is the column being checked and max_val is the maximum value seen in that column so far

State: (col, max_val, prev_val), Transition: (new_col, new_max_val) -> update max_val and check if sorted based on previous value

For each task's subtable:
    1. Initialize an empty suffix array
    2. Iterate over the rows in reverse order
        a. For each row, find its column values for the current column
        b. If the row is a new combination of values seen so far, add it to the suffix array and update the max_val
        c. Check if the suffix array is sorted (i.e., all elements are in non-decreasing order)
    3. If any subtable has a sorted suffix array, print "Yes"
    4. Otherwise, print "No"
