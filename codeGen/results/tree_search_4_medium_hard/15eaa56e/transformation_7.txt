===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify if a row is sorted, check if all elements in the row are the same. If not, iterate through the row to find the first pair of adjacent elements that violate the sorting order. This will help you determine which column to focus on for further optimization.

The state expression is a tuple containing the maximum value and the count of non-decreasing elements in the subtable up to the current row. The base case is when the subtable has only one row, where the maximum value is the single element and the count is 1.

Consider a state where you store the count of non-decreasing elements in a column up to the current row. The transition relationship would be updating this count for each element in the subtable.

The dynamic programming table will have dimensions n*m*k, where n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, and k is the number of tasks. Each cell in the table will store the maximum value and the count of non-decreasing elements in a column up to the current row and task.

Initialize the dynamic programming table with the base case values. Then, for each task, iterate through the subtable and update the dynamic programming table based on the transition relationship.

To determine if the subtable is sorted in at least one column, check the last cell in the dynamic programming table. If the count of non-decreasing elements is greater than 0, then the subtable is sorted in at least one column; otherwise, it's not.
