===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify if a row is sorted, check if all elements in the row are the same. If not, iterate through the row to find the first pair of adjacent elements that violate the sorting order. This will help you determine which column to focus on for further optimization.

The state expression is a boolean indicating whether the subtable up to the current row is sorted in at least one column. The base case is when the subtable has only one row, which can be easily checked by comparing adjacent elements.

The state represents whether the current column is sorted in non-decreasing order. The transition relationship is that if the current column is sorted up to the current row, then it will remain so for all rows above this one. If the current column is not sorted up to the current row, then we have to check each of the previous columns to see which one was not sorted.

Create a 2D table where dp[i][j] represents whether the subtable from (1, 1) to (i, j) is sorted in at least one column. The initial state for all cells is False, assuming that the subtable has no rows or columns initially.

For each cell (i, j), if the current row [i][j-1] and [i][j] are not equal, then check if there is a previous column k such that dp[i-1][k] is True. This means that the subtable up to (i-1, k) was sorted in at least one column, and since the current row [i][j] is out of order with respect to [i][j-1], then this column k must have been the last column where the sorting order was maintained.

Update dp[i][j] to True if such a previous column exists. Otherwise, update it to False.

Finally, initialize the answer variable and iterate through all cells in the 2D table. For each cell (i, j), if dp[i][j] is True, then set the answer to "Yes". If the loop ends without finding any True value for dp[i][j], then set the answer to "No".

The time complexity of this plan is O(n*m) and the space complexity is also O(n*m). The plan handles edge cases by initializing all cells in the 2D table to False.
