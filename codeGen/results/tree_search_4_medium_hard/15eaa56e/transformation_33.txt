===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider grouping rows together based on their common columns. If two rows have the same values for a certain set of columns, then you can sort these rows independently without considering other columns.

Define the state as a tuple (col, max_val) where col is the column being checked and max_val is the maximum value seen in that column so far
State: (col, max_val), Transition: (new_col, new_rows) -> check if sorted for new_cols

Dynamically Create an Array of Arrays with Sort Function:
    Initialize a 2D array dp where each cell represents the result for the corresponding column
    Iterate over all columns and for each column, iterate over all rows and check if the current row is sorted based on the maximum value seen so far
        If it's not sorted, mark as False in the dp array; otherwise, mark as True

Check if any column has at least one "True" to determine if there's at least one task with a subtable that's sorted in non-decreasing order
