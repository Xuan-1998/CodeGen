===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify if a subtable is sorted in at least one column, iterate through each row and check for sorting in each column. For each column, compare adjacent elements starting from the first element to the last element. If all elements are the same or the subtable has only one element, consider it as sorted.
The state expression is a boolean indicating whether the subtable up to the current row is sorted in at least one column. The base case is when the subtable has only one row, which can be easily checked (True).
The state represents whether the subtable up to the current row is sorted in at least one column. The transition relationship is that if the current row is not sorted in any column, then the state remains unchanged; otherwise, it becomes True.
To optimize the sorting check for each column, consider memoizing the results of these checks based on previous rows and columns. This reduces redundant computations and improves performance.
