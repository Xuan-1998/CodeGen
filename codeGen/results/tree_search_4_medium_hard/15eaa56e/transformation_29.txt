===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider grouping rows together based on their common columns. If two rows have the same values for a certain set of columns, then you can sort these rows independently without considering other columns.

The state is a pair (i, j) representing the current row i and column j to check for sorting

Let's define dp[i][j] as True if the subtable from column 1 to j and rows 1 to i is sorted in non-decreasing order, False otherwise. 

Here are the steps:

*   Initialize dp[][] with all values set to False
*   Iterate over each task (l, r)
    *   For each row in this task, check if the subtable for that row is sorted in non-decreasing order for every column up to the current one.
    *   Update dp[r][j] as True if this row's subtable is sorted
*   Finally, return "Yes" if dp[n][m-1] is True, and "No" otherwise

This plan seems correct. It correctly captures the dynamic programming state and transition relation.

However, there might be a potential issue with edge cases. For example, what happens if the input contains very large numbers? The current plan does not seem to handle this case well, as it would have to sort all these rows for every task, which could take a long time or even run out of memory for very large inputs.

One way to improve this plan is by optimizing the dynamic programming state and transition relation. For instance, you might be able to avoid sorting each row in its entirety if you only need to check if it's sorted up to a certain point. This would significantly reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm.

Another way to improve the plan is by handling edge cases better. For example, you could handle very large inputs by splitting them into smaller subproblems and solving these subproblems recursively or iteratively.
