===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider grouping rows together based on their common columns. If two rows have the same values for a certain set of columns, then you can sort these rows independently without considering other columns.

The state is the entire table up to the current row i and column j, and the base case is when all rows have been processed

State: a tuple (rows, cols) representing the current subtable where rows is a list of lists and cols is the set of column indices that have not been fully processed yet. Transition: update the state by incrementing the index of the last row in 'rows' if it has been fully processed.

Iterate through the columns directly and keep track of the maximum column index for which the subtable is still unsorted.

For each task, check if the subtable is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, return "No".

Finally, iterate through all tasks and return "Yes" if at least one subtable is found to be sorted.
