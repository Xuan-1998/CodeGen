===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider grouping rows together based on their common columns. If two rows have the same values for a certain set of columns, then you can sort these rows independently without considering other columns.

The state is the entire table up to the current row i and column j, and the base case is when all rows have been processed

State: a dictionary where keys are column indices and values are sorted lists of elements from that column up to the current row i. The base case is when all rows have been processed.

Transition: update the state by adding a new element to each list corresponding to the columns in the new row, then sort these lists. This can be done using dynamic programming with memoization to avoid recomputation of subproblems

Memoize key function calls based on previous computations using a dictionary to store intermediate results

Check if the last k tasks are sorted by comparing their values. If they are, then return "Yes", otherwise return "No".
