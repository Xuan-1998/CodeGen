===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider grouping rows together based on their common columns. If two rows have the same values for a certain set of columns, then you can sort these rows independently without considering other columns.

The state is a pair (i, c) representing the current row i and column j to check for sorting

The dynamic programming approach involves defining the state as a tuple (i, c) where i is the current row index and c is the current column index. The goal is to check if the subtable from row l to r and column 1 to c is sorted in non-decreasing order.

The transition relationship can be defined as: dp[(i, c)] = True if the current column c is sorted in non-decreasing order from row l to i, False otherwise.

Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming state, where dp[i][c] represents whether the subtable up to row i and column c is sorted.

For each task (l, r), check if there exists at least one column c such that dp[r][c] = True. If yes, return "Yes". Otherwise, return "No".

This plan is correct in terms of identifying the dynamic programming approach and defining the state. It can be improved by considering edge cases, for example, what happens when l=1 and r=n? Also, the plan does not mention how to initialize the dp array.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
