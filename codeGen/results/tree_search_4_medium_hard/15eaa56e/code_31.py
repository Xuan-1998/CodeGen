In this code, we first initialize the dp_table with all -1s. Then, we iterate over each column and check for any duplicate rows in that column. If there are no duplicate rows, we update the dp_table according to whether the current row is sorted or not. Finally, we iterate over tasks and check if the subtable is sorted by comparing adjacent elements.

This solution works because it considers all possible combinations of sorted columns and checks if a given task can be sorted in non-decreasing order in at least one column.
