===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider grouping rows together based on their common columns. If two rows have the same values for a certain set of columns, then you can sort these rows independently without considering other columns.

Define the state as a tuple (col, max_val) where col is the column being checked and max_val is the maximum value seen in that column so far

State: (col, max_val), Transition: (new_col) -> check if sorted based on previous value
Create a 1D array dp where each cell dp[i] represents whether the ith row has a value greater than or equal to its previous row.
Iterate over all tasks and for each task, iterate over all columns. For each column, update the maximum value seen so far and check if sorted based on previous values.

===END PLAN===
