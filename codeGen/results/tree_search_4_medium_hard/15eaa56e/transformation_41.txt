===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider grouping rows together based on their common columns. If two rows have the same values for a certain set of columns, then you can sort these rows independently without considering other columns.

State: a tuple (rows, cols) representing the current subtable where rows is a list of lists and cols is the set of column indices that have not been fully processed yet.
Transition: update the state by incrementing the index of the last row in 'rows' if it has been fully processed.

Apply memoization using a dictionary where the key is the state (rows, cols) and the value is a boolean indicating whether the subtable is sorted. For each task (l, r), check if there exists at least one column that has all rows from l to r in non-decreasing order by checking the memoized result for the previous row. If it does, return "Yes". Otherwise, continue processing the remaining rows and columns.

===END PLAN===
