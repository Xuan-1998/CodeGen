===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The state expression is whether the subtable is sorted up to each element in the table. We iterate over each row and column, checking if all elements in that row are less than or equal to their previous elements.

State: dp[(i,j)] = whether the column is sorted up to element (i,j);
Transition:
  - If all elements in row l are less than or equal to their previous elements in the same column, then dp[(i,j)] = True;
  - Otherwise, dp[(i,j)] = False;

Base case: When the subtable consists of only one row, it's always sorted (True).

To avoid redundant computations, we can use memoization. We create a recursive function that takes the current position (i, j) and returns whether the column is sorted up to that element.

We iterate over each task and for each task, we check if the subtable is sorted in at least one column by iterating over each column and checking if the column is sorted up to the last element. If it is, then we return "Yes", otherwise we return "No".
