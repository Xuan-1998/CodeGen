===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with tabulation.

State: dp[i][j] = True if the subtable for the ith row and jth column is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise False.

Base Case: When i == 1 (or r), we only need to consider one row. In this case, dp[i][j] = True because there's no element less than the first one in that row.

Transition: For each cell dp[i][j], we can calculate whether it's sorted by checking if all elements from l to r are non-decreasing in the jth column. If they are, then dp[i][j] = True; otherwise False.

Dynamic Programming Algorithm:
1. Create a 2D table dp of size n * m and initialize it with False.
2. Iterate over each cell dp[i][j] in the table.
3. For each cell, check if all elements from l to r are non-decreasing in the jth column.
4. If they are, then set dp[i][j] = True; otherwise False.
5. Return "Yes" if there's at least one cell with dp[i][j] = True; otherwise "No".

This plan should correctly solve the problem and handle all edge cases. It does not include any unnecessary steps or transitions that could lead to incorrect solutions.
