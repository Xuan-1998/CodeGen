===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify if a row is sorted, check if all elements in the row are the same. If not, iterate through the row to find the first pair of adjacent elements that violate the sorting order. This will help you determine which column to focus on for further optimization.

The state expression is a dictionary mapping each column index to a boolean indicating whether the subtable up to the current row is sorted in that column. The base case is when the subtable has only one row, where all columns are considered sorted.

For each task (l, r), iterate through each column and check if the subtable is sorted in non-decreasing order from l to r. If a column is not sorted, break out of the loop and return "No". If the loop completes for all columns without finding a non-sorted one, return "Yes".
