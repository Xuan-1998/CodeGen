===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify if a row is sorted, check if all elements in the row are the same. If not, iterate through the row to find the first pair of adjacent elements that violate the sorting order. This will help you determine which column to focus on for further optimization.

The state expression is a tuple containing the maximum value and the count of non-decreasing elements in the subtable up to the current row. The base case is when the subtable has only one row, where the maximum value is the single element and the count is 1.

Consider a state where you store the count of non-decreasing elements in a column up to the current row. The transition relationship would be updating this count for each element in the subtable.

Iterate over the table and maintain a dynamic programming table where the state at each cell represents whether the column up to that point is non-decreasing. The transition relationship would be updating this state for each element in the subtable.

For each task, check if the dynamic programming table indicates that the column is non-decreasing from row l to r. If it does, return "Yes". Otherwise, continue checking tasks until all tasks have been checked, then return "No".

This plan handles edge cases by considering the base case where the subtable has only one row.

The plan correctly identifies whether a column up to a certain point is non-decreasing, which can be used to determine if the entire column is sorted.

However, this plan does not handle the optimization part of identifying which column is sorted. It would be more efficient to focus on columns where the first element in each task's subtable is greater than the last element in the previous task's subtable.

The updated version of the plan:
