===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to determine if each subtable is sorted in non-decreasing order. Here's an updated and detailed plan:
===
dp[(i, j)] = whether the column is sorted up to element (i, j); 
Transition: 
    * Initialize dp[(0, 0)] = True; // base case for a table with only one row
    * For each subtable from (1, 0) to (n - 1, m - 1):
        + If all elements in the current row are less than or equal to their previous elements in the same column:
            - dp[(i, j)] = dp[(i - 1, j)] // continue the sorted subtable
        + Otherwise: 
            - dp[(i, j)] = False; // the subtable is not sorted
    * For each task (l, r):
        + Check if all elements in rows from l to r are less than or equal to their previous elements in the same column.
        + If they are, print "Yes"; Otherwise, print "No";
