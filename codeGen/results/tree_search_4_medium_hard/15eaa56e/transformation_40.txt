===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider grouping rows together based on their common columns. If two rows have the same values for a certain set of columns, then you can sort these rows independently without considering other columns.

State: a tuple (rows, cols) representing the current subtable where rows is a list of lists and cols is the set of column indices that have not been fully processed yet.
Transition: update the state by incrementing the index of the last row in 'rows' if it has been fully processed.
Use a 2D DP table dp[m][n] to store the sorted status of each subtable where m represents the number of rows and n represents the number of columns.
dp[i][j] is True if the subtable from (0,0) to (i,j) is sorted in non-decreasing order.

State: a tuple (rows, cols) representing the current subtable where rows is a list of lists and cols is the set of column indices that have not been fully processed yet.
Transition: update the state by incrementing the index of the last row in 'rows' if it has been fully processed.
The base case is when all rows have been processed, then dp[n-1][m-1] represents whether the entire table is sorted.

Initialize a variable res to False and iterate through the DP table starting from (0,0).
If for any column j, there exists a row i such that dp[i][j] is True, set res to True.
Return "Yes" if res is True else return "No".
