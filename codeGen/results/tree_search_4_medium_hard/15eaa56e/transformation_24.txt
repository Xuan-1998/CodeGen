This plan seems correct and should work efficiently to solve the problem. The hashmap helps to avoid recomputation of the same subproblem multiple times, which can significantly improve the performance of the solution.

The plan includes edge cases such as when the subtable consists of only one row or column, in which case it's always sorted. It also considers all columns when checking if the subtable is sorted along each column.

Overall, this plan seems to be a good approach to solving the problem and should work efficiently and correctly.
