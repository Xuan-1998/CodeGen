===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider grouping rows together based on their common columns. If two rows have the same values for a certain set of columns, then you can sort these rows independently without considering other columns.

State: a dictionary where keys are column indices and values are lists of elements from that column up to the current row i. The state also includes an additional value, which is "sorted" if all the elements in the list are sorted in non-decreasing order.
The base case is when i equals n, where n is the number of rows.

Transition: update the state by adding a new element to each list corresponding to the columns in the new row i+1. Then, for each column j, check if all the elements in the list are sorted in non-decreasing order and mark the state as "sorted" if they are. If any column is not sorted, mark the entire state as not sorted.

To solve the problem, iterate over each task (l, r) and for each task, check if the subtable is sorted by checking the state at row r and column j where j is the minimum index in the task. If the state is "sorted", then return "Yes". Otherwise, continue to the next task.

If no task returns "Yes" after processing all tasks, return "No".
