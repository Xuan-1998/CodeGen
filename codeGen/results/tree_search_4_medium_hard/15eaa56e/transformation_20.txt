===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with memoization. The main idea is to iterate over each element in the table and check if it's less than or equal to its adjacent elements in the same column.

The state expression could be a dictionary where each key-value pair corresponds to the maximum value up to a certain element, and the value is whether the subtable up to that element is sorted. The initial state would be {0: 0} for all elements, indicating that the subtable up to the first element is always sorted.

The base case would be when the subtable consists of only one row, in which case the maximum value is simply the maximum value in that row. We can use this base case to initialize our dynamic programming table.

To fill up the dynamic programming table, we iterate over each element in the table and check if it's less than or equal to its adjacent elements in the same column. If it is, then the subtable up to that element is sorted, so we update the corresponding value in the dictionary accordingly. Otherwise, the subtable up to that element may not be sorted.

Finally, we can use this dynamic programming table to determine if any of the subtables are sorted in non-decreasing order. We simply iterate over each task and check if the corresponding subtable is sorted using our dynamic programming table. If it is, then we return "Yes", otherwise we return "No".

This plan seems correct, but it may not be efficient because we're checking every element in the table. A more efficient approach would be to only consider elements that have changed since the last task.
