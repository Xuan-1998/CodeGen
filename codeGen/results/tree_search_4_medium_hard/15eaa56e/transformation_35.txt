===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider grouping rows together based on their common columns. If two rows have the same values for a certain set of columns, then you can sort these rows independently without considering other columns.

Define the state as a tuple (col, max_val, is_sorted) where col is the column being checked, max_val is the maximum value seen in that column so far, and is_sorted is a boolean indicating whether the column is sorted or not

State: (col, max_val, is_sorted), Transition: (new_row, new_max_val, new_is_sorted) -> update max_val, check if sorted, and set is_sorted accordingly

Create a dictionary to store the maximum values seen for each column. Iterate over each row in the subtable, update the maximum value for each column, and store it in the dictionary.

Final step: Iterate over the columns and check if any of them are sorted in non-decreasing order.
    If all columns are sorted, then return "Yes". Otherwise, return "No".
