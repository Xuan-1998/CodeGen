===BEGIN PLAN===
To find the smallest subproblem that can be solved optimally by considering a single column at a time. You could consider iterating over each element in the table, and checking if it's less than or equal to its adjacent elements in the same column.

The state expression could be a boolean indicating whether the subtable is sorted up to each element, with the initial state being False for all elements. The base case would be when the subtable consists of only one row, in which case it's always True.

State: dp[i][j] = whether the column is sorted up to element (i,j); Transition: 
dp[i][j] = True if (all elements in row i are less than or equal to their previous elements in the same column) and (the same holds true for all rows above); Otherwise, dp[i][j] = False;

Use a 2D array with dynamic programming to store the state of each cell (dp[i][j]) and update it recursively. For each element in the table, iterate over its adjacent elements in the same column to check if they are less than or equal to the current element.

If all adjacent elements are less than or equal to the current element, then mark this column as sorted up to this element by setting dp[i][j] = True; If any adjacent element is greater than the current element, then mark this column as unsorted up to this element by setting dp[i][j] = False;

Once all elements in the table are processed, iterate over each task and check if the subtable is sorted in at least one column. For each task (l,r), check dp[l-1][j] and dp[r][j] for any j; If there exists a j such that both conditions hold true, then return "Yes"; Otherwise, return "No".
