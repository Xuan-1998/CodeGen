===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider grouping rows together based on their common columns. If two rows have the same values for a certain set of columns, then you can sort these rows independently without considering other columns.

Define the state as a tuple (col, max_val) where col is the column being checked and max_val is the maximum value seen in that column so far

State: (rows, max_val), Transition: (new_row, new_max_val) -> update max_val and check if sorted
Create a 2D table to store the maximum value seen in each column for each row. The state will be the current column and the previous maximum value.

For each task, iterate over all columns:
    - Iterate through rows l to r
        - Update max_val if necessary
        - Check if subtable is sorted by comparing each element with its predecessor

Check if any of the k tasks find a sorted subtable. If yes, return "Yes". Otherwise, return "No".
