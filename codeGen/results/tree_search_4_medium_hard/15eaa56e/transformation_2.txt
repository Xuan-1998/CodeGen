===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify if a row is sorted, check if all elements in the row are the same. If not, iterate through the row to find the first pair of adjacent elements that violate the sorting order. This will help you determine which column to focus on for further optimization.

The state expression is a boolean indicating whether the subtable up to the current row is sorted in at least one column. The base case is when the subtable has only one row, which can be easily checked.

The state represents whether the current column is sorted in non-decreasing order. The transition relationship is that if the current column is sorted up to the current row, then it will remain so for all rows above this one. If the current column is not sorted up to the current row, then we have to check each of the previous columns to see which one was not sorted.

Implement dynamic programming using a bottom-up approach where you fill up the dp table based on the values of smaller subproblems. For each cell in the dp table, iterate through all possible previous states and update the state accordingly.

Initialize the dp table with all false values (assuming the original problem statement does not specify anything about the initial state).

The plan is correct for identifying whether a row is sorted or not. However, it may not be effective in terms of time complexity as it checks each pair of adjacent elements in every row.

A possible improvement could be to use a more efficient algorithm to check if a row is sorted, such as checking if the first element of the row is less than or equal to all other elements.

Another potential issue with this plan is that it does not consider edge cases. For example, what if the table contains only one column? In this case, the problem becomes trivial and the plan may not be able to handle it correctly.

The updated version of the plan should include these improvements and edge cases.
