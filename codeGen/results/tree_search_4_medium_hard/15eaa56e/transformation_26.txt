===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider grouping rows together based on their common columns. If two rows have the same values for a certain set of columns, then you can sort these rows independently without considering other columns.

The state is a pair (i, j) representing the current row i and column j to check for sorting

The dynamic programming approach involves defining the state as a tuple (i, c) where i is the current row index and c is the current column index. The goal is to check if the subtable from row l to r and column 1 to c is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Define a function to calculate the next state based on the current state:

- If the current column c is sorted in non-decreasing order from row l to i, then mark dp[(i, c)] as True.
- Otherwise, mark dp[(i, c)] as False.

Use memoization to store the results of previously computed states.

The base case would be when i = r. In this case, return dp[(r, c)]

The main function would iterate over all tasks and check if any column is sorted in non-decreasing order from row l to r for each task. If it finds such a column, return "Yes". Otherwise, return "No".

This plan seems correct but can be improved by using a more efficient data structure like a prefix sum array to store the cumulative sum of elements in each column and then calculate the next state based on this prefix sum.

The potential issues with this plan are that it may not handle edge cases correctly. For example, what if l > r? This could potentially lead to incorrect results.

To improve this plan, one can use a more efficient data structure like a prefix sum array to store the cumulative sum of elements in each column and then calculate the next state based on this prefix sum.

Here is an updated version of the entire detailed plan:
