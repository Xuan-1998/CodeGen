===BEGIN PLAN===
To identify if a row is sorted, check if all elements in the row are the same. If not, iterate through the row to find the first pair of adjacent elements that violate the sorting order. This will help you determine which column to focus on for further optimization.

The state expression is a boolean indicating whether the subtable up to the current row is sorted in at least one column. The base case is when the subtable has only one row, which can be easily checked.

The state represents whether the subtable up to the current row is sorted in at least one column. The transition relationship is that if the current row is not sorted in any column, then the state remains unchanged; otherwise, it becomes True.

Using a dynamic programming table to keep track of the state for each row and column.
For each row r and column c:
    - Initialize dp[r][c] to False
    - For each element e at position (r, c):
        - If all elements in the current row are the same, set dp[r][c] to True
        - Otherwise, iterate through the row to find the first pair of adjacent elements that violate the sorting order. If such a pair is found, set dp[r][c] to True

To determine if the subtable is sorted in at least one column, simply check dp[n-1][-1]
