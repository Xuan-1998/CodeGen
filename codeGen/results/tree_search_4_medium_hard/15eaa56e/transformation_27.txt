===BEGIN PLAN===
The state is a pair (i, j) representing the current row i and column j to check for sorting
Create a dictionary dp with default value False to store the dynamic programming states
For each task (l, r):
    For each column c:
        Calculate the maximum value in the subtable from row l to i and column 1 to c
        Check if the subtable is sorted by comparing adjacent elements
        If it's sorted, update dp[(i, c)] = True
For each task (l, r):
    Check if there exists a column c such that dp[(r, c)] = True
If yes, print "Yes", otherwise print "No"
