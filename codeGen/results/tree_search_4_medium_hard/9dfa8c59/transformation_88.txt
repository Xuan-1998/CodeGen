===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop an iterative solution by generating all prime numbers up to n_max, then checking the number of permutations for each one.
The state is a boolean indicating whether the current prime number has exactly k_perms permutations, with no additional information.

1. Generate all prime numbers up to n_max using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm
2. Initialize an empty dictionary dp to store the results of permutation counting for each prime number
3. For each prime number p in the range [2, n_max]:
    a. Calculate the factorial of p
    b. Divide the factorial by the product of its digits' factorials
    c. Compare this value with k_perms
    d. If the result is equal to k_perms, mark the corresponding boolean as True in dp
4. Initialize counters for the count, smallest, and largest prime numbers with exactly k_perms permutations
5. Iterate through dp again, and for each prime number p:
    a. If the corresponding boolean in dp is True:
        i. Increment the count counter
        ii. Update the smallest and largest prime numbers if necessary
