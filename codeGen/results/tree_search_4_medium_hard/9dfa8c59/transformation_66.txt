===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop an iterative solution by generating all prime numbers up to n_max, then checking the number of permutations for each one.

State: (n, k_perms_count) where n is the current prime number and k_perms_count is the count of its permutations that are less than or equal to k_perms.
    Initialize an empty dictionary dp with keys as prime numbers and values as 0.

Iterate through all primes up to n_max:
    For each prime p, generate its permutations using a set (unique elements).
    Count the number of unique permutations that are less than or equal to k_perms and store it in dp[p].

Tabulate the number of permutations for each prime number using a dictionary.
    Initialize variables: count_of_prime_numbers_with_k_perms = 0, smallest_prime = float('inf'), largest_prime = -float('inf')

Iterate through all primes up to n_max:
    If p has k_perms or fewer unique permutations and is less than or equal to n_max:
        Increment count_of_prime_numbers_with_k_perms.
        Update smallest_prime and largest_prime if necessary.

Return the values: [count_of_prime_numbers_with_k_perms, smallest_prime, largest_prime]
