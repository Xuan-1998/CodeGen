===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers and their corresponding permutations count. 
Iterate over each number below n_max and for each number, generate all its permutations (by rearranging its digits) and check if they are prime. 
Count the number of prime permutations for each number. 
The base case would be when num = 2, as there's only one permutation for the smallest prime number, which is itself. 
Implement bottom-up dynamic programming by iteratively updating a table with the count of prime numbers that have exactly k_perms prime permutations below n_max. 
For each number below n_max, check if it has k_perms prime permutations and update the table accordingly.
Finally, return the count of such prime numbers, the smallest and largest prime numbers among them.
