===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop an iterative solution by generating all prime numbers up to n_max, then checking the number of permutations for each one.
The state is a boolean indicating whether the current prime number has exactly k_perms permutations, with no additional information.

1. Use a sieve algorithm (e.g., Sieve of Eratosthenes) to generate all prime numbers up to n_max in O(n_max log(log n_max)) time complexity.
2. Initialize an empty list to store the count of prime numbers with k_perms permutations and their corresponding smallest and largest values.
3. Iterate through each prime number p in the sieve:
   a. Generate all permutations of p using a recursive algorithm (e.g., generate_permutations function).
   b. Count the number of permutations that have exactly k_perms digits by iterating through the permutations and checking if they meet the condition.
   c. If the count is greater than 0, add the prime number to the list along with its smallest and largest values.
4. Return the list containing the count of prime numbers with k_perms permutations, their smallest value, and their largest value.
