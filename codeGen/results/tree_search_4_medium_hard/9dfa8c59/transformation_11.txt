===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a set to store prime numbers and memoize the count of permutations by storing the results in a dictionary.
The base case would be when num = 2, as there's only one permutation for the smallest prime number, which is itself.

Create an empty set prime_numbers to store prime numbers.
Iterate over each number from 2 to n_max-1:
   - Check if the number is prime by iterating from 2 to sqrt(num) and checking if it has any divisors. If not, add it to the set prime_numbers.
   
Create a dictionary permutations_count to store the count of permutations for each prime number. Initialize it with all values as 0.

Iterate over each prime number in prime_numbers:
   - For each prime number, generate its permutations by iterating over the digits and rearranging them.
   - Count the number of unique permutations for the current prime number and update the value in the dictionary permutations_count.

Find the count of prime numbers with k_perms prime permutations below n_max by iterating over the values in the dictionary permutations_count.
Find the smallest and largest prime numbers among those with k_perms prime permutations.

Return [count, smallest_prime, largest_prime].
