===BEGIN PLAN===
Code:
1. Initialize a table dp with size n_max+1
2. Iterate from 2 to n_max (inclusive)
    2.1 Check if current number is prime and has k_perms permutations
        2.1.1 If not, update the table accordingly
    2.2 Update the smallest and largest prime numbers found so far
3. Return [count of prime numbers with k_perms permutations below n_max, smallest prime number, largest prime number]
===END PLAN===
