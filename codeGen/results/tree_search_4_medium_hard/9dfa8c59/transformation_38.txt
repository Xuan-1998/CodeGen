===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers and their corresponding permutations, then iterate over each number below n_max to count the number of primes with k_perms permutations.

Base case: When input number is less than or equal to 1, return [0, 0, 0] as there are no prime numbers with k_perms permutations.

Store prime numbers in a set and iterate over each number below n_max. For each number:
    Generate all possible permutations of the digits.
    Check if the generated permutations are prime numbers.
    If the count of prime permutations is equal to k_perms, increment the count of primes with k_perms permutations.
    
Store the smallest and largest prime numbers in variables min_prime and max_prime.

Return [count_of_primes, min_prime, max_prime].
