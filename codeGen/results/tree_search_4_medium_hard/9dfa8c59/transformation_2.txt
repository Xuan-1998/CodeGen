===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers below n_max and iterate over each number in the range [2, n_max] to count its permutations.

Let the state be a tuple (num, k) where num is a prime number and k is the count of its permutations that are also prime numbers. Initialize a dynamic programming table dp with size n_max + 1 where dp[i] represents the count of prime numbers below i that have exactly k prime permutations.

Iterate over each prime number in the range [2, n_max]. For each prime number num, iterate over all possible permutations of its digits and check if they are also prime numbers. If a permutation is prime, increment the count for that prime number in dp table.

Finally, return the count of prime numbers with exactly k prime permutations below n_max (dp[k]), along with the smallest and largest prime numbers among them.
