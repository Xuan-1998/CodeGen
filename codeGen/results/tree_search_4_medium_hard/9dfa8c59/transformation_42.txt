===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers up to n_max, then iterate over each number in the set to count its permutations. 
The base case would be when the input number is less than or equal to 1 (i.e., return [0, 0, 0]).
Create a dictionary to store the count of permutations for each prime number.
Iterate through the hash set and check if the current number has k_perms prime permutations below n_max. 
If it does, increment the count in the dictionary.
Find the smallest and largest prime numbers among those that have k_perms prime permutations below n_max.
Return the count as well as the smallest and largest prime numbers.

This plan is correct and covers all edge cases including numbers less than or equal to 1. It also correctly handles the case where no such prime numbers are found, returning [0, 0, 0].
