===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop an iterative solution by generating all prime numbers up to n_max, then checking the number of permutations for each one.
The state is a tuple (n, k_perms_count) where n is the current prime number and k_perms_count is the count of its permutations that are less than or equal to k_perms.
The transition relationship is defined as: if the number of permutations for i is less than or equal to k_perms, then increment k_perms_count. 
Implement a dynamic programming table with a nested dictionary, where the keys are prime numbers and the values are dictionaries containing counts of permutations.
Store the smallest and largest prime numbers that meet the condition in separate variables.
Initialize the count of such prime numbers to 0.
Iterate through all prime numbers up to n_max:
    Check if the number of permutations for each prime is less than or equal to k_perms. 
    If true, increment the count, update the smallest and largest prime numbers if necessary, and update the DP table accordingly.
Return a list containing the count, the smallest prime number, and the largest prime number.
