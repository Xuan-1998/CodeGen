===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop an iterative solution by generating all prime numbers up to n_max, then checking the number of permutations for each one.

The state is a tuple (n, k_perms_count) where n is the current prime number and k_perms_count is the count of its permutations that are less than or equal to k_perms.
The transition relationship is checking if the number of permutations for i is less than or equal to k_perms. If it is, increment the state's value; otherwise, break out of the loop.

To improve the plan:

* Instead of generating all prime numbers up to n_max and then checking their permutations, consider generating only those prime numbers that have exactly k_perms permutations below n_max.
* To optimize the permutation counting process, use a set data structure to store unique permutations for each prime number. This way, you can quickly check if a permutation already exists in the cache.

To address potential issues:

* The plan assumes that k_perms is a reasonable value (less than or equal to 3). If it's not, you might need to adjust the approach.
* Edge cases: Ensure that the solution handles n_max values close to or exceeding 10000 and k_perms values close to or equal to 3.
