===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers up to n_max. Then:
    Iterate over each number below n_max to count its permutations.
        For each number i, generate all possible permutations of its digits and check if they are prime.
        Store the count of such prime permutations in a 2D array dp[i][k_perms].
        Use dynamic programming with base case when input number is less than or equal to 1:
            dp[0][k] = 0 for any k
        Initialize variables: count, min_prime, max_prime
        Iterate over each number i below n_max:
            For each i, generate all possible permutations of its digits and check if they are prime.
            Count the number of such prime permutations that equals to k_perms.
            Update count, min_prime, max_prime accordingly.
    Return the count, min_prime, max_prime as the result.
