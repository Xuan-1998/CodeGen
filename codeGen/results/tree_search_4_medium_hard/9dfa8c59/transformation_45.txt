===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming with recursive function:
    - Function checks if number is prime and has k_perms permutations
    - Updates results as needed
State variable: (n, k) where n is current prime number and k is count of its prime permutations
Dictionary to store previously computed results
Recursive function pseudocode:
    def dp(n, k):
        # Base case: check if number is prime and has k_perms permutations
        if is_prime(n) and get_permutations(n) == k:
            return 1
        elif n > max_num:  # optimization for large numbers
            return 0
        else:
            # Recursive case: sum of counts from smaller numbers
            total = 0
            for i in range(10):  # iterate over digits 0-9
                new_n = int(str(n)[1:] + str(i))  # generate next number
                if dp(new_n, k) > 0:
                    total += 1
            return total

    def get_permutations(n):
        # count of permutations for a given prime number
        pass

    def is_prime(n):
        # check if a number is prime
        pass

    max_num = n_max  # initialize maximum number

dp(0, k_perms)  # start recursive function with initial values
