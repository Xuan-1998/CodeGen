===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming with recursive function that checks if a number is prime and has k_perms permutations:
1. Define state variable (n, k) where n is current number and k is count of its prime permutations, updated recursively.
2. Use dictionary to store intermediate results for memoization.
3. Check if n is prime; if not, return 0 as it does not have any prime permutations.
4. Initialize result for prime number n with initial state (n, 1).
5. For each digit d in the representation of n:
    a. Calculate the number of permutations by multiplying the current count k and the factorial of the remaining digits.
    b. If the calculated count is equal to k_perms, return (count of prime numbers with k_perms, smallest, largest).
6. Recursively call the function for each digit d until all digits are processed or a solution is found.
7. Return the final result.
