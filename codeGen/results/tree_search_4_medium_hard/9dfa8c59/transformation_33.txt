===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers up to n_max, then iterate over each number in the set to count its permutations.
Use memoization to store previously checked divisibility and prime status for each number below n_max.
Create a dictionary storing the count of permutations for each prime number, where the key is the prime number and the value is its permutation count.
Iterate over each prime number to determine if it has k_perms unique permutations by rearranging its digits and counting them.
Determine the smallest and largest such prime numbers among those found with k_perms permutations.
Return a list containing the count of such prime numbers, the smallest, and the largest.
===END PLAN===
