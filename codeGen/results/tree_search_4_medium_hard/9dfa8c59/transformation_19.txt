===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers, then iterate over each number below n_max to count its permutations.

Let the state be a boolean value indicating whether the current number is prime, and the base case would be when the number is less than 2.

Maintain two dynamic arrays dp1 and dp2 where:
dp1[i] represents whether i is a prime number
dp2[i] stores the count of permutations for the prime number i

Iterate over each number below n_max to fill up dp1 and dp2:

    For each number i, check if it's prime by iterating from 2 to sqrt(i) and checking if i is divisible.
    If not, mark i as a prime number in dp1.

    Then, calculate the permutations of i:
        Convert i to string
        Count the frequency of each digit using a dictionary
        Check if all frequencies are less than k_perms (i.e., the number has exactly k_perms unique digits)
        If yes, increment dp2[i]

Finally, count the prime numbers with exactly k_perms permutations by summing up the values in dp2.

Return the count of such prime numbers, the smallest and largest prime numbers among them. If no such prime numbers are found, return [0, 0, 0].
