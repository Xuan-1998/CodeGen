===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers, then iterate over each number below n_max to count its permutations.
Let the state be a boolean value indicating whether the current number is prime, and the base case would be when the number is less than 2.

Maintain two dictionaries: 
- one to store the count of permutations for each prime number (key being the number itself, and value being the count of permutations)
- another to store the smallest and largest prime numbers with k_perms prime permutations

Using a dynamic programming table to store the counts of prime permutations
Initialize the DP table with 0s, where the size is n_max + 1
Iterate over each number from 2 to n_max:
    Check if it's a prime number (state)
    If it's prime, iterate over its digits to count its permutations
    Update the permutation count dictionary and DP table accordingly

In the final iteration, iterate over the DP table from left to right:
    For each cell in the DP table, check if it equals k_perms
    If it does, update the smallest and largest prime numbers with k_perms prime permutations
Return the count of such prime numbers, the smallest and largest prime numbers among them
