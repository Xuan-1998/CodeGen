1. Develop an iterative solution by generating all prime numbers up to n_max:
    - Create a boolean array is_prime of size n_max+1 with all values initially set to true.
    - Iterate from 2 to sqrt(n_max):
        - For each number i, if is_prime[i] is true and i <= n_max/i, then mark as false all the multiples of i from i*i to n_max.
    - Find all prime numbers in the range [2, n_max) by iterating over the array is_prime.

2. Generate permutations for each prime number:
    - Define a recursive function generate_permutations(s, k, current):
        - If k == 0, return {1}.
        - Initialize an empty set permutations.
        - For each digit d from 0 to s-1:
            - Add the string concatenation of s and str(d) to permutations.
            - Recursively call generate_permutations(s-1, k-1, str(d)) and add its result to permutations.
        - Return permutations.

3. Check if a prime number has exactly k_perms permutations:
    - For each prime number p in the range [2, n_max), calculate its number of permutations by calling generate_permutations(len(str(p)), k, "").
    - If the calculated count is equal to k_perms, increment the count of primes with k_perms permutations.

4. Find the smallest and largest prime numbers:
    - Initialize min_prime and max_prime to 0.
    - For each prime number p in the range [2, n_max), if p has exactly k_perms permutations, update min_prime and max_prime accordingly.

5. Return the count, min_prime, and max_prime:
    - Return a list of [count_of_primes_with_k_perms, min_prime, max_prime].
