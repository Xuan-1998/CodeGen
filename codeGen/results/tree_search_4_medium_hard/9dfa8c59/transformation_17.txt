===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers up to n_max.
For each number below n_max:
  - Check if it's prime
  - If it is, calculate its permutations by sorting all possible digit arrangements and counting duplicates. 
    This can be done recursively or iteratively with memoization.
  - Count the number of prime permutations for this number.
Memoize the function that calculates the permutations count for each prime number.
===END PLAN===
