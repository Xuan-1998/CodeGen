===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with memoization. Here's an updated plan:

Think about a recursive function that checks if a number is prime and has k_perms permutations, updating the results as needed.

Base case: when n_max is less than or equal to 2, as prime numbers below this value have no more than one permutation.

To develop an iterative approach by iterating from n_max downwards, checking each number's primality and permutation count, and updating the results as needed. This can be done using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach:

Iterate from n_max downwards
For each number:
    Check if it's prime (use a sieve or trial division)
    Count its permutations by sorting all possible permutations of its digits
    If the number has k_perms permutations, update the results as needed

Memoize intermediate results in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations

When finished iterating, return the count of prime numbers with k_perms permutations, the smallest and largest among them
