===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about dynamic programming with a recursive function that checks if a number is prime and has k_perms permutations, updating the results as needed.

The state expression could be 'is_prime' for a given number, and the base case would be when the number of permutations equals k_perms. This base case can then be used to recursively check each permutation for k_perms.

State: {num, is_prime}: Whether the current number is prime
Memoize the result of checking if a number is prime, then recursively check each permutation for k_perms

Update:
The plan can be improved by considering that we don't need to check every permutation. We only need to check permutations where all digits are different, as these will have more than one unique arrangement.

The base case would still be when the number of permutations equals k_perms, but we would also keep track of the smallest and largest prime numbers seen so far.
