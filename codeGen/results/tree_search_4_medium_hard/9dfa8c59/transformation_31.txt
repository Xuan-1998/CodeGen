===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a dictionary storing the count of permutations for each prime number below n_max, where the key is the prime number and the value is its permutation count.

Iterate over each number from 2 to n_max, checking if it's prime. If it's prime:

    Store the prime number in a set.
    Use a recursive function with memoization to store the permutation counts for each prime number and its corresponding count of k_perms. The function should take three arguments: the current prime number, its index in the set, and the maximum number of permutations (k_perms).

    Within the recursive function:

        If the current prime number has fewer than k_perms unique permutations, increment the count of such prime numbers.
        If the current prime number's permutation count is equal to k_perms, store it as a candidate for the smallest and largest prime numbers.

    After processing all prime numbers, return the count of such prime numbers, the smallest candidate prime number, and the largest candidate prime number. If no such prime numbers are found, return [0, 0, 0].
