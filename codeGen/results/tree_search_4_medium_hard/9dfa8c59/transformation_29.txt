===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers below n_max. Then:
  - Create a dictionary storing the count of permutations for each prime number in the set, where the key is the prime number and the value is its permutation count.
  - Iterate over each number below n_max to check if it's prime. If it's not prime, skip it. If it's prime, calculate its permutation count using a recursive function (to be implemented).
  - Store the permutation counts in the dictionary.
  - Initialize counters for the total count of prime numbers with k_perms permutations, smallest and largest such prime numbers.
  - Iterate over the dictionary to find prime numbers with exactly k_perms permutations. For each such prime number:
    + Increment the total count.
    + Update the smallest and largest prime numbers if necessary.
  - Return a list containing the total count, the smallest prime number, and the largest prime number.
