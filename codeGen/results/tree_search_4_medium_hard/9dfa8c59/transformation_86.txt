===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop an iterative solution by generating all prime numbers up to n_max, then checking the number of permutations for each one.
The state is a boolean indicating whether the current prime number has exactly k_perms permutations, with no additional information.

View each prime number as a string and generate all its permutations using recursion or iteration. Then, check if the number of permutations is equal to k_perms.
Maintain an array dp of size n_max+1 where each element at index i stores the count of permutations of all prime numbers less than or equal to i.
Initialize dp with zeros.

For each prime p in the range [2, n_max]:
    Convert p to a string str_p.
    Generate all permutations of str_p using recursion or iteration. Let count be the number of unique permutations.
    Check if count equals k_perms. If true, increment the value at dp[p] by 1.

The answer is stored in the array dp: 
    The count of prime numbers with exactly k_perms permutations below n_max is dp[n_max].
    The smallest and largest such prime numbers are the first and last indices of non-zero elements in the array dp, respectively.
If no such prime numbers are found, return [0, 0, 0].
