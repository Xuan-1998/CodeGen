===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers below n_max. Then, for each number in the range [2, n_max), count its permutations by sorting its digits and checking if the resulting number is also in the hash set. This can be done efficiently using dynamic programming.
Let the state be a boolean value indicating whether the current number is prime, and the base case would be when the number is less than 2 (not prime).
Maintain a dictionary to store the count of permutations for each prime number, with its key being the number itself and value being the count of permutations below n_max.
Tabulate the number of permutations for each prime number by iterating over all numbers in the range [2, n_max) and updating the dictionary accordingly. This can be done using a loop that iterates over the numbers in the range [2, n_max).
Filter the dictionary to only include prime numbers with exactly k_perms permutations.
Return the count of such prime numbers, the smallest one, and the largest one.
