===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers, then iterate over each number below n_max to count its permutations.
The base case would be when the input number is less than or equal to 1.

To efficiently determine whether a number is prime, use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. This will allow us to generate all prime numbers up to n_max in O(n_max log log n_max) time complexity.

Once we have the list of prime numbers, iterate over each prime number and count its permutations by generating all possible permutations of its digits using a recursive function. Store the counts in a 2D array, where the rows represent the prime numbers and the columns represent the permutation counts from 1 to k_perms.

To improve the plan, consider storing the prime numbers and their permutation counts in a data structure that allows for efficient lookup, such as a hashmap or an ordered dictionary.

The potential issue with the plan is that it may not be efficient enough for large values of n_max. However, this can be mitigated by using more advanced algorithms for generating permutations and counting them.

The plan includes edge cases, such as handling prime numbers with fewer than k_perms permutations.
