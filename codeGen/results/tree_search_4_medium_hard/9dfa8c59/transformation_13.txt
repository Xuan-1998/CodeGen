===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers up to n_max and then iterate over each number in the set to count its permutations. The base case would be when num = 2, as there's only one permutation for the smallest prime number, which is itself.
Use memoization with a dictionary to store the count of permutations for each prime number. For each prime number, generate all possible permutations and check if they are also prime numbers. If k_perms number of permutations match, increment the count in the dictionary.
To avoid duplicate calculations, use a set to keep track of previously counted prime numbers and their corresponding permutation counts.
When iterating over each number below n_max, check if it's a prime number using the stored hash set. If it is, generate all possible permutations and check if they match k_perms. If they do, update the count in the dictionary.
Finally, return the total count of prime numbers with k_perms permutations, along with the smallest and largest such prime numbers.
