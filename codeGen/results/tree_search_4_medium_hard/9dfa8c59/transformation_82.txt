===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop an iterative solution by:
    * Generating all prime numbers up to n_max
    * Checking the number of permutations for each one using dynamic programming
The state is:
    * A boolean indicating whether the current prime number has exactly k_perms permutations
Consider using a sieve to generate all prime numbers up to n_max, then use a nested loop to count the number of permutations for each one by:
    * Tabulating the permutations for each prime number
    * Iterating over the digits of each prime number and checking if they can be rearranged into k_perms unique permutations
===END PLAN===
