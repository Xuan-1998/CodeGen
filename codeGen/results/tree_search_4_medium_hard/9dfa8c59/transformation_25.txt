===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers up to n_max. Then iterate over each number in the range [2, n_max] and count its permutations.
Let the state be a boolean value indicating whether the current number is prime, and the base case would be when the number is less than 2.
Maintain an array dp where dp[i] represents whether the number i is prime and has exactly k_perms prime permutations.
Utilize a memoization technique by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary and reusing them as needed.

For each prime number p, calculate the number of permutations that have exactly k_perms prime digits below p. If this count matches k_perms, mark dp[p] as True.

Finally, iterate over the range [2, n_max] again to find the smallest and largest prime numbers among those with k_perms prime permutations. Return a list containing the count, smallest, and largest prime numbers.
