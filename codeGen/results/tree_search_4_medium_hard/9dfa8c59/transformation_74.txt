===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop an iterative solution by generating all prime numbers up to n_max, then checking the number of permutations for each one.
The base case is when n exceeds n_max. The state then becomes None.

Generate prime numbers up to n_max as the state, and the transition relationship is:
    1. Iterate from 2 to sqrt(n) (inclusive)
    2. For each candidate prime p, check if it's divisible by any number less than or equal to its square root
    3. If not, mark it as a prime number
    4. Check the number of permutations for each prime number using an algorithm like the one below:
        * Convert the prime number into a list of digits
        * Calculate the number of unique digits
        * Calculate the number of ways to arrange these unique digits (k_perms)
    Use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming by filling in a table from smallest to largest primes

Count the total number of prime numbers that meet the condition k_perms
Find the smallest and largest prime numbers among those that meet the condition
Return [count, smallest_prime, largest_prime]
