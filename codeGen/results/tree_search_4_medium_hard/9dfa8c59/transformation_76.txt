===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop an iterative solution by generating all prime numbers up to n_max, then checking the number of permutations for each one.

The base case is when n exceeds n_max. The state then becomes None.

Generate prime numbers up to n_max as the state, and the transition relationship is checking if the number of permutations for each prime number meets the condition k_perms.

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with a 2D array dp, where dp[i][j] represents the count of prime numbers with j prime permutations below i.

Fill in the base case first (dp[1][k] = 0 for all k), then iteratively update dp[i][j] using previously computed values and the transition relationship.

The final answer is stored in dp[n_max][k_perms].
