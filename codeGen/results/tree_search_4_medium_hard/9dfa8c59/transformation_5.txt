===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers, then iterate over each number below n_max to count its permutations.

Let the state be a tuple (num, k) where num is a prime number below n_max and k is the count of its permutations that are also prime numbers below n_max.
Let the transition relationship be: If the current number has exactly k_ perms prime permutations, increment the count by 1.

Store the permutations of each prime number in a dictionary and increment the count when a permutation is found to be a prime number.
Use dynamic programming to store the counts of prime numbers with k_ perms prime permutations below n_max.

The base case is when num is less than 2 (not prime), so return 0.
For each prime number up to n_max:
    Generate all permutations of the prime number
    For each permutation, check if it's a prime number and increment the count if it is
    Store the count in a dictionary with the prime number as key

The final answer is the count of prime numbers that have exactly k_ perms prime permutations below n_max, along with the smallest and largest such prime numbers.
