===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming approach with a recursive function that checks if a number is prime and has k_perms permutations, updating the results as needed.

State: (n, k) where n is the current prime number and k is the count of its prime permutations. Initialize an empty dictionary dp to store the state.

Implement recursion with a memoized function:
- If n > n_max, return 0.
- Check if n is prime. If not, return 0.
- Count the prime permutations for n by rearranging its digits and checking each resulting number against the dp dictionary.
- Update dp with the count of prime permutations for n.
- If k_perms matches the count of prime permutations for n, increment a global count of such numbers.
- Recursively call the function for all possible next prime numbers below n_max.

Return the count of such prime numbers, the smallest and largest among them. If no such prime numbers are found, return [0, 0, 0].
