===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers up to n_max.

Create a dictionary storing the count of permutations for each prime number below n_max, where the key is the prime number and the value is its permutation count. This can be done by iterating over each prime number and counting its unique permutations.

Sort the dictionary by values (permutation counts) in descending order to ensure that we process the prime numbers with k_perms before those without.

Create a dynamic programming table to store the permutation counts for each prime number and its corresponding count of k_perms. Initialize the table with zeros.

Iterate over the sorted dictionary, and for each prime number:

* Check if the permutation count is equal to k_perms.
* If true, increment the count in the dynamic programming table.
* Update the smallest and largest prime numbers in the table as needed.

Return the count from the dynamic programming table, along with the smallest and largest prime numbers. If no such prime numbers are found, return [0, 0, 0].
