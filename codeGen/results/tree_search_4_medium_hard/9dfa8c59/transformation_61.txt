===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming with a recursive function that checks if a number is prime and has k_perms permutations, updating the results as needed.
Base case: when n_max is less than or equal to 2, as prime numbers below this value have no more than one permutation.
Recursive function:
    - Check if the number is prime
    - If not prime, return false
    - If prime, check if it has k_perms permutations
        - If yes, update the results accordingly
        - If no, recursively call the function on smaller numbers and update the results
Memoization or tabulation for optimization:
    - Use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and look them up instead of recomputing them
    - Alternatively, use a 2D table to store the results of subproblems and look them up instead of recomputing them
Apply dynamic programming by tabulating the results of subproblems and using them to solve larger problems:
    - Initialize a 2D table with all zeros
    - Fill in the table for numbers less than or equal to n_max, and update the results accordingly
    - Return the count of prime numbers that have exactly k_perms prime permutations below n_max, along with the smallest and largest prime numbers among them
