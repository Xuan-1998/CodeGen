===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about dynamic programming with a recursive function that checks if a number is prime and has k_perms permutations, updating the results as needed.

Consider using a state variable to represent the count of prime numbers with exactly k_perms prime permutations below n_max.
State: k, where k is the count of prime numbers with exactly k_perms prime permutations below n_max.

Maintain a separate dictionary or set to keep track of prime numbers and their corresponding permutation counts. Initialize it as an empty dictionary or set.

As you iterate through each number from 2 to n_max, check if it's prime using a helper function. If it's prime:

* Generate all possible permutations for the current prime number.
* Count the number of permutations that are also prime (using another helper function).
* Update the state variable k and the dictionary or set accordingly.

At the end, return the count of prime numbers with exactly k_perms prime permutations below n_max, along with the smallest and largest such primes.
