===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers below n_max, then iterate over each number in the hash set to count its permutations.
The base case would be when the input number is less than or equal to 1. In this case, there are no prime numbers with k_perms prime permutations.
Formulate state and transition relationships between consecutive prime numbers, using dynamic programming to find the number of prime numbers with k_perms prime permutations below n_max.
Store the intermediate results in a dictionary (key: prime number, value: count of permutations), then use this data structure to look up previously computed values.
Use the stored counts to determine the smallest and largest prime numbers among those with k_perms prime permutations.
Finally, return the count, smallest, and largest as a list or tuple.
