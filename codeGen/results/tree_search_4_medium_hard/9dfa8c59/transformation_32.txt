===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers, then iterate over each number below n_max to count its permutations.
A dictionary storing the count of permutations for each prime number below n_max, where the key is the prime number and the value is its permutation count.
Create a 2D array to store the permutation counts for each prime number below n_max, with the first dimension representing prime numbers and the second dimension representing the permutation counts.
Iterate over each prime number in the hash set, and for each prime number, iterate over all possible permutations of its digits. Count the number of prime permutations for each prime number.
Store the count of prime permutations in a dictionary where the key is the prime number and the value is the permutation count.
Find the smallest and largest prime numbers among those with k_perms prime permutations below n_max.
Return the count, smallest, and largest as the final output.
