===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop an iterative solution by generating all prime numbers up to n_max.
The state is a tuple (n, k_perms_count) where n is the current prime number and k_perms_count is the count of its permutations that are less than or equal to k_perms.

The transition relationship is checking if the number of permutations for i is less than or equal to k_perms. 
If true, update the state's value; otherwise, skip this iteration.
Apply tabulation by initializing an array dp of size n_max+1 with zeros and updating each cell based on the number of permutations for the previous prime number.

For edge cases, check if k_perms is greater than 0 to avoid division by zero error. If k_perms is not within [1,3], handle this case accordingly.
