===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming with recursive function:
  - Check if a number is prime and has k_perms permutations
  - Update results as needed
State variable: (n, k) where n is the current number and k is the count of its prime permutations, updated recursively
Tabulation using 2D array to store state variable values

Updated plan:
  - Initialize a 2D array dp[n_max+1][k_perms+1] with all zeros
  - Iterate through numbers from 2 to n_max
    - For each number, check if it's prime and has k_perms permutations
      - If yes, update dp[n][k] and recursively call the function for smaller numbers
    - Update the smallest and largest prime numbers found so far
  - Return [count of prime numbers with k_perms permutations, smallest prime number, largest prime number]

===END PLAN===
