===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers, then iterate over each number below n_max to count its permutations.

A dictionary storing the count of permutations for each prime number below n_max, where the key is the prime number and the value is its permutation count.

Create a set to store prime numbers, then iterate over each number below n_max to count its permutations.

Use dynamic programming to build up a table of prime numbers and their permutation counts. For every number below n_max:
    Check if it's prime.
    If it's prime, calculate the number of permutations (which is the factorial of the number of digits).
    Store the prime number and its permutation count in the dictionary.

Check the dictionary for prime numbers with exactly k_perms prime permutations.
Count these prime numbers.
Find the smallest and largest such prime numbers.

Return a list containing the count, smallest prime, and largest prime.
