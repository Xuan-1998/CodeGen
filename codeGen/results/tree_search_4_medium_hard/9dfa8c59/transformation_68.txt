===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop an iterative solution by generating all prime numbers up to n_max, then checking the number of permutations for each one.

1. Initialize an empty dictionary dp where keys are prime numbers and values are tuples (n, k_perms_count) representing the current prime number and its permutation count.
2. Iterate through all prime numbers up to n_max:
    a. For each prime number p:
        i. Count the number of permutations for p using a helper function get_permutations(p).
        ii. Update dp[p] with (p, k_perms_count) where k_perms_count is the number of permutations.
3. Initialize three variables: count, smallest, and largest to track the count of prime numbers with k_perms permutations, the smallest prime number, and the largest prime number respectively.
4. Iterate through the dictionary dp:
    a. For each entry (p, k_perms_count) in dp:
        i. If k_perms_count is equal to k_perms, increment count, update smallest if p is smaller than smallest, and update largest if p is larger than largest.
5. Return [count, smallest, largest] as the output.
