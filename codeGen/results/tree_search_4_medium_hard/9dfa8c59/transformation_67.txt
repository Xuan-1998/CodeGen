===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop an iterative solution by generating all prime numbers up to n_max, then checking the number of permutations for each one.

The state is (n, k_perms_count), where n is the current prime number and k_perms_count is the count of its permutations that are less than or equal to k_perms.

Memoize a function that counts the permutations for a given prime number. This can be done by generating all permutations of the digits in the prime number and counting how many are less than or equal to k_perms.

Use a dictionary to store the memoized results, with keys being prime numbers and values being their corresponding permutation counts.

For each prime number, count its permutations that are less than or equal to k_perms. If this count is equal to k_perms, increment the total count of prime numbers with k_perms permutations.

Keep track of the smallest and largest such prime numbers.

Return a list containing the total count, smallest prime number, and largest prime number.
