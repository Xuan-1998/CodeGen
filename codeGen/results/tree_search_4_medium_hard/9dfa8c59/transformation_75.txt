===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop an iterative solution by generating all prime numbers up to n_max, then checking the number of permutations for each one.

* Initialize a dictionary memo to store the results of subproblems
* Define a function is_prime(n) to check if a number is prime
* Iterate over all numbers up to n_max:
	+ If the number is not in memo or its value is None, calculate the number of permutations using the is_permutation function and update memo
	+ Check if the number of permutations meets the condition k_perms:
		- If yes, increment a count variable
		- Update the smallest and largest prime numbers
* Return the count, smallest, and largest prime numbers
