===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers below n_max and then iterate over each number in this set to count its permutations.
Maintain two arrays dp1 and dp2 where:
    - dp1[i] represents whether i is a prime number
    - dp2[i] stores the count of permutations for the prime number i
Create an array perms to store the permutation counts for all numbers below n_max
 Iterate over each number i in [1, n_max]
    - Check if i is prime using the hash set and update dp1[i] accordingly
    - Count the permutations for i by sorting all possible permutations of its digits (this can be done using recursion or iteration) and update dp2[i] accordingly
Count the numbers with exactly k_perms permutations below n_max
    - Iterate over each number i in [1, n_max]
        - Check if dp2[i] equals k_perms and i is prime (i.e., dp1[i])
            - If yes, increment the count of such numbers
Return the count of such numbers, the smallest and largest prime numbers among them
    - Return [count, min_prime, max_prime]
