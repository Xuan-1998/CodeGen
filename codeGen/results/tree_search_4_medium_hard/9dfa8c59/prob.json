"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given an upper limit `n_max` and a number of prime permutations `k_perms`, find the number of prime numbers that have exactly `k_perms` prime permutations below `n_max`. A prime permutation is formed by rearranging the digits of a prime number. Return the count of such prime numbers, the smallest and largest prime numbers among them. If no such prime numbers are found, return `[0, 0, 0]`.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of two integers `n_max` and `k_perms`. The input is read from standard input. `n_max` is an integer less than or equal to 10000 and `k_perms` is an integer less than or equal to 3.\\n\\nOutput: The output is a list of three integers: the count of prime numbers with `k_perms` prime permutations below `n_max`, the smallest prime number among them and the largest prime number among them.\\n\\nConstraints: `n_max` is an integer between 1 and 10000, inclusive. `k_perms` is an integer between 1 and 3, inclusive.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Sorting', 'Combinatorics', 'Dynamic programming', 'Mathematics', 'Data structures']\", \"difficulties\": \"MEDIUM_HARD\", \"source\": \"codewars\", \"url\": \"https://www.codewars.com/kata/55eec0ee00ae4a8fa0000075\", \"sample_test_cases\": []}"
