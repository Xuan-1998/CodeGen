===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers and an array dp where dp[i] represents whether number i is prime and has exactly k_perms prime permutations below n_max.
Let the state be a boolean value indicating whether the current number is prime, and the base case would be when the number is less than 2.
Implement a tabulation-based solution using a 2D table where:
    - The rows represent numbers from 0 to n_max
    - The columns represent whether each number is prime and has exactly k_perms prime permutations
Iterate over each number below n_max, check if it's prime and count its permutations. For each prime number:
    - Check if the number of permutations is equal to k_perms
    - Update dp array accordingly
Finally, iterate over dp array to find the count of prime numbers with exactly k_perms prime permutations, the smallest, and largest among them.
Return [count, smallest, largest]
