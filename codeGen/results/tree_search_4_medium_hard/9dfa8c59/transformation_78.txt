===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop an iterative solution by generating all prime numbers up to n_max.
Then, for each prime number, count the number of permutations (which is equivalent to calculating its prime factors).
The base case is when n exceeds n_max. The state then becomes None.
Represent the state as a dictionary with two keys: "count" and "smallest".
The key "count" stores the total count of prime numbers with k_perms permutations, and the key "smallest" stores the smallest such prime number.

The transition relationship is:
- If the current prime number has more than k_perms permutations, update the state's "count" by incrementing it.
- Update the state's "smallest" if the current prime number is smaller than the previous smallest one found.

Memoize the function that checks if a number is prime, so it's only calculated once per number.

Finally, return the state's "count", "smallest", and the largest such prime number (found by iterating over the dictionary).
