===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about dynamic programming with a recursive function that checks if a number is prime and has k_perms permutations, updating the results as needed.
The state expression could be 'num_permutations' for a given prime number, and the base case would be when num_permutations equals k_perms.

State: {is_prime, num_permutations}: Whether the current number is prime and the number of permutations
Use memoization to store the results of checking if a number is prime and has k_perms permutations

To improve the plan:
* Consider using an iterative approach instead of recursive function to avoid potential stack overflow issues for larger values of n_max.
* When checking if a number is prime, consider using a more efficient primality test such as the Miller-Rabin test or the Sieve of Eratosthenes instead of a simple trial division method.

Potential issues with the plan:
* The recursive function may cause a stack overflow for large values of n_max, which could be a problem if the input is very large.
* The base case may not cover all edge cases (e.g., what happens when num_permutations exceeds k_perms?).

Edge cases:
* Handle the case where k_perms is 0 or less. In this case, return [0, 0, 0] as there are no prime numbers with that many permutations.
* Handle the case where n_max is less than 2. In this case, return [0, 0, 0] as all prime numbers would have more than k_perms permutations.
