===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers below n_max. 
Let state be a tuple (num, k) where num is a prime number and k is the count of its permutations that are also prime numbers below n_max.
Define three states: 'prime', 'permutation' and 'done'. Transition from 'prime' to 'permutation' when a permutation is found to be prime. From 'permutation' state, transition back to 'prime' if it's not equal to k_perms or 'done' if it is equal to k_perms.
Use memoization by storing previously computed values in a dictionary to avoid redundant computations. 
Keep track of the smallest and largest prime numbers with k_perms permutations below n_max.

When computing the count, keep track of the current smallest and largest prime numbers found so far.
At the end, return [count, smallest_prime, largest_prime].
