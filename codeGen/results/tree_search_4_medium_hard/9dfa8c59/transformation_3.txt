===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a hash set to store prime numbers up to n_max.
Let the state be a tuple (num, k) where num is a prime number and k is the count of its permutations that are also prime numbers below n_max.
The transition relationship can be formulated as:
    1. For each prime number p in the hash set:
        2. For each permutation p' of p (generate all permutations):
            3. If p' is a prime number and less than or equal to n_max, increment k by 1.
    4. Use a dictionary to store the state where the key is the tuple (num, k) and the value is the count of such numbers.
    5. Iterate over each prime number below n_max and check if its permutations satisfy k_perms == k.
    6. If found, return [count, smallest_prime, largest_prime] where count is the total count, smallest_prime is the smallest prime number, and largest_prime is the largest prime number among them.
