===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the values in a bottom-up manner using dynamic programming to build up the solution from base cases.

State: s[n] is the minimum number of comparisons required to determine the most beautiful girl among n participants, and f(n) = s[1] + 2s[2] + ... + ns[n-1].

Define the state s[(n, k)] as the minimum number of comparisons required to determine the most beautiful girl among n participants when the current girl's position is k.

Utilize memoization by storing the intermediate results in a dictionary and look up the values as needed.

For each girl's comparison, consider all possible subgroups. When calculating f(n), consider all possible subgroups and choose the one with the minimum number of comparisons.

When l = 1 or r = n, directly calculate the result without considering subgroups.

Store the results in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.
