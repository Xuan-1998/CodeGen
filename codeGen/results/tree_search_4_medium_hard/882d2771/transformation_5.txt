===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

Let's consider the state as a tuple (n, i) where n is the number of girls and i is the group index. The state's value is the minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from the girls in the current group.

We can implement tabulation or memoization based on this idea. Initialize a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of comparisons required to select the most beautiful girl from the i-th to j-th groups.

The base case is when i = l, representing the first group. In this case, f(n) can be calculated as:

f(n) = 1 + min(dp[l-1][i]) for i in range(l, r+1)

Now, we need to fill up the dp array based on the above formula. This is where memoization comes into play.

For each state (n, i), calculate f(i) using the following recurrence:

f(n, i) = 1 + min(f(m, j)) for m in range(l, i+1) and j in range(m, r+1)

The final answer is f(r).

Note that edge cases are handled by considering l = 2, as per the problem constraint.

This plan seems to be correct and should give the desired result. The key idea is to use memoization based on the optimal substructure of the problem.
