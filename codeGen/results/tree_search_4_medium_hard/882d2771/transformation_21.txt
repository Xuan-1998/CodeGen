===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.
f(2n) = 1 + f(n)
dp[i] = min(dp[j] + dp[k]) for all j, k such that 1 <= j < i and l <= k < r
Memoize f(n) for all n from 2 to r and use it to calculate f(r) + l·f(l), then use this value to calculate t0·f(l) + t1·f(l + 1) + ... + tr - l·f(r)
Calculate dp[1] = 0
For i from 2 to r:
    For j from 1 to i-1:
        For k from l to min(i, r):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + dp[k])
Memoize dp values and use them to calculate f(r) = dp[r]
Calculate the final result: t0·f(l) + t1·f(l + 1) + ... + tr - l·f(r)
