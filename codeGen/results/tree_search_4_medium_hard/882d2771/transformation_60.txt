===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

f(2n+1) = f(n) + 1 (since we compare girls in pairs)
f(2n) = f(n) + n (since we have n comparisons to make)

Tabulate the dynamic programming state with an array dp, where dp[i] represents the minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from i girls in a beauty contest.

dp[1] = 0 (base case: no comparisons needed for one girl)
dp[2] = 1 (base case: one comparison needed for two girls)

For larger n, we have:
dp[n] = min(dp[i] + dp[j] + 1) for all i, j < n such that i + j = n

Initialize the dp array with values for small n and calculate the rest using the above recurrence relation.
