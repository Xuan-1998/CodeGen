===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

base case: f(1) = 0

Let s(n) be the number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from a group of n girls. Then we can formulate state and transition relationships as:

s(n) = min(s(m1) + 1 + s(m2)) for all m1, m2 in range(1, n), where m1 + m2 = n.

This way, we can use dynamic programming to calculate f(n).

Use a memoization dictionary where f(i) is calculated only once and stored for future use. Then use dynamic programming to combine the results of smaller instances.

Since we need to find the minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from n girls, we should store the minimum value instead of just storing the result.

For calculating s(n), we can start by initializing a dictionary memo with base case f(1) = 0. Then for each group size n in range(2, r+1):

- Calculate s(n) as the minimum of s(m1) + 1 + s(m2) for all m1, m2 such that m1 + m2 = n.

Finally, calculate and return the expression t0·f(l) + t1·f(l + 1) + ... + tr - l·f(r) modulo 109 + 7.
