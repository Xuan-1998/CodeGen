===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the values in a bottom-up manner using dynamic programming to build up the solution from base cases.

State: f(n) = minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from n girls.

Propose that f(n) can be expressed as the sum of the minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed for each group of girls in state f(m), where m is an integer representing the size of the group.

Define base cases:
f(1) = 0 (no comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from one girl)

Build up a table of values using dynamic programming:

* Initialize table with zeros
* For each group size n, calculate f(n) as the sum of f(m) for each m in [1, n-1]
* Use memoization to store and reuse previously calculated values
