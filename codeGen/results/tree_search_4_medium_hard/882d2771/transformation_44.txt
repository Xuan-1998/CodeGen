===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

Let's define dp[k] as the minimum total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from k girls. Then, we can calculate dp[r] using the following recurrence:

dp[k] = min(g(i, k - 1)) for i from l to r

Now, let's analyze this plan step by step:

1. Initialize a table dp of size (r-l+1)*109+7.

2. For each k from l to r, calculate dp[k] using the recurrence above.

3. Finally, return t0路dp[l] + t1路dp[l+1] + ... + tr路dp[r] - l路f(r) modulo 109 + 7 as the result.

This plan seems correct and should work for calculating the value of the expression. However, we need to make sure that g(i, k-1) is well-defined and can be calculated efficiently.
