===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize values computed during recursion to avoid redundant calculations and accelerate computation.

The state is (l, r), where f(l) + f(l+1) + ... + f(r) represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from l girls to r girls.

Defining a recursive function to calculate f(n) for n > 2 as the minimum of:

f(2) calculated recursively as the minimum of f(1) + 1 and f(3)

And for n = 1, f(1) is 0 (no comparisons needed).

Implement memoization with a recursive function to store previously computed values in a dictionary or hash table.

Store the base cases (f(2), f(1)) before recursing to avoid redundant calculations.

Update the recursive function to calculate f(n) as:

Min(f(l), Min(f(l+1), ..., f(r))) - l

Where f(k) is calculated recursively for k > 2, or directly for k â‰¤ 2.

Memoize these values and store them in a dictionary.

Finally, use the memoized values to calculate the result modulo 109 + 7.
