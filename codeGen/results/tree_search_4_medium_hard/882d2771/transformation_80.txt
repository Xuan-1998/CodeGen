===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize values computed during recursion to avoid redundant calculations and accelerate computation.

Define state as a tuple (i, j) where i is the number of groups and j is the maximum number of girls per group. State: (n, k) where n is the remaining number of girls and k is the current group size.

Tabulate solution using dynamic programming table with dimensions (r-l+1) x t
