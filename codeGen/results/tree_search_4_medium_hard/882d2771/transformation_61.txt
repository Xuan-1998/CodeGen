===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

base case: f(1) = 0

state: The current number of girls, n
transition: When we select one girl from each group. We add the comparison cost of the groups and recursively calculate the minimum comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant in each group.

correct approach: Implement dynamic programming using a bottom-up approach by initializing a table dp[] of size (r - l + 1) with all elements set to infinity, then iteratively calculate the values in the table. The base case would be setting dp[0] = 0.

edge cases: Ensure that the base case f(1) = 0 is handled correctly.

improvement: Use a more efficient data structure such as a list or vector instead of initializing the entire table at once, and only calculate the values as needed.

potential issues: The plan does not handle edge cases where l > r. It also assumes that the input values are within the constraints specified in the problem statement.
