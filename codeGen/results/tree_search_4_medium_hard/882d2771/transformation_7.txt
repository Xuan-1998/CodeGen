The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n. This observation is correct.

f(n) = 1 + min(f(i)) for i in range(l, r+1)
Define the transition function such that it takes two states (m, j) and (n, k) as input, where m < n, and returns a new state (n, i) with its value being the minimum total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from all girls in the current group. This step is correct.

Tabulate the values of f(n) for n ranging from l to r, and store them in an array. Then, calculate the value of f(n) for each n in range(l, r+1) using the previously computed values and update a new table or array with the calculated values.
To avoid redundant calculations, it's better to fill the array in a bottom-up manner, i.e., start from n = l and move towards n = r. This way, you can ensure that the value of f(n) is calculated only once.

The plan does not explicitly include edge cases, but by considering the constraints 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 5·106, we can assume that all values are within a reasonable range and there won't be any issues with integer overflows or underflows.
