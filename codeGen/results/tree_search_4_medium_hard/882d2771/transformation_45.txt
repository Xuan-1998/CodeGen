===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

f(2n) = 2*f(n)

Consider f(n) as a function of the form f(n) = min(g(k, n - 1)) for k from l to r

Maintain a memoization table of size (r-l+1)*109+7 using a dictionary
Create a dictionary dp where dp[i] will store the minimum comparisons required to select the most beautiful participant from i girls
For each girl i in the range [l, r], calculate f(i) = min(dp[k] + k for k in range(l-1, i)) and update dp[i]
Return f(r)
