===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let's define dp[i] as the minimum total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from i girls in a beauty contest.

The base case is when there is only one girl left, which is 0 comparisons.

For larger values of i, we can calculate f(i) by considering the last two girls and combining the results. The optimal substructure is that f(i) = 1 + min(f(j) + 1, j - dp[j-1]) for some j < i. This is because we need to select the most beautiful girl from each group until there is only one girl left.

We can use memoization to store the results of smaller instances and avoid redundant calculations.

The recursive function would be:

f(i) = 1 + min(f(j) + 1, j - dp[j-1]) for some j < i

where dp[i] is calculated recursively as:

dp[i] = 1 + min(dp[j] + 1, j - dp[j-1]) for some j < i

The base case is when there is only one girl left, which is 0 comparisons.

We can use a loop to iterate from r to l and calculate the values of f(i) and dp[i] in a bottom-up manner.

Finally, we can return the value of f(r) as the answer.
