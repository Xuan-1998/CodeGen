===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

base case: f(1) = 0
f(n) = min(f(m) + 1, f(n-1)) if n > 2, where m is the maximum possible value of a group.
Employ top-down memoization by recursively calculating f(n) with proper pruning and caching.

Dynamic programming can be applied to calculate f(n) for all n from l to r. This can reduce the computation time significantly.

f(n) = f(n-1) + 1 if n > 2

We can also use binary search to narrow down the range of f(n) values that we need to check.

The base case is correct, and the recursive formula is also correct.
However, there might be some edge cases where the problem requires handling a special situation or exception.
For example, if t = 0, then the answer would be 0.
Another potential issue with this plan is that it may not handle the modulo operation correctly.

So, to improve the plan, we can add error checking for edge cases and make sure our calculation takes into account the modulo operation.

Finally, the updated version of the plan is shown below:
