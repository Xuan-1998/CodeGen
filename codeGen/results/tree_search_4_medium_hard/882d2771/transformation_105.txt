===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the values in a bottom-up manner using dynamic programming to build up the solution from base cases.
State: dp[i][j] represents the minimum total number of comparisons required to select the most beautiful girl from i groups with j participants each.

dp[i][0] = 0, for all i (base case: selecting the most beautiful girl from an empty group doesn't require any comparison)
dp[0][j] = 1, for all j (base case: selecting the most beautiful girl from a single group requires one comparison)

State transition:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + 1) for k in range(2, j+1); (consider each possible number of participants and choose the minimum)
Use a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum total number of comparisons required to select the most beautiful girl from i groups with j participants each.
