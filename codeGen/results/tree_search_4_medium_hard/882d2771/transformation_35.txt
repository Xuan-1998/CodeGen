The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

Let's define a new function F(x) as the sum of the minimum number of comparisons required to select the most beautiful participant from i participants for 0 ≤ i ≤ x. The transition relationship can be formulated as:

F(i) = min(F(i-1) + 1, F(i-2) + 2)

To utilize dynamic programming with top-down approach and implement memoization using recursion with a memoization dictionary to store the calculated values of f(n). This way, we avoid redundant calculations.

The initial values of F(x) for x = 0, 1 are trivially solved as F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1. Then, for each i > 1:

F(i) = min(F(i-1) + 1, F(i-2) + 2)

Finally, the answer is F(r) - l * F(r).
