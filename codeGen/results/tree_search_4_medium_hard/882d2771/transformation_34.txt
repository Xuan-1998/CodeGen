The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

f(2n+1) = f(n) + n (this equation is suspicious, it seems to imply that the number of comparisons grows linearly with the number of participants. However, in reality, the number of comparisons might not grow as fast).

F(x) = F(0) + F(1) + ... + F(x), where F(i) is the minimum number of comparisons required to select the most beautiful participant from i participants. This equation seems to describe a problem that is different from the original one.

To use dynamic programming with bottom-up approach and implement tabulation by creating a table dp[] where dp[i] stores the minimum number of comparisons required to select the most beautiful participant from i participants. 

However, this plan does not take into account the given expression t0·f(l) + t1·f(l+1) + ... + tr - l·f(r), which seems crucial for solving the problem.

A better approach would be to analyze the expression and find a way to calculate it using dynamic programming.
