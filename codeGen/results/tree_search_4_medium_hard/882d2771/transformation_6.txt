===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

Let's define dp[i][k] as the minimum total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from all girls in group i to k. 

The transition function can be defined as:

dp[n][k] = 1 + min(dp[m][j]) for m in range(l, k+1) and j in range(l, n)

This is because we need to find the minimum total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from all girls in group l to k. We can do this by considering each group i from l to k separately, where i ranges from m to k. For each group i, we need to compare all girls in that group to their neighbors, which requires dp[i-1][i-1] comparisons. Then, we add the number of groups we need to consider, which is k-l+1.

Memoize the transition function using dynamic programming by creating a 3D table dp where dp[n][k][m] stores the minimum total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from all girls in group n to k considering m groups. 

The base case for our recursion can be when n=k, which means we only need to consider one group.

Finally, calculate the value of the expression t0·f(l) + t1·f(l + 1) + ... + tr - l·f(r), calculated modulo 109 + 7.
