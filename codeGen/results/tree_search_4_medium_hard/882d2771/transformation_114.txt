===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the values in a bottom-up manner using dynamic programming to build up the solution from base cases.

State: s[n] is the minimum number of comparisons required to determine the most beautiful girl among n participants, and f(n) = t0·s[l] + t1·s[l+1] + ... + tr - l·s[r].

Consider the state as a tuple (i, k), where i is the number of girls remaining and k is the current girl's position in the beauty contest.

Use dynamic programming to build up the solution from base cases by iteratively calculating the minimum number of comparisons required for each state (i, k).

Let dp[i][k] be the minimum number of comparisons required when there are i girls remaining and the current girl is at position k. 

dp[1][1] = 0: no comparisons needed to determine the most beautiful girl among a single participant.

for i from 2 to n:
    for k from 1 to i:
        dp[i][k] = min(dp[i-1][j] + 1) for j from 1 to k-1

f(n) = t0·dp[l][l] + t1·dp[l+1][l+1] + ... + tr - l·dp[r][r]
