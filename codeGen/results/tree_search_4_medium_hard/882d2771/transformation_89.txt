===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize values computed during recursion to avoid redundant calculations and accelerate computation.

The state is (r, k), where f(r) represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from r girls with at most k pairs of identical clothes.

f(l, r) = 
    if l == 1: 
        min(1, r - 1)
    else:
        min(f(l-1, min(r, l-1)) + (r - (l-1)), f(min(r, l-2), l-1)) + 1

Employ bottom-up approach, initializing an array with base cases and iteratively calculating larger values.
