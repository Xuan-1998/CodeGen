===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize values computed during recursion to avoid redundant calculations and accelerate computation.

The state is (r, k), where f(r) represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from r girls with at most k pairs of identical clothes.

Let state S = (r, k), where f(S) represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from r girls with at most k pairs of identical clothes.

Use dynamic programming to create a table dp where dp[i][k] is the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from i girls with at most k pairs of identical clothes, and iterate through all possible values of i and k to fill the table.

Let's say we have already computed f(r) for r = 0 to R-1. Now, consider f(R). We can write it as the sum of the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from the girls in groups R-i, where i is the number of identical pairs, and the remaining R-i girls.

This can be written as:

f(R) = min(f(R-1), f(R-2), ..., f(0)) + 1

This is a recursive formula that we can use to compute f(r) for r = 0 to R. We just need to make sure that we don't repeat any computations by storing the results in a table.
