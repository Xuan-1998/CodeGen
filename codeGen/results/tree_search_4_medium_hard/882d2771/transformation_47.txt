===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n. However, we need to consider the groups and the most beautiful girl selected from each group.
f(2n) = 1 + f(n)
We create a dynamic programming table dp where dp[i] represents the minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from i girls.
The transition relation is: 
dp[2*i] = 1 + min(dp[j] for j in range(i))
where we consider each possible group size j and take the minimum
