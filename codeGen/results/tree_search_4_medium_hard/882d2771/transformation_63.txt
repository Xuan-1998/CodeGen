The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

base case: f(1) = 0
The state is the current number of girls, and the transition is when we split a group into two.
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to fill up a table dp[n] where dp[n] represents the minimum total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from n girls.

We will initialize dp[1] = 0 as it takes no comparisons to choose the only girl. Then for each group size i from 2 to r, we calculate f(i) by considering all possible splits of the groups into two smaller groups of sizes j and k such that j + k = i. The minimum total number of comparisons is the minimum of the left and right parts plus one (for the comparison between the most beautiful girls in each part).

This approach ensures we consider all possible ways to split the group into smaller groups, which is essential for this problem.
