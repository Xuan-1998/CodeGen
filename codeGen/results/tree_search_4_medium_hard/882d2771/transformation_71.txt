===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize values computed during recursion to avoid redundant calculations and accelerate computation.

The state is (l, r), where f(l) + f(l+1) + ... + f(r) represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from l girls to r girls.
We need to handle edge cases: when t = 0 or t = 1.

Memoize the recursive function f(n) by storing its return values for different inputs n and use these stored values to avoid redundant calculations.

Define base case: f(2) = 3, since we can compare all pairs of girls once.

For larger r, we need to handle cases where l is even or odd. When l is even, we have a choice between comparing the middle two girls or comparing the left and right halves separately.
When l is odd, we have a choice between comparing the middle girl with the leftmost and rightmost girls, or splitting the array into three parts.

This plan can be improved by handling edge cases more explicitly, such as f(1) = 0 (no comparisons needed when there's only one girl).
The potential issues with this plan are that it does not specify how to handle cases where l is large and r is close to l. However, this should still provide a good starting point for solving the problem.
