===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the values in a bottom-up manner using dynamic programming to build up the solution from base cases.

State: f(n) = minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from n girls.

Consider a recursive relationship where f(n) is the minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from n girls, where each girl is represented by a unique integer in range [1, n].

Use a dictionary memo to store the results of expensive function calls and avoid redundant computations. 

For l <= 2: 
    f(l) = l - 1

Iterate over all possible values of n from l to r:
   For each n:
       If n not in memo:
           Calculate f(n) recursively as the minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from n girls.
           Store result in memo
       Return memo[n] for the value

For t = 0: 
    Initialize result = 0
    Iterate over all possible values of i from l to r:
        Calculate t0·f(i) and add it to the result
    Return result modulo 109 + 7

Otherwise (t > 0): 
    Initialize result = 0
    Iterate over all possible values of i from l to r:
        Calculate ti·f(i) and add it to the result
    Subtract l·f(r) from the result
    Return result modulo 109 + 7
