===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the values in a bottom-up manner using dynamic programming to build up the solution from base cases.

State: f(n) = minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from n girls.

Transition:
	* Consider selecting the most beautiful girl from the current group (n-1).
	* Recursively apply this process to remaining groups (f(n-1)).
Memoize function f(n) directly.
Recalculate: f(2) = 1, f(3) = 2, ...
Updated: f(l) = minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from l girls.

Calculation:
	* t0·f(l) + t1·f(l+1) + ... + tr - l·f(r)
Modulo: 109 + 7

Edge Cases: None
