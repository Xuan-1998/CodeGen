Dynamic Programming Plan:
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

f(2n) = 1 + f(n)

Use memoization by defining a function f that takes an integer n as input and returns the minimum number of comparisons needed, with the help of a dictionary to store the results of subproblems. 

Precompute all values of f up to r, then calculate the answer using these precomputed values.

For edge cases:
- If t=0, return 0
- If l=r, return f(l)
- If t is large, optimize by only storing and recalculating f(n) for n from l to r

The plan can be improved by:
- Optimizing the memoization function by using a more efficient data structure (e.g., array instead of dictionary) for small values of n
- Using binary search or other optimizations to reduce the time complexity of calculating f(n)
- Handling edge cases where t is large and l=r carefully
