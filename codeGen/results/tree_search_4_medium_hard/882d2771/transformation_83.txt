===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize values computed during recursion to avoid redundant calculations and accelerate computation.

Consider a state (i, j) where i is the number of groups and j is the maximum number of girls per group. Define the state as a tuple (i, j).

State: (n, k, g) where n is the remaining number of girls, k is the current group size, and g is the current girl's beauty.

Tabulating values of f(i) for i = 1, 2, ..., r

Define a function dp(n, k, g) that returns the minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from n girls with maximum group size k and beauty g.

For the base case, when there is only one girl left (n == 1), return 0 because no comparisons are needed.

For the recursive case:

1. If k == 1, return the minimal number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from n girls.
2. For each group size j from k down to 1:
   a. Calculate the number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from the first j girls and subtract that from dp(n - j, k, g).
   b. Add the minimal number of comparisons needed to compare the remaining n - j girls.
3. Return the minimum value among all possible combinations in step 2.
