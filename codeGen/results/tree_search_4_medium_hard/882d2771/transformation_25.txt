===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

dp[i] = min(f(j) + dp[k]) for all j, k such that 1 <= j < i and l <= k < r

This plan seems correct. To improve it, we can consider the following:

* Initialize the table dp with size (r - l + 1) and fill it up from the smallest possible values to the largest.

To avoid potential issues, we should consider edge cases such as when l = 2 or r = l. In these cases, f(n) will be calculated separately and added to the final result.

Here's the updated version of the plan:
