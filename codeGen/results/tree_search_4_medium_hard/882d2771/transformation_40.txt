The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.
base case: f(1) = 0
Consider the process of selecting the most beautiful participant from a group of girls as a binary tree. Each node represents a comparison, and each leaf node represents a girl. Then, we can formulate state and transition relationships as:
f(n) = min(f(l) + 1 + f(r)) for all l, r in range(2, n), where l + r = n.
However, this seems overly complex and may not be the most efficient approach. A simpler way to solve this problem is by observing that we can calculate f(n) as follows: 
f(n) = (n - 1) + min(f(l - 1) + f(r - l)) for all l in range(2, n), where l + r = n.
This observation allows us to compute the value of f(n) directly without needing a DP array or backtracking.
The plan can be updated as follows:
f(1) = 0
f(n) = (n - 1) + min(f(l - 1) + f(r - l)) for all l in range(2, n), where l + r = n.
This approach avoids the complexity of a DP array and backtracking, making it more efficient.
