===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

f(2n) = f(n) + f(n)

dp[i] = min(dp[j] + f(k)) for all j, k such that 1 <= j < i and l <= k < r

The choice is to implement dynamic programming using memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary.

However, this plan can be improved. 

We need to establish a recursive relation between f(n) and f(m). This can be done by considering the girls as pairs and counting the number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from each pair.

The base case would be when n is 1 or 2, in which case f(n) = 0.

Then we can use dynamic programming to calculate the value of f(n). 

We can also use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems for memoization. This will help us avoid redundant calculations and reduce the time complexity.

The plan should look something like this:

dp[1] = dp[2] = 0
for i from 3 up to r:
    dp[i] = min(dp[j] + f(k)) for all j, k such that 1 <= j < i and l <= k < r

This is a more detailed and improved version of the plan.
