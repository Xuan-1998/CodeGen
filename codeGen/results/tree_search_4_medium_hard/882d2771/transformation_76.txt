===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize values computed during recursion to avoid redundant calculations and accelerate computation.
The state is (l, r), where f(l) + f(l+1) + ... + f(r) represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from l girls to r girls.

Calculate f(1) as 0, since there's only one girl, so no comparisons are needed.
For state (l, r), calculate f(r-l+1) using the formula t0·f(l) + t1·f(l + 1) + ... + tr - l·f(r) modulo 109 + 7.

Implement dynamic programming by building an array dp where each entry at index i corresponds to the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from l girls to r-i girls.
Initialize dp with f(1) and then fill up the rest of the array based on previously computed values.
Finally, return dp[r] as the result.
