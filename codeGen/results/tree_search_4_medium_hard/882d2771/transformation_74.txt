===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize values computed during recursion to avoid redundant calculations and accelerate computation.
The state is (l, r), where f(l) + f(l+1) + ... + f(r) represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from l girls to r girls.
Define a recursive function to calculate f(n) for n > 2 as the minimum of f(2) and (f(1) + 1), where f(2) is calculated recursively as the minimum of f(1) + 1 and f(3).
Utilize both top-down and bottom-up approaches by using memoization within a recursive function and storing intermediate results.
In addition, consider calculating the values of f(n) for n <= 2 directly since they do not depend on previous calculations.

For l = 2, f(l) is simply 1, as it takes one comparison to select the most beautiful participant from two girls.
For l = 1, f(l) is also 1, as it again takes one comparison to select the most beautiful participant from one girl.

The top-down approach can be improved by using a more efficient way to calculate f(n) for n > 2. Instead of recalculating f(2) and f(3), store their values in the memoization table before calculating f(n).

Finally, ensure that the plan handles edge cases correctly, such as when t = 0 or l < r.
