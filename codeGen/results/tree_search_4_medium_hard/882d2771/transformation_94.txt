===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize values computed during recursion to avoid redundant calculations and accelerate computation.

The state is (r, k), where f(r) represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from r girls with at most k pairs of identical clothes.

Formulate state and transition relationships: 
f(r, k) = min(f(i, k-1) + 1), for all l <= i <= r, where (i, k-1) is a valid state.

Memoize the state (r, k) as a tuple and store the computed values in a dictionary for fast lookups. 

Edge cases: 
Handle base case f(0, k) = 0.
f(r, 0) should return r, since there are no identical clothes to reduce comparisons.

Potential issues:
- Ensure that all states are valid (i.e., i <= r and 0 <= k).
- Verify the correctness of the state transition formula.
