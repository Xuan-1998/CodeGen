f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

Define the transition function such that it takes two states (m, j) and (n, k) as input, where m < n, and returns a new state (n, i) with its value being the minimum total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from all girls in the current group.

f(n) = 1 + min(f(i)) for i in range(l, r+1)

Use memoization by defining a function that calculates f(n) based on the values of f(i) for i ranging from l to r. This function will be called recursively until it reaches a base case where f(2) is defined as 1, and then return the calculated value.

Define the base cases:

- f(2) = 1 (since we can directly select the most beautiful participant)

- Calculate f(n) based on f(i) for i ranging from l to r. This will involve iterating over the range and recursively calling the function until it reaches the base case.

The plan seems correct, but there are a few potential issues:

- It does not handle the edge case where n < 2.
- It assumes that f(2) is defined as 1, which might not be true based on the problem statement. We should define what exactly means "the minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant".

The updated plan:
