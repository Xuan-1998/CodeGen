===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the values in a bottom-up manner using dynamic programming to build up the solution from base cases.

State: f(n) = minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from n girls.
Consider selecting the most beautiful girl from current group and then recursively apply this process to remaining groups.

DP with a 2D table dp[k][n] where k is the number of girls selected so far, and n is the remaining girls in the group.

Base case: When there's only one girl left (n = 1), it takes f(n) = 0 comparisons.
Recurrence relation:
- If k > 1, consider selecting the most beautiful girl from the current group.
	+ Selecting the most beautiful girl takes f(1) = 0 comparisons (since we're comparing to nothing).
	+ Recursively apply this process to the remaining groups with k - 1 girls selected so far and n - 1 remaining girls.
	+ Add the minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed for each group.

Calculate dp[k][n] as min(dp[k-1][i] + 1) over all possible i from l to r, inclusive.
