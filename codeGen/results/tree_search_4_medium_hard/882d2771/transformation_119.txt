===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the values in a bottom-up manner using dynamic programming to build up the solution from base cases.

State: s[n] is the minimum number of comparisons required to determine the most beautiful girl among n participants, and f(n) = s[1] + 2s[2] + ... + ns[n-1].

Define the state s[(n, k)] as the minimum number of comparisons required to determine the most beautiful girl among n participants when the current girl's position is k.

Employ a bottom-up approach by initializing the base cases and iteratively building up the solution:

1. Initialize s[0] = 0.
2. For each n from 1 to r:
    - For each k from 1 to n:
        * If this is the first group, s[(n, k)] = 1.
        * Otherwise, calculate the minimum number of comparisons required to determine the most beautiful girl among n participants when the current girl's position is k by considering all possible groups and taking the minimum.
    - Calculate f(n) as the sum of s[i] for i from 1 to n-1, multiplied by i.

Finally, return t0·f(l) + t1·f(l + 1) + ... + tr - l·f(r) modulo 109 + 7.
