===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the values in a bottom-up manner using dynamic programming to build up the solution from base cases.

State: dp[i][j] represents the minimum total number of comparisons required to select the most beautiful girl from i groups with j participants each.

dp[0][j] = 1 for all j (base case, no girls left)
dp[i][1] = i for all i (only one participant in each group)

for l in range(2, r + 1):
    for k in range(l - 1):
        dp[l][k+1] = min(dp[l-1][j] + dp[0][l-k-1]) for j in range(k);

Dynamically build a trie data structure to store the partial solutions and avoid redundant computations.

for t in range(t):
    res += dp[t][r-t]
res %= (10**9 + 7)
