===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

We can use bottom-up dynamic programming instead of top-down. This is because we need to calculate f(l) and f(r) separately before calculating the final answer.

state: dp[i]
transition: dp[i] = 1 + min(dp[j]) for l <= j <= r
Apply bottom-up dynamic programming by filling up the DP table in order from i=l to i=r.

This plan is correct.
