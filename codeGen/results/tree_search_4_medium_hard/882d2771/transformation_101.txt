===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the values in a bottom-up manner using dynamic programming to build up the solution from base cases.

State: f(n) = minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from n girls.

Consider selecting the most beautiful girl from current group and then recursively apply this process to remaining groups.
To avoid redundant computation, use memoization to store previously computed values in a 2D array dp[][] where dp[i][j] represents the minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from i girls from the first j groups.

Tabulate values iteratively in a 1D array and then combine the values using the expression t0·f(l) + t1·f(l + 1) + ... + tr - l·f(r).
