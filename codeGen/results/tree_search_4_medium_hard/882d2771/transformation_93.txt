Memoize values computed during recursion to avoid redundant calculations and accelerate computation.

The state is (r, k), where f(r) represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from r girls with at most k pairs of identical clothes.

Formulate state and transition relationships: 
f(S) = min(f(S - pair) + 1), for all 0 <= pair <= k, 
where S - pair = (r - i, k - 1).

Initialize memo array to store the results of expensive function calls.

Iterate over possible values of r from l to r and for each value of r, iterate over possible values of k from 2 to the number of pairs of identical clothes. 

In each iteration, compute f(r) using the transition relationships.

Store the computed result in the memo array to avoid redundant calculations.

Finally, return the result of f(r) modulo 109 + 7.
