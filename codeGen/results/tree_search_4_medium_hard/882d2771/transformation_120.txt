===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the values in a bottom-up manner using dynamic programming to build up the solution from base cases.

State: s[n] is the minimum number of comparisons required to determine the most beautiful girl among n participants, and f(n) = s[1] + 2s[2] + ... + ns[n-1].

Fathom that f(n) can be expressed as f(n) = (n - 1) * s[n-1] - sum(i=0 to n-2, i*s[i]).

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to fill up a table where each cell represents the minimum number of comparisons required to determine the most beautiful girl among n participants.
Initialize an array dp with size r-l+1 and set dp[0] = 0. For each i from l to r, calculate dp[i] as (i - l + 1) * s[i-l+1] - sum(j=l-1 to i-1, j*dp[j]).

The final answer is the sum of t0*dp[l], t1*dp[l+1], ..., tr*dp[r].
