===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

base case: f(1) = 0
Consider the process of selecting the most beautiful participant from a group of girls as a binary tree. Each node represents a comparison, and each leaf node represents a girl.
Then, we can formulate state and transition relationships as:
f(n) = min(f(l+1) + 1 + f(r)) for all l, r in range(2, n), where l+r=n.

Use a 2D DP table to store the minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from girls in a beauty contest.
Iterate over the DP table rows and columns:
    For each cell (i, j) in the table,
        Calculate f(i+j-1) as min(f(l+1) + 1 + f(r)) for all l, r in range(2, i+j-1), where l+r=i+j-1.
    Store the calculated value in the DP table.

To calculate the final answer:
    Initialize t0路f(l) = 0
    Iterate over the values of t from 0 to t-1:
        Add t0路f(l) + t1路f(l+1) + ... + tr - l路f(r) to the total.
    Return the calculated total modulo 109+7.
