===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

base case: f(1) = 0

Let s(n) be the number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from a group of n girls. Then we can formulate state and transition relationships as:
s(n) = min(s(m1) + 1 + s(m2)) for all m1, m2 in range(1, n), where m1 + m2 = n.

This way, we can use dynamic programming to calculate f(n).

Instead of calculating s(n) directly, let's define a new function dp[n] as the minimum number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from a group of n girls. Then, we have:
dp[0] = 0
dp[1] = 0

For n >= 2, we can calculate dp[n] as:
dp[n] = min(dp[i] + 1 + dp[n - i]) for all i in range(1, (n + 1) // 2)

Finally, the answer is dp[r] - lÂ·f(r).

This plan addresses the optimal substructure and uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The use of memoization is also implied through the definition of dp[n].

The edge cases are correctly handled by setting f(0) = 0 and dp[0] = 0.
