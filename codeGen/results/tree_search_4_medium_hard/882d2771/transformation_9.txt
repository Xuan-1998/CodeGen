===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

f(n) = 1 + min(f(i)) for i in range(l, r+1)

Formulate the problem as a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where each state's value is calculated based on the values of its predecessor states. This can be achieved by using a 2D array to store the DP table and iterating over the rows from top to bottom and columns from left to right.

To improve the plan:

* Instead of calculating f(n) = 1 + min(f(i)) for i in range(l, r+1), we should calculate f(n) based on the values of f(m) for m < n.
* We can use a prefix sum array to store the DP table and iterate over the rows from bottom to top and columns from left to right.

Potential issues with the plan:

* The plan does not account for edge cases, such as when l = 1 or r = 5Â·106. We should ensure that our solution handles these cases correctly.
* The plan assumes that f(n) can be calculated based on the values of smaller instances of f(m), but it does not specify how these instances are related.
