===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the values in a bottom-up manner using dynamic programming to build up the solution from base cases.

State: dp[i][j] represents the minimum total number of comparisons required to select the most beautiful girl from i groups with j participants each.

dp[0][j] = 0 (base case for no groups)
dp[i][1] = 0 (base case for single group)

dp[i][j] = 
    dp[i-1][min(j, i)] + 
    (i > 1 and j > 1) ? 
        dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 : 
    0

Implement a hybrid approach by combining tabulation and memoization. For example, you can precompute and store the values of f(i) for i from l to r, then use these values to tabulate the dynamic programming array.

Precompute and store the values of f(i) for i from l to r:
f(j) = min comparisons required to select the most beautiful girl from j participants
f(j+1) = min comparisons required to select the most beautiful girl from j+1 participants

dp[i][j] = 
    dp[i-1][min(j, i)] + 
    (i > 1 and j > 1) ? 
        f(min(j, i)) : 
    0

Use these precomputed values to tabulate the dynamic programming array:
dp[0][j] = 0
dp[i][1] = 0
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][min(j, i)] + (i > 1 and j > 1) ? f(min(j, i)) : 0

The plan includes edge cases for base cases.
