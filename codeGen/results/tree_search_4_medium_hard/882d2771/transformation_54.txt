The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

To better understand this problem, let's analyze the recurrence relation: f(2n+1) = f(n) + 1. This suggests that we should only need to compute f(n) once and then use it to calculate f(2n+1), f(3n+1), and so on.

We can also rewrite the second equation as f(n) = f(floor((n+2)/3)) + floor((n+2)/3) - n. This suggests that we might need to compute some intermediate values of f(m) for m < n, but these should be memoized to avoid redundant computation.

Memoize the f(n) function by storing the calculated values in a dictionary and returning the memoized value when the same n is encountered again.

Finally, to handle edge cases, we should make sure that our base case is correct. For example, what happens if l = 2 or r = 5*10^6? How do these inputs affect our computation?
