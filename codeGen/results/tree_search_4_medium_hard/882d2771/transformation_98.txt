===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the values in a bottom-up manner using dynamic programming to build up the solution from base cases.

State: f(n) = minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from n girls.

Consider a recursive relationship where f(n) is the minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from n girls, where each girl is represented by a unique integer in range [1, n].

Favor using memoization instead of explicit tabulation as it allows for more flexibility in handling complex recursive relationships.

Iteratively build up solutions for n from 2 to r (inclusive), considering l as the base case. For each n, calculate f(n) based on previously computed values f(i) and f(j) where i < n and j > n.

When calculating f(n), consider all possible partitions of girls into groups, focusing on the most beautiful girl in each group. This can be achieved by iteratively applying a function that compares two girls from different groups and selects the more beautiful one to proceed with the selection process.

At the end of each iteration, update the memoization table with the calculated value f(n) for future reference.
