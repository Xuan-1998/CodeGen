===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize values computed during recursion to avoid redundant calculations and accelerate computation.

The state is (r, k), where f(r) represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from r girls with at most k pairs of identical clothes.

Formulate state and transition relationships:
f(S) = min(f(S - pair) + 1), for all 0 <= pair <= k,
where S - pair = (r - i, k - 1).

Use dynamic programming to tabulate the values of f(r) for all possible values of r and k.
Compute the final answer by summing up the values:
t * f(l) + t1 * f(l+1) + ... + tr * f(r) - l * f(r)
Modulo 109+7.
