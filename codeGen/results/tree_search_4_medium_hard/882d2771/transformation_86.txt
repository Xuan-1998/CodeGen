===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize values computed during recursion to avoid redundant calculations and accelerate computation.
Consider a state (i, j) where i is the number of groups and j is the maximum number of girls per group. Define the state as a tuple (i, j).
State: (i, j) where i is the number of groups and j is the maximum number of girls per group.
Memoize subproblems and prune the search space by exploiting the fact that f(n+1) = min(f(i) + f(n-i)) for 0 ≤ i < n.

Recursively calculate the value of f(n) using the memoized values, ensuring the base case is handled correctly (f(2) = 1).
Calculate the minimum number of comparisons required to select the most beautiful participant from each group.
Iterate through the range [l, r] and update the cumulative sum based on the calculated minimal total number of pairwise comparisons.
Calculate the expression t0·f(l) + t1·f(l + 1) + ... + tr - l·f(r), modulo 109 + 7.
