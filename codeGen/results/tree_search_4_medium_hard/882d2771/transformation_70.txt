===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize values computed during recursion to avoid redundant calculations and accelerate computation.

The state is (l, r), where f(l) + f(l+1) + ... + f(r) represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from l girls to r girls.
Store only the necessary intermediate results in a 2D table, where each cell represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from l girls to r girls for a given value of t.

To improve this plan:

* Initialize the 2D table with a base case (l == r) and fill it up recursively.
* The state can be further broken down into two sub-states: (l, r-1) and (l+1, r). This is because f(l) + f(l+1) + ... + f(r) can be decomposed as f(l) + min(f(l+1) + ... + f(r-1)) + min(f(l+2) + ... + f(r)).
* Use the fact that t0·f(l) + t1·f(l + 1) + ... + tr - l·f(r) is the sum of the values in the row corresponding to l and column corresponding to r.
* Calculate the value modulo 109+7 for each cell in the table.
