===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

Let dp[i] be the minimum number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from i girls, then we have:
dp[n] = 0 if n is even
dp[n] = min(dp[i] + dp[n-i-1]) for all n-i-1 from l to r

Applying tabulation by iteratively building up the solution from the base case and storing the results in an array.

For each i from l to r, calculate:
dp[i] = 0 if i is even
dp[i] = min(dp[j] + dp[i-j-1]) for all j from l to (i-l)

The final answer is dp[r]
