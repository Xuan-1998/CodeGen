===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the values in a bottom-up manner using dynamic programming to build up the solution from base cases.

State: f(n) = minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from n girls.

Propose that f(n) can be expressed as the sum of the minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed for each group of girls in state f(m), where m is an integer representing the size of the group.

Employ memoization by storing previously computed values in a table to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.

Iterate through groups of sizes l, l+1, ..., r and calculate f(n) as the sum of the minimal total number of pairwise comparisons needed for each group, taking into account the grouping dynamics.

Store intermediate results in a table and look up previously computed values when calculating f(n) for larger values of n.
