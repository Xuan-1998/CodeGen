===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the values in a bottom-up manner using dynamic programming to build up the solution from base cases.

State: s[n] is the minimum number of comparisons required to determine the most beautiful girl among n participants, and f(n) = s[1] + 2s[2] + ... + ns[n-1].

Define the state s[(n, k)] as the minimum number of comparisons required to determine the most beautiful girl among n participants when the current girl's position is k.

Consider using a 3D array to store the dynamic programming values and iterate over the rows, columns, and depth accordingly. This is because we need to consider the position (k) and the remaining participants (n-k) separately.

State transition: s[(n, k)] = min(s[(i, j)] + s[(n-i-1, k-j)]) for i = 0 to n-k and j = 0 to k-1, where s[(i, j)] is the minimum number of comparisons required to determine the most beautiful girl among i participants when the current girl's position is j.

Base case: s[1] = 0 (no comparisons needed for a single participant).

Initialization: fill the base case values for s[1] and calculate the initial values for s[(n, k)] using the state transition formula.

Iteration: iterate over the rows (n) and columns (k) until we reach the bottom-right corner of the array. For each cell, use the state transition formula to update its value based on the previously calculated values.

Final calculation: calculate f(n) = s[1] + 2s[2] + ... + ns[n-1].
