===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize values computed during recursion to avoid redundant calculations and accelerate computation.

The state is (r, k), where f(r) represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from r girls with at most k pairs of identical clothes.

Let state S = (r, k), where f(S) represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from r girls with at most k pairs of identical clothes.

Instead of memoization, use tabulation to fill up a 2D table dp[], where dp[i][j] is the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from i girls with at most j pairs of identical clothes.

The base case should be when r = 1, in which case f(r) is simply 0 because there's only one girl.

For the recursive case, consider the following: if the kth pair of identical clothes can divide the girls into two groups such that all girls in each group have different clothes, then we can select the most beautiful participant from each group and compare them. This way, we avoid comparing girls with identical clothes and minimize the total number of comparisons.

This recursive case can be written as f(r) = min(f(l-1) + 1 for l = k+1 to r), where l is the size of the smaller group when we divide the girls into two groups using the kth pair of identical clothes.

The updated plan should include filling up the dp[] table and implementing this recursive case.
