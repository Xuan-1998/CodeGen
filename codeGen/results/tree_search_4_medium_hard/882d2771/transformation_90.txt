===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize values computed during recursion to avoid redundant calculations and accelerate computation.

The state is (r, k), where f(r) represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from r girls with at most k pairs of identical clothes.

Let state S = (r, k), where f(S) represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from r girls with at most k pairs of identical clothes.

Memoize values computed during recursion by creating a dictionary dp to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations. Initialize dp with base cases: f(1, k) = k for 0 ≤ k ≤ t.

To calculate f(S), iterate over all possible ways to divide the girls into groups (represented as group sizes). For each group size g (1 ≤ g ≤ r), consider the minimal total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from the first g girls, and the remaining r - g girls. The minimum total number of comparisons is the minimum of these two cases.

Store the computed value f(S) in dp and return it.
