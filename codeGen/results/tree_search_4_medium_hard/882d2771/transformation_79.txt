===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize values computed during recursion to avoid redundant calculations and accelerate computation.

Consider a state (i, j) where i is the number of groups and j is the maximum number of girls per group. Define the state as a tuple (n, k) where n is the remaining number of girls and k is the current group size.
Memoize function calls by storing previously computed values in a dictionary with key-value pairs (i, j) -> f(i, j).

To calculate f(i, j), we can recursively call the function for i - 1 groups with j - 1 girls per group, and then add the comparison cost of selecting the most beautiful girl from the current group.

Update memoized values in-place to avoid redundant calculations.

Iterate over all possible states (i, j) within the given constraints, starting from the base case (1, 1), until reaching the target state (t, r).

For each state, use the memoized value f(i - 1, j - 1) and add the comparison cost of selecting the most beautiful girl from the current group to compute the final value.

Finally, calculate the expression t0·f(l) + t1·f(l + 1) + ... + tr - l·f(r) modulo 109 + 7 using the memoized values.
