The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

To use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach and fill up a table dp[i] with the minimal total comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from i girls, where 0 ≤ i ≤ r. However, we should calculate dp[i] based on the number of groups in the beauty contest, not just adding 1 or multiplying by t.

We can use another dynamic programming array, grp[i], which represents the minimal total comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from i girls, considering that they are divided into i-1 groups. Then, f(n) = 1 + min(grp[k] for k in range(2, n)) if n is even, or t * min(grp[k] for k in range(2, n//t+1)) if n is odd.

The correct dynamic programming recurrence relations are:

- dp[i] = 1 + min(dp[j] for j in range(2, i))
- dp[i] = t * min(dp[j] for j in range(2, i//t+1))

The base case would be dp[0] = 0 and dp[1] = 1.

Finally, we can calculate the total minimal comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from r girls by calculating f(r) - l·f(r), considering that t0·f(l) + t1·f(l+1) + ... + tr is already calculated in dp[r].

The updated plan is:
