===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the values in a bottom-up manner using dynamic programming to build up the solution from base cases.

State: dp[i][j] represents the minimum total number of comparisons required to select the most beautiful girl from i groups with j participants each.
dp[0][j] = 0 for all j (base case, since there are no groups)
dp[i][1] = 1 for all i (base case, since only one participant is left in each group)

State Transition: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + dp[1][j-k]) for k in range(j);
This step represents the selection process where we choose the most beautiful girl from i groups with j participants and recursively apply the same process to the remaining groups.

Memoization: Use a dictionary to store the computed values and look up previously computed ones.
Store the intermediate results in dp[i][j] and return the value when it's needed instead of recalculating it every time.
This optimization will greatly reduce the computation time and make the algorithm more efficient.
