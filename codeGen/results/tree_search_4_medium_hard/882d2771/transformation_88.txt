===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize values computed during recursion to avoid redundant calculations and accelerate computation.
The state is (r, k), where f(r) represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from r girls with at most k pairs of identical clothes.
f(0, r) = 0 for any r
f(k, r) = min(f(l, min(r - l + k, k)) + (r - l) for l from 0 to k)
Use dynamic programming to build up solutions for smaller subproblems and store them in an array.
Store the memoized values in a 2D array dp[k][r] where dp[k][r] represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from r girls with at most k pairs of identical clothes.
Initialize dp[0][r] = 0 for any r
Calculate dp[k][r] using the formula above and store it in the array.
