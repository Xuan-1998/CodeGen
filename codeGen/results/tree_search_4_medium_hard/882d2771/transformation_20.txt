===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

f(2n) = f(n) + f(n)

dp[i] = min(dp[j] + dp[k]) for all j, k such that 1 <= j < i and l <= k < r

Let's break down the recurrence relation:
- For n even, f(n) can be calculated as the minimum of f(n/2) + f(n/2)
- If n is odd, f(n) can be calculated as the minimum of f((n+1)/2) + f((n-1)/2)

Combine these two cases:

dp[i] = min(dp[j] + dp[k]) for all j, k such that 1 <= j < i and l <= k < r

Start by calculating f(n) for n from largest to smallest.

Initialize a table dp[] of size (r - l + 1) × t filled with infinity.

For each girl's group size n:
- Calculate f(n) by iterating over all subgroups sizes m such that l <= m <= n
  - For each subgroup size m, calculate the minimum number of comparisons required to select the most beautiful participant from a group of m girls.
  - Update dp[n] with this value.

Finally, return t0·f(l) + t1·f(l + 1) + ... + tr - l·f(r) modulo 109 + 7.
