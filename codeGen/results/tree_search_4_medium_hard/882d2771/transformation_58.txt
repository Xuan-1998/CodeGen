===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

f(2n+1) = f(n) + 1
f(2n) = f(n) + n

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by iteratively calculating f(i) for i from l to r and then use the calculated values to compute the final result. However, we need to consider that the function value f(i) depends on the parity of i.

For even i, f(i) can be calculated as f(i/2) + (i/2), since we can divide the problem into two smaller instances.

For odd i, f(i) can be calculated as f((i+1)/2) + 1, since we can select one girl from the group and then solve the problem for the remaining girls.

Initialize an array dp of size r-l+1 with all values set to -1. Then, iterate from l to r in reverse order. For each i, calculate f(i) based on its parity and update the value in the dp array. Finally, return the sum of t0·f(l) + t1·f(l+1) + ... + tr - l·f(r) modulo 109 + 7.
