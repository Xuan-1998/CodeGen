===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the values in a bottom-up manner using dynamic programming to build up the solution from base cases.

State: dp[i][j] represents the minimum total number of comparisons required to select the most beautiful girl from i groups with j participants each.

dp[1][j] = j - 1, for all 2 ≤ j ≤ r, since we need to compare all girls in one group.
For i > 1 and 2 ≤ j ≤ r:
    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + (j-k+1)) for k in range(2, j+1);
    Store the computed value of dp[i][j] in a dictionary to enable memoization.
For t iterations:
    Calculate the value of the expression: t0·f(l) + t1·f(l + 1) + ... + tr - l·f(r), modulo 109 + 7;
    Print the calculated value as the output.
