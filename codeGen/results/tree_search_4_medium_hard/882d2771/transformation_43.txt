===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.
base case: f(1) = 0
The problem can be viewed as a sequence of comparisons, each comparison reducing the number of girls by half. Then, we can formulate state and transition relationships as:
f(n) = min(f(n/2) + 1) for all n > 1
Designing a stateful transition function
We need to handle edge cases: f(2) = 1 (only one comparison needed to select the most beautiful participant)
The plan is correct, but it's missing some crucial details. We should specify how we will store and update our dynamic programming table.
We can use an array dp[n] where dp[i] represents the minimum total number of pairwise comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from i girls in a beauty contest.
We fill up this array iteratively, starting from f(1) = 0, using the recurrence relation: dp[i] = min(dp[i/2] + 1) for all i > 1
Finally, we return dp[r]
