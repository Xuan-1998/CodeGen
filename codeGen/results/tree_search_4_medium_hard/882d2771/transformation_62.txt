The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.
base case: f(1) = 0
The state is the current number of girls, and the transition is when we select one girl from each group. 
Another option is to use memoization within a recursive function that calculates f(n). This approach relies on storing the intermediate results of smaller instances to avoid redundant calculations.
When selecting one girl from each group, the problem size decreases by 1, so we can calculate f(m) for m < n and then add the result.
We can maintain an array dp where dp[i] represents the minimum number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from i girls. 
The recurrence relation is: dp[i] = min(dp[j] + (i - j)) for all j in range(1, i).
To avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency, we can use dynamic programming with memoization.
