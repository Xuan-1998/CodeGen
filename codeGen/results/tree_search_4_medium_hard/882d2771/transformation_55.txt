===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.
f(2n+1) = f(n) + 1 (since we need one more comparison to select the most beautiful participant from an even number of girls)
Use a 2D DP array dp[n][2] where:
    - dp[i][0] represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from i girls when the girls are divided into groups with at most one girl in each group.
    - dp[i][1] represents the minimum total number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from i girls when the girls are not necessarily divided into groups (i.e., we can compare them directly).

dp[2][0] = 0 (no comparison needed for two girls)
For n > 2:
    - dp[n][0] = min(dp[i][1] + 1) where i is an odd number less than or equal to n-1, and the minimum is taken over all such i.
    - dp[n][1] = min(min(dp[i][0], dp[j][1]) + n/2 - n) where i and j are integers satisfying i <= j <= n and i and j are not both even. The minimum is taken over all such i and j.

The final answer is f(r) - lÂ·f(r) modulo 109 + 7, which can be calculated using the DP array.
