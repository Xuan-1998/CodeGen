===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

f(2n+1) = f(n) + 1
f(n) = f(n-1) + 1 if n is odd, and f(n/2) + n/2 - n otherwise

Implement memoization using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations. 

The plan seems correct in terms of identifying the optimal substructure. However, it may be improved by considering that the problem constraints state 2 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 5·106.

To handle this, we can pre-calculate f(n) for n = 2 to 5·106 and store the results in a dictionary. This way, when calculating f(r), we only need to consider subproblems up to 5·106.

The plan does not explicitly include edge cases. However, it seems that the edge cases are handled naturally by the recursive formulae and memoization.
