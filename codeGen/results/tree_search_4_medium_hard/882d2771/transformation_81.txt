===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize values computed during recursion to avoid redundant calculations and accelerate computation.

Consider a state (i, j) where i is the number of groups and j is the maximum number of girls per group. Define the state as a tuple (i, j).

State: (n, k, g) where n is the remaining number of girls, k is the current group size, and g is the current girl's beauty.

Memoizing f(n) values for given l
Calculate f(1) = 0, since only one girl remains.
For i from 2 to r:
    For each possible group size j in [l, r]:
        Calculate f(i) as the minimum of the maximum number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from each group of girls with k-1 girls and g+1 beauty for all k in [1, j] and the sum of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from one girl and the remaining girls.
        Store f(i) in memo array.

Calculate t0·f(l) + t1·f(l + 1) + ... + tr - l·f(r) modulo 109 + 7
