===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n.

To calculate f(n), we need to consider two cases: when l = 1 and when l > 1. If l = 1, then f(n) = n - 1 because we need to compare every girl except the most beautiful one. If l > 1, then f(n) = 1 + min(f(l-1), f(n-l)), where the minimum is taken over all possible partitions of girls into groups.

dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + 1, i - dp[i-1]) // incorrect calculation

We can use a dynamic programming array dp to store the values of f(n). Initialize dp[0] = 0 and dp[1] = 1. Then for each n > 1:
    if l = 1, then dp[n] = n - 1
    else dp[n] = 1 + min(dp[l-1], dp[n-l])

Finally, calculate the value of the expression t0·f(l) + t1·f(l+1) + ... + tr - l·f(r), calculated modulo 109 + 7.
