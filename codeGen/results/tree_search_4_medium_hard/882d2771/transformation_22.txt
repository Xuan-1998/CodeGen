The optimal substructure is that f(n) can be calculated by combining the results of smaller instances, specifically f(m) for m < n. This observation leads us to use dynamic programming.

To further refine our approach, we can think about how to calculate f(2n). Since f(n) gives us the minimum number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from n girls, f(2n) should be the minimum number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from 2n girls. We can break this down into two parts: selecting the most beautiful participant from the first n girls and then selecting the most beautiful participant from the remaining n girls.

We can model this using dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach. Let dp[i] be the minimum number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from i girls. We can update dp[i] as follows:

dp[i] = min(dp[j] + f(k)) for all j, k such that 1 <= j < i and l <= k < r

This formula says that the minimum number of comparisons needed to select the most beautiful participant from i girls is the minimum over all possible ways of splitting i into two parts, with one part having k girls (l <= k < r), and the other part having j girls (1 <= j < i). The total number of comparisons is then f(k) + dp[j].

Finally, we can use this formula to calculate f(r) as our final answer.
