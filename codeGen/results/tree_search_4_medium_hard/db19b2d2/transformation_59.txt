===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether this problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm, where you start by selecting the most promising department and then iteratively add players until the team is complete. This might involve some form of sorting or priority queue.

Base case: If the total number of players from all departments is less than n, then there's no way to form a team with at least one player from the department of interest.

State: Consider a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the probability that we can form a team with at least one player from the department of interest using the first i players, and considering only j departments so far.

dp[i][j] = (s[h] / sum(si for si in s)) * (1 - dp[i-1][j-1]) + dp[i-1][j]

Edge cases: If m < h or h > m or any si is 0, return -1. If i < n and j == m, return 1.
