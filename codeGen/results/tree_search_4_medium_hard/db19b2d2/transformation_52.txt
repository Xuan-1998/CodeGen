===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether this problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm, where you start by selecting the most promising department and then iteratively add players until the team is complete. However, since the number of departments in a university (m) could potentially exceed 100, a greedy approach might not work efficiently.
The state could be a pair (i, k) representing the current department i and the number of players from that department already selected k. This approach can account for the cumulative probability of having at least one player from the department of interest.
The transition relationship could be formulated based on the idea of choosing the next player from the current department or moving to the next department, considering whether the team is complete or not.

To further optimize this approach:
- Calculate the total number of players available in all departments and compare it with the target team size. If there are insufficient players, output -1.
- Iterate through each department, calculating the probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the current department given k players selected so far.

The updated version of the plan is as follows:
