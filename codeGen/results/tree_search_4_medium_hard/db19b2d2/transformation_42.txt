===BEGIN PLAN===
The initial approach is correct in modeling this problem as a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variable representing the number of players from the department of interest.

To improve the plan:

1. **Calculate the PMF**: Calculate the probability mass function (PMF) for each possible outcome (number of players from the department of interest). This can be done using the binomial distribution, as we are considering a fixed-size team and the number of basketball players in each department.
2. **Use the 2D array approach**: Implement the 2D array approach to calculate the probability of having at least one player from the department of interest given that we have chosen k players and are currently considering the i-th department. This can be done using dynamic programming, where each cell represents the probability calculated in step 1.
3. **Calculate the CDF**: Calculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the number of players from the department of interest by summing the probabilities for all possible outcomes greater than or equal to 1.

To handle edge cases:

* Ensure that the input values are within the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1,000, 1 ≤ h ≤ m, 1 ≤ si ≤ 100).
* Handle the case where there are not enough basketball players in the university to form a team. In this case, return -1.

The updated plan is as follows:
