===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be modeled as a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variable representing the number of players from the department of interest.

Base case: When there are no more players to choose from (k = n-1), we need to check if there are any players from the department of interest. This is represented by the probability P[n-1] being greater than or equal to 1.

Transition relationship: The probability P[k] is the sum of probabilities for all possible outcomes greater than or equal to 1, where k is the number of players chosen so far. This can be calculated as:

P[k] = sum(P[i]) for i in range(k+1, n) and s_i >= 1

where si is the number of basketball players in the i-th department.

Memoization: We apply memoization to the recursive function by storing intermediate results in a dictionary and checking for their existence before recalculating them. This can be represented as:

memo = {}

def P(k):
    if k in memo:
        return memo[k]
    if k == n-1:
        return sum(1 if s_h >= 1 else 0) / n
    result = sum(P(i) for i in range(k+1, n) if si >= 1)
    memo[k] = result
    return result
