===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether this problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming instead of Greedy Algorithm, as there might be overlapping subproblems that can be computed and stored once.

The state could be a 2D array dp where each cell [i][j] represents the probability that a randomly formed team with i players will have at least one player from the j-th department. The transition relationship would be the calculation of dp[i][j] based on dp[i-1][k] for all departments k, including the j-th department.

Using this approach, we iterate over all possible values of i and j, calculating the probability of having at least one player from each department as we go along. We only need to store the results in the current row, as they are not dependent on previous rows.

This plan does include edge cases: if there are not enough basketball players in the university to form a team, output -1 instead.
