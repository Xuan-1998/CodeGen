===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem by modeling it as a recursive formula.

Let's define P[k] as the probability that a randomly formed team with k players will have at least one player from the department of interest. We'll use a 2D array dp to store the probabilities for each number of players and each cumulative sum.

The base case is when there are no more players to choose from (k = n-1), in which case we just need to check if there are any players from the department of interest.

We can model the problem as a recursive formula:

P[k] = Σ (P[i-1] * (si / (n-i+1))) where i ranges from h to min(h+k-1, n)

The idea is that we're choosing a player from the department of interest with probability si / (n-i+1) for each possible outcome i, and then recursively calculating the probability P[i-1] for the remaining players.

To avoid redundant calculations, we can store the intermediate results in the dp array. The dynamic programming formula would be:

dp[k][cumulative_sum] = Σ (P[i-1] * (si / (n-i+1))) where i ranges from h to min(h+k-1, n) and cumulative_sum is the sum of players chosen so far.

The final answer would be the probability P[n-1], which represents the probability that a randomly formed team with n players will have at least one player from the department of interest.

We'll also need to handle edge cases where there are not enough basketball players in the university to form a team, and return -1 in such cases.
