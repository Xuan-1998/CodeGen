===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether this problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm, where you start by selecting the most promising department and then iteratively add players until the team is complete. This might involve some form of sorting or priority queue. However, upon further consideration, it seems that this approach would not guarantee an optimal solution.

Base case: If the total number of players from all departments is less than n, then there's no way to form a team with at least one player from the department of interest. This case can be handled separately and does not require any dynamic programming.

State: Let dp[i] represent the probability that a randomly formed team of size i will have at least one player from the department of interest. The state will be represented by the current index into this array, and the transition will depend on whether we choose a player from the current department or not.

Transition function: If we include a player from the current department in the team, then the probability is increased by the ratio of players in that department to the total number of players. If we do not include a player from the current department, then the probability remains the same as the previous state.

Memoize the function that calculates the probability of having at least one player from the department of interest, given the number of players in each department and the total team size.
