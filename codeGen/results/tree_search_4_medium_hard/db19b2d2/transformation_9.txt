dp[i][j] = 1 if (sum(s[k] for k in range(m) if k!=h) >= i-j+1) + dp[i-1][j-1] if i>0 and j>0

Top-down dynamic programming:
Calculate the probability for each possible number of players from the department of interest, starting with i=1.
For each possible i, calculate the probability that there are at least i players from the department of interest in a randomly formed team of size j.
Store these probabilities in a dictionary or memoization table dp.

Calculate the final answer as follows:
For each possible j, calculate the probability that there is at least one player from the department of interest in a randomly formed team of size j.
Use the stored probabilities in dp to compute this final answer.
