===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a dynamic programming approach where the state represents the number of players from the department of interest, and the transitions represent the addition of new players to the team. This could be solved using either top-down memoization or bottom-up tabulation.

dp[i] = probability(dp[h-1]) + sum(probability(j) for j in range(h, i+1)) * (1 - probability(h-1))
for i in range(n)

The state represents the current number of players on the team, and the transition is determined by whether the new player is from the department of interest or not. The dynamic programming approach involves defining a function dp(i) that returns the probability of having at least one player from the department of interest given i players on the team.

This plan takes into account the edge case where there are not enough basketball players in the university to form a team, and outputs -1 instead.
