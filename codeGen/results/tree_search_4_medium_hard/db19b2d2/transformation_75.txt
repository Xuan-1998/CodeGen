The initial approach seems correct in recognizing the problem as a dynamic programming problem. The state could indeed be the number of players that have been randomly chosen so far, and the transition relationship would be the addition of another random player to the team.

However, there is a more efficient way to solve this problem using binary search instead of dynamic programming. This approach involves calculating the cumulative sum of the number of basketball players in each department and then performing a binary search on these sums to find the first sum that exceeds or equals the total number of players required for the team.

The state could be the index of the current department, and the transition relationship would be incrementing this index by 1. The final answer would be the probability that the randomly formed team will have at least one player from the department of interest, which can be calculated using the binary search result.
