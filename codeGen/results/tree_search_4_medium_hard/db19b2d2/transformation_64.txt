===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether this problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming (DP). The basic idea is to use an array dp to keep track of the probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the department of interest up to the current index.

Base case: If the total number of players from all departments is less than n, then there's no way to form a team with at least one player from the department of interest. In this case, return -1 as the result.

State: Let's use an array count to keep track of the number of basketball players in each department. The state will be represented by the current index into this array, and the transition will depend on whether we choose a player from the current department or not.

Transition function: For each index i, calculate the probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the department of interest up to the ith department. This can be done by calculating the sum of probabilities that there is at least one player from the department of interest in any of the first i departments and the remaining (n-i) players do not come from this department.

DP function: dp[i] = 1 - product((count[j] / s) for j in range(i)) * (1 - dp[i-1]) if count[h] > 0 else -1

Return dp[n-1] as the result. This is because we want to find the probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the department of interest, and this is exactly what dp[n-1] gives us.
