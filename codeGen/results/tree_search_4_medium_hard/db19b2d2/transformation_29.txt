===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about modeling this problem as a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variable representing the number of players from the department of interest. This could involve calculating the probability mass function (PMF) and then taking the sum of the probabilities for all possible outcomes greater than or equal to 1.
Let the state be a tuple (i, k) where i is the current department and k is the number of players chosen so far. The base case is when all departments have been visited (i = m).
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with a 2D array dp[i][k] where dp[i][k] represents the probability that the k-th player chosen comes from the department of interest and i is the current department.
The transition equation for state (i, k) would be: dp[i][k] = (s_i / total_players) * dp[i-1][k] + (1 - s_i / total_players) * (1 - sum(dp[j][k-1]) for j in range(i))
where i is the current department and k is the number of players chosen so far. The base case is when all departments have been visited (i = m).
The final answer would be: 1 - sum(dp[m][n] for n in range(n)) where n is the total number of players.
