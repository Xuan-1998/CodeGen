===BEGIN PLAN===
To calculate the probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the department of interest, we can use dynamic programming.

Let dp[i][j] be the probability that a team of size j has at least one player from the i-th department. We want to find dp[m-1][n].

The transition is as follows:
- If there are enough players in the i-th department to form a team, then we have two options: either include no players from this department (dp[i-1][j]) or include at least one player from this department (dp[i-1][j-n_i]). We take the maximum of these two probabilities.
- If there are not enough players in the i-th department to form a team, then we can only include no players from this department (dp[i-1][j]).
We calculate dp[0][k] for all k and then use these values to calculate dp[i][j] for all i and j.

Here is the step-by-step plan:
