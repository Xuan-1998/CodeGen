===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether this problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach, where you build up solutions to smaller subproblems and combine them to solve larger problems.

The state could be a tuple (i, j), representing the current team size i and the number of departments seen j. The transition relationship would involve updating this probability based on whether or not we have selected a player from each department in the last iteration.

Create a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the probability that a team of size i will contain at least one player from the first j departments.

To avoid overcounting, add a base case to handle teams with fewer players than the number of departments. Initialize this base case to false (i.e., no department has been seen yet).

For larger teams, iterate through each department and update the probability based on whether or not we have selected a player from that department.

Finally, return dp[n][m], where n is the total team size and m is the number of departments. If there are not enough basketball players in the university to form a team, output -1 instead.
