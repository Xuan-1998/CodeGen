===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether this problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming (DP), where you start by calculating the number of ways to form a team without considering the department of interest.

The state could be a pair (i, k) representing the current department i and the number of players from that department already selected k. The transition from one state to another would be when you select or do not select a player from the current department.

Consider a state as a tuple (d, n), where d is the current department and n is the total number of basketball players from that department already selected.

Tabulate the solutions for each possible number of departments and the total number of players. You can use a 2D array dp[m][n] to store the results, where m is the maximum number of departments and n is the maximum number of players.

For each state (i, k), you calculate the probability that the team formed so far does not contain at least one player from the department of interest. This would be 1 - P(h, k) / C(k).

The base case would be when i = h, where you have already considered the department of interest.

The recurrence relation would be: dp[i][k] = (1 - P(h, k) / C(k)) * sum(dp[j][k-j] for j in range(1, i)) + dp[h-1][k]

To calculate the final answer, you take the maximum probability from all states where the total number of players is equal to or greater than n.
