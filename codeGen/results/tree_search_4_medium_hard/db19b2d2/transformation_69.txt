===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether this problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming.

The state could be a tuple (dp_interest, dp_total), where:
  - dp_interest is true if we have seen the department of interest or false otherwise
  - dp_total is the total number of departments that are already represented on the team

The transition relationship would be:
  - If we add a new department and it's not the department of interest: (false, dp_total + 1)
  - If we add a new department and it's the department of interest: (true, dp_total + 1)

Calculating the probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the department of interest:
  - Count the number of teams that satisfy this condition
  - Divide it by the total number of possible teams

The base case would be when we are adding the last department. We can calculate the probability in constant time based on the state.

We need to add a check for edge cases, such as if there are not enough basketball players in the university to form a team.
