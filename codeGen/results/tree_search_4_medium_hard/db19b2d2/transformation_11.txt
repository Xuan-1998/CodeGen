===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a dynamic programming approach where the state represents the number of players from the department of interest, and the transitions represent the addition of new players to the team.

Let dp[i] be the probability that after selecting i players, there is at least one player from the department of interest. The base case would be when i = 0, then dp[0] = 1 if h > 0 (since we need at least one player from the department of interest), and dp[0] = 0 otherwise.

For i > 0, consider two cases:
- If the i-th player is from the department of interest, then there are two possibilities: either they are included in the team or not. The probability that they are included is s[h]/(sum(s)), where sum(s) is the total number of players. The probability that they are not included is 1 - s[h]/(sum(s)). Since we only care about the probability that there is at least one player from the department of interest, we can ignore the case when they are not included and just consider the probability when they are.

- If the i-th player is not from the department of interest, then there are two possibilities: either the team already has at least one player from the department of interest or not. The probability that the team already has at least one player from the department of interest is dp[i-1] (since we already know the team has at least one player from the department of interest). The probability that the team does not have at least one player from the department of interest is 1 - dp[i-1].

The transition relationships can be formulated as:
dp[i] = min(1, s[h]/(sum(s)) + (1 - s[h]/(sum(s))) * dp[i-1]) if i-th player is from the department of interest
dp[i] = 0 otherwise

This approach ensures that we correctly calculate the probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the department of interest.
