===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about modeling this problem as a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variable representing the number of players from the department of interest. This could involve calculating the probability mass function (PMF) and then taking the sum of the probabilities for all possible outcomes greater than or equal to 1.

Let's break it down into smaller steps:

* Initialize a dictionary memo{(i, k): p} where memo[(i, k)] is the probability that the k-th player chosen comes from the department of interest, considering all departments up to i.
* Calculate the base case: when all departments have been visited (i = m). In this case, the probability of choosing a player from the department of interest is simply the number of players in that department divided by the total number of players. So, memo[(m, n)] = s_h / n.
* For each department i < m and for each number of players k < n:
    + Calculate the probability that the k-th player chosen comes from the current department i: p = si / (sum of all si up to i).
    + Update the memo dictionary: memo[(i, k)] = 1 - (product of probabilities of choosing a player not from the current department up to k-1) * p.
* The final answer is the probability that at least one player chosen comes from the department of interest: sum of all memo[(m, n)] where n >= 1.
* If there are not enough basketball players in the university to form a team, output -1 instead.

This plan should work correctly and handle edge cases. The only potential issue is that it might be slow for large inputs due to the number of dictionary lookups. However, this can be mitigated by using a more efficient data structure or algorithm.
