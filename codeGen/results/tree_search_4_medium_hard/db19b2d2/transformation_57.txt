===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether this problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming (DP), as it seems more suitable for this problem.

The state could be a tuple (i, k) representing the current department i and the number of players from that department already selected k. The transition relationship could be based on the idea of adding a new player to the team or stopping when the team size reaches n.

We can use memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant computations while building up the probability table.

To improve the plan, we should consider edge cases, such as what happens if there are not enough basketball players in the university to form a team. In this case, we should output -1 instead of calculating the probability.

Here is the updated version of the plan:
