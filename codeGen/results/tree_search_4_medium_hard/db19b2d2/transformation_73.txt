===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether this problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm, where you start by selecting the most promising department and then iteratively add players until the team is complete. This might involve some form of sorting or priority queue.

The state could be a binary value indicating whether we have seen the department of interest or not. This would be true if we have seen it and false otherwise.

However, this approach may not work as there are cases where you cannot select the most promising department (e.g., when you already have players from that department).

Instead, use dynamic programming to create a 2D table where each cell represents the probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the department of interest, given the number of players already chosen and the current department.

The state could be the current department index and the number of players selected so far. The transition relationship would be the addition of another random player to the team (either from the current department or not).

To improve this plan:
- Consider sorting the departments based on their sizes before making any calculations.
- Initialize a 2D table where each cell represents the probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the department of interest, given the number of players already chosen and the current department.

Potential issues with the plan:
- What if there are not enough basketball players in the university to form a team? How do we handle this edge case?
- What if some departments have more than 100 players?
