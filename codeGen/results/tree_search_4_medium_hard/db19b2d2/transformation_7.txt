===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a dynamic programming approach where the state represents the number of players from the department of interest, and the transitions represent the addition of new players to the team. This could be solved using either top-down memoization or bottom-up tabulation.

dp[i][j] = 1 if any(s[k] >= i-j+1 for k in range(m) if k!=h else False) + dp[i-1][j-1] if i>0 and j>0

Top-down dynamic programming: calculate the probability for each possible number of players from the department of interest and store it in a dictionary or memoization table, then use these stored probabilities to compute the final answer.

For edge cases:
- If there are not enough basketball players in the university to form a team (i.e., n > sum(s)), output -1 instead.
- Initialize dp[0][j] = 0 and dp[i][0] = 1 for i > 0, as the probability of having at least one player from the department of interest is zero when there are no players on the team.

The plan looks good in terms of approach. It could be improved by adding more detail to each step and edge cases.
