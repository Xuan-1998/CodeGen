===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether this problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm, where you start by selecting the most promising department and then iteratively add players until the team is complete. This might involve some form of sorting or priority queue.

The state could be a binary value indicating whether we have seen the department of interest or not. This would be true if we have seen it and false otherwise.
The transition relationship would be the addition of a new department to the team, where we check if it is the department of interest. If it is, then we update our state to true.

The goal is to minimize the number of departments required to guarantee at least one representative from the department of interest.
