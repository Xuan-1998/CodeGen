1. Determine whether this problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm, where you start by selecting the most promising department and then iteratively add players until the team is complete. This might involve some form of sorting or priority queue.

 Correctness: The greedy approach seems plausible as we want to maximize the chance of including at least one player from the department of interest. However, it's not guaranteed that this approach will always find the optimal solution.

2. The state could be a pair (i, k) representing the current department i and the number of players from that department already selected k.

 Correctness: This is a correct representation of the state space. We need to keep track of both the current department and the total number of players selected so far.

3. The transition relationship could be based on the idea of adding a new player to the team or stopping when the team size reaches n.

 Correctness: The transition relation seems correct as we either add a new player or stop when the team size reaches n.

4. A tabulation approach involves creating a 1D array where each cell t[k] represents the minimum number of players needed to guarantee that there is at least one player from the department of interest after selecting k players in total.

 Correctness: This seems like the correct approach as we want to find the minimum number of players required to guarantee inclusion of at least one player from the department of interest. The tabulation approach ensures that this value is calculated for each possible total number of players.

5. We start by initializing t[0] = 0, indicating that selecting no players guarantees including at least one player from the department of interest (since we didn't select any yet).

 Correctness: This initialization seems correct as selecting zero players means we didn't select anyone, so it's guaranteed to include at least one player from the department of interest.

6. Then for each i from 1 to m, and each k from 0 to n-1, calculate t[k] = min{t[k-1], 1 + s_i}, where si is the number of players in the i-th department.

 Correctness: This transition relation seems correct as we either choose not to select any player from the current department (by taking the minimum with t[k-1]) or add one more player from the current department (by adding 1 + si). The minimum ensures that we choose the option that guarantees including at least one player from the department of interest.

7. Finally, calculate the answer as 1 - exp(-sum(t[i] for i in range(h+1)))/n), where h is the department of interest and the sum is taken over all departments up to and including the department of interest.

 Correctness: The calculation seems correct as we want to find the probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the department of interest. We subtract the cumulative probability of not selecting any players from the department of interest from 1, then divide by n to normalize the probability.
