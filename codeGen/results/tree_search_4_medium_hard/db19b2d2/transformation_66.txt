===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether this problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming. Yes, it's possible.

Base case: If the total number of players from all departments is less than n, then there's no way to form a team with at least one player from the department of interest. This ensures that we only consider valid team formation possibilities.

State: Define dp as a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the probability that the team formed with i players will have at least one player from the j-th department.
Implement memoization by creating a dictionary where the keys are the subproblems (i, j) and the values are the corresponding results. This way, you can avoid redundant calculations and directly retrieve the result when needed.

Initialize dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, because there's no team formed with 0 players.
dp[i][h] represents the probability that a team of size i will have at least one player from the department of interest. If s_h >= i, then we're guaranteed to get at least one player from the department of interest.

For i = 1 to n:
    For j = 1 to m:
        if j == h: dp[i][j] = min(1, (s_j + dp[i-1][j]) / s_j)
        else: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], 1 - (s_j + dp[i-1][h]) / s_j)

Return dp[n][h]
