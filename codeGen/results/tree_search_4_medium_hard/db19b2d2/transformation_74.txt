===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether this problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming, as you initially thought. The approach would involve creating a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the probability that we have at least one player from the department of interest given that we have already selected i players and seen j departments.

The state could be the number of players that have been randomly chosen so far, which would be used to transition to the next state. The transition relationship would be the addition of another random player to the team.

Memoization can be implemented by using a dictionary to store the probabilities calculated for smaller subproblems and reuse them when needed. This would significantly improve the time complexity of the solution.

To calculate the probability, we iterate through each department and add the probability that we have at least one player from the department given that we have already seen j departments to dp[i][j]. We then update dp[i+1][j] by adding the probability that we do not have any players from the department of interest given that we have already seen j departments.

Finally, we return dp[n][m], where n is the total number of players and m is the total number of departments. This would give us the overall probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the department of interest.
