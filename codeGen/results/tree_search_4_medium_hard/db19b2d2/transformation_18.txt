===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a dynamic programming approach where the state represents the number of players from the department of interest, and the transitions represent the addition of new players to the team. This could be solved using either top-down memoization or bottom-up tabulation.

state = 0, transitions = [any(si >= h for si in s) + ...]

The idea is to build up a probability distribution where each state represents the number of players from the department of interest and each transition represents the addition of a new player. The base case would be when there are no more players left to add (i.e., when i = n).

Consider the number of players left to add to the team as the state variable, where the state is incremented when a new player is added. The transition relationships could be formulated as:

dp[i] = 1 - (1 - p)^(n-i) if i-th player is from the department of interest
dp[i] = dp[i-1] otherwise

where p is the probability that a randomly selected player is from the department of interest.

Dynamic programming using dynamic programming optimization: Use a combination of bottom-up tabulation and top-down memoization to solve the problem.

To improve the plan, consider including edge cases such as when there are not enough basketball players in the university to form a team. This could be handled by checking if n is greater than or equal to the total number of players (i.e., sum(s) for s in s). If so, return -1.0.

The updated plan includes edge cases and handles the base case correctly.
