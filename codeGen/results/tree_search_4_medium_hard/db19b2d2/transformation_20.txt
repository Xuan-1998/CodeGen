===BEGIN PLAN===
Let's break down the plan step by step:

1. **Modeling the problem**: We can model this problem as a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variable representing the number of players from the department of interest.

2. **Calculating the probability mass function (PMF)**: To calculate the PMF, we need to find the probability that exactly k players are selected from departments other than the department of interest, given the total number of players n and the number of basketball players in each department s1, ..., sm.
This can be done by using the hypergeometric distribution. The probability of selecting k items out of n items, where k is at most m, is:

P(X=k) = (s1 + ... + sm choose k) / (n choose k)

3. **Filling in the table**: We need to fill in a table where the rows represent the department of interest and the columns represent the number of players from departments other than the department of interest.

Let the state be a tuple (d, k) where d is the department of interest and k is the number of players from departments other than the department of interest. The transitions would represent adding a player to the team, updating the number of players from departments other than the department of interest, and checking if this adds up to at least one player from the department of interest.

4. **Base cases**: We need to handle the base cases where k is 0 or less. In these cases, we can simply return the probability that there are at least h basketball players in the department of interest, since adding more players would not change the outcome.

5. **Filling in the table using dynamic programming**: We fill in the table by iterating over all possible values of k and d. For each state (d, k), we calculate the cumulative probability that there are at least one player from the department of interest given that exactly k players are selected from departments other than the department of interest.

6. **Returning the answer**: Finally, we return the cumulative probability for the last row in the table, which corresponds to the case where all n players have been selected and at least one player is from the department of interest.
