===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a dynamic programming approach where the state represents the number of players from the department of interest, and the transitions represent the addition of new players to the team.

state = 0
transitions = [dp[i-1] + (1 if si > state else 0) for i, si in enumerate(s, start=1)]

The key insight is that the probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the department of interest is equivalent to the probability that no such player will be selected. This can be calculated by finding the number of ways to select players without choosing any from the department of interest.

To do this, consider a bottom-up tabulation approach where dp[i] represents the number of ways to select i players from the university departments without selecting any from the department of interest. The transition relationships could be formulated as: dp[i] = sum(dp[j-1] * (m-j) for j in range(1, i+1)).

Then use this dynamic programming approach to calculate the probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the department of interest by subtracting the cumulative sum of dp[i] from 1 and dividing by the total number of ways to select players.
