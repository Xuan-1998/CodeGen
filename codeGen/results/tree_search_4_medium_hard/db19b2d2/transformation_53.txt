The initial intuition is correct that this problem can be solved using dynamic programming. Here's an improved and more detailed plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether this problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm, where you start by selecting the most promising department and then iteratively add players until the team is complete. This might involve some form of sorting or priority queue. 

The state could be a tuple (k, h), representing the current team size k and whether the current team has at least one player from the department of interest h.

Formulate the state as a tuple (k, h), where k is the current team size and h is 1 if the current team has at least one player from the department of interest, otherwise it's 0. 

Since this problem involves calculating probabilities, you could use dynamic programming with a state that keeps track of the probability of forming teams of different sizes.

To solve this problem, you can start by initializing a 2D array dp, where dp[i][j] represents the probability of forming a team of size i such that at least j players from the department of interest are included. 

Iterate through each possible number of players in the department of interest k from 1 to m, and for each k, calculate the total number of teams of size i that include at least one player from the department of interest.

To do this, iterate through each possible team size t from 0 to n, and for each t, calculate the probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the department of interest by considering all combinations of players that include exactly k players from the department of interest. 

Use dynamic programming to store the results in dp[i][j] and then return the value at dp[n][h].

This plan should correctly calculate the probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the department of interest.
