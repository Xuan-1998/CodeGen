===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][k] is the probability that we get at least one player from the department of interest after choosing k players from i-1 departments.

The base case would be dp[0][0] = 1, since there are no players chosen yet and the probability of getting at least one player from the department of interest is 100%.

For each i from 1 to m (number of departments), calculate the total number of players in the first i-1 departments. This can be represented as sum(s[j] for j in range(i)).

The transition rule would be dp[i][k] = 1 - (1 - p) * (1 - dp[i-1][k-1]), where p is the probability of getting at least one player from the department of interest if we choose one more player.

This is because the probability of not getting any players from the department of interest after choosing k players from i-1 departments is 1 - p, and this event is independent of the event that we don't get any players from the department of interest after choosing k-1 players from i-2 departments. The cumulative sum of these probabilities for all possible outcomes greater than or equal to 1 gives us dp[i][k].

The final answer would be dp[m][n], which represents the probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the department of interest.

This plan considers edge cases such as when there are not enough basketball players in the university to form a team.
