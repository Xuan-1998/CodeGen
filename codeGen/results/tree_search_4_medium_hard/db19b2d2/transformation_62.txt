===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether this problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming instead. The greedy algorithm approach might not work as there's no clear ordering or priority for selecting departments.

Base case: If the total number of players from all departments is less than n, then there's no way to form a team with at least one player from the department of interest. This can be calculated by summing up the number of basketball players in each department (s1 + s2 + ... + sm).

State: Let dp[i] represent the probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the department of interest after considering the first i departments.

Transition: For each department, we need to calculate the probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the current department. This can be done by calculating the probability that the randomly selected player is from the current department (s_h / s_sum), where s_h is the number of basketball players in the department of interest and s_sum is the total number of basketball players considered so far.

Use dynamic programming to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations. The recurrence relation will be dp[i] = 1 - (n-1) * (1 - dp[i-1]) / i, where n is the total number of players needed for a team, i is the current department index, and dp[i-1] is the probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the previous departments.

Edge cases: If there are not enough basketball players in the university to form a team (n > s_sum), output -1 instead. Otherwise, calculate the final probability as 1 - dp[m], where m is the total number of departments.
