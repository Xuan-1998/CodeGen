===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether this problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm, where you start by selecting the most promising department and then iteratively add players until the team is complete. This might involve some form of sorting or priority queue.

Base case: If h = 1, then the probability is either 0 (if s1 < n) or 1 (if s1 >= n).

The state represents a subset of departments, with transitions based on the number of players in each department.

Dynamic programming:
Calculate probabilities for subsets of departments and use these to recursively calculate the probability that a randomly formed team will have at least one player from the department of interest.

Sort the departments by their size (number of players) in descending order.
Initialize a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the probability that a randomly formed team with i players will have at least one player from the first j departments.

For i = 0 to n:
    For j = 0 to m:
        If j == 0, dp[i][j] = 1 (base case: no departments)
        Else if s1 + ... + sj-1 < i, dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] (no players from the first j-1 departments, so probability is the same as not having at least one player from the first j-1 departments)
        Else:
            Calculate p1: Probability that a randomly formed team with i players will have at least one player from the first j departments and include at least one department other than the department of interest.
            Calculate p2: Probability that a randomly formed team with i players will not have any players from the first j-1 departments (i.e., they are all from the department of interest).
            dp[i][j] = 1 - p2 (probability that at least one player is from the department of interest)

Return dp[n][h]
