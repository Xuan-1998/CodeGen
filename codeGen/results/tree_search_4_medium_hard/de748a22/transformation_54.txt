===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem involves finding the minimal number of elements that can be removed from a given range of the array so that the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements is zero.

The state expression is dp[l][r] = The minimal number of elements that can be removed from the range [l, r] to make the sum of signs in the remaining elements zero.
dp[l][r] represents whether the substring from index l to r in the array can be extended to a common prefix/suffix with another string.

Use bottom-up tabulation by iterating over all possible ranges and updating dp based on whether the range is a valid solution or not. For each query, find the minimal number of elements that can be removed from the given range [l, r] to make the sum of signs in the remaining elements zero. This can be done by checking for every element in the range if it contributes positively or negatively to the sum and updating dp accordingly.
