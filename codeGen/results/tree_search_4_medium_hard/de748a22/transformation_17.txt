===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

The base case could be when i = 0 or j = 0, in which case there are no more elements to consider and thus no elements need to be removed.

Dynamic programming can be used by defining a DP array where the state is (i, j) representing the number of elements that need to be removed from the range [l, r] to get a sum of zero.

Create a 2D DP array dp[n][n] where dp[i][j] represents the minimal number of elements that can be removed from the range [1, j] to get a sign-variable sum of zero. Then, fill this array using bottom-up approach.

To do this, iterate over all possible ranges [l, r], and for each range, calculate the total sum of the signs within the range. If the sum is positive or negative, remove elements from the beginning and end of the range respectively to make it zero. The number of removed elements would be the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

For each query [l, r], find the minimal number of elements that can be removed in the range [1, l] and [r, n] separately using the DP array. Then, add these two numbers together to get the total number of elements that need to be removed for the given range.
