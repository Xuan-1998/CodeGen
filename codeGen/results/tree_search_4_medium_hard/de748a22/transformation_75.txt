===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem involves finding the minimum number of elements that can be removed from a given range of the array so that the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements is zero.

Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = True if it's possible to make the sign-variable sum zero by removing at most j-1 elements from the subarray from i to n, and False otherwise.

dp[i][j] = True if the ith element is a common prefix/suffix between two strings. Top-down approach with memoization can be applied.

Implement bottom-up dynamic programming using a tabulated array where each cell represents the solution to a subproblem, and the final answer is calculated by iterating through the table.
