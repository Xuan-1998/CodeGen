===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem involves finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given range of an array so that the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements is zero.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = 1 if the jth element in string i matches the jth element in another string, 0 if they don't match. This can be simplified as dp[i][j] denotes the minimum number of elements that need to be removed up to the ith element and within the range [l..r].

Let's analyze the state transitions:

- If the jth element is within the range [l..r], then we either remove it or don't remove it. The latter case will only occur when the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements is zero, which means that in this case, the maximum sign-variable sum up to the ith element (i.e., dp[i][j]) is equal to the minimum number of elements that need to be removed up to the ith element and within the range [l..r] (i.e., dp[min(i, r)][min(j, r)]).
- If the jth element is not within the range [l..r], then we only need to consider the maximum sign-variable sum up to the ith element and within the range [0..r] (i.e., dp[max(0, i-l+1)][max(0, j-l+1)]).

The final state transition equation would be:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[min(i, r)][min(j, r)], dp[max(0, i-l+1)][max(0, j-l+1)])

This plan does not include edge cases. However, it seems to be a correct approach.
