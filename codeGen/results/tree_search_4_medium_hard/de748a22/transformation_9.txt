===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

The state expression could be dp[i][j], representing the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the range [0, j] within the first i elements.
dp[i][j] represents the sign-variable sum of elements in the range [i-j+1, i-1], with transitions based on comparing signs within consecutive elements.

Memoize the process of checking the sign-variable sum within each subarray as follows:

    dp[i][0] = 0 (base case)
    For j from 1 to i:
        if arr[j-1] == arr[j]:  // same sign, no change
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]
        else:  // different signs, consider removing one
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j-1], 1 + dp[i-j-1][j-2])

The transition is based on the idea that if consecutive elements have the same sign, there's no need to remove anything. If they have different signs, we can either keep the current element and continue from the previous subarray or remove one of them and consider a smaller subproblem.

This plan seems correct in its approach. It captures the overlapping subproblems and memoizes the process correctly.
To improve the plan, it might be beneficial to further optimize the transitions by considering more than just the previous two elements. This could potentially reduce the number of subproblems or make the computation more efficient.

The plan does not include edge cases explicitly, but it can be adapted to handle them as needed. For example, if we consider a range that goes beyond the end of the array, we would need to adjust the transitions accordingly.
