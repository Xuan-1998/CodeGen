===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem requires building up the solution from smaller subproblems to larger ones. Tabulation is more applicable.

The state can be represented as (left, right, sign_sum), where left and right are the indices of the leftmost and rightmost elements in the subarray, respectively, and sign_sum is the sum of signs in this subarray.

The base case would be when the query range contains only one element. In that case, we need to consider the sign of the single element.

Use a 3D DP array with dimensions (n+1), (q+1), and 2 to store the minimum number of elements that can be removed for each query range.

Transitions are required to move from subproblems to larger ones. The transition rules would be:

- If the leftmost element in the subarray is positive, we need to remove all negative signs up to the point where the sign_sum becomes zero.
- Similarly, if the rightmost element in the subarray is negative, we need to remove all positive signs from that point until the sign_sum becomes zero.

The final answer would be the minimum number of elements that can be removed for each query range.
