===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

Let dp[i][j] represent the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the first i elements such that the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements is zero when considering all possible partitions of the elements into positive and negative groups, where j represents the current sign-variable sum (i.e., the sum of signs of elements up to index i-1).

Maintain a dynamic programming array dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the first i elements such that the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements is zero when considering all possible partitions of the elements into positive and negative groups, with j ranging from -(n-1)/2 to (n-1)/2.

Initially, dp[0][0] = 0. For each i from 1 to n and each j from -((n-1)/2) to ((n-1)/2), calculate dp[i][j] as the minimum of:

* dp[i-1][k-1] + (sign variable sum at k is negative)
* dp[i-1][k+1] + (sign variable sum at k is positive)

where k is such that sign variable sum up to index i-1 is j, and sign variable sum at k is the same as j.

The final answer will be the minimum value of dp[n][j], where j ranges from -((n-1)/2) to ((n-1)/2).
