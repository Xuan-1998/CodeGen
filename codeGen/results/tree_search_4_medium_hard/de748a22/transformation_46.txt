===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem requires building up the solution from smaller subproblems to larger ones. Tabulation is more applicable.

State: Initialize dp array with size (n+1) * (r+1) to store minimum removals for each prefix and query range.

For each query (l, r), find the minimum number of elements that can be removed within the given range [l,r] such that the sign sum is 0.
The base case would be when l=0 or r=n-1. Initialize dp[0][j] = 0 for all j and dp[i][r+1] = 0 for all i.

Consider a state where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of elements that can be removed within the range [i,j] such that the sign sum is 0.
For each query (l, r), calculate the cumulative sum of the sign values from i=l to j=r and find the first index k such that the cumulative sum changes sign. 
Use this information to calculate the minimum removals.

To improve the plan:

* Instead of iterating through all possible subarrays within [l,r], consider using a sliding window approach.
* Calculate the prefix sum for each query range and use it to avoid redundant calculations.
* Use a more efficient data structure such as a segment tree to store cumulative sums and improve query time complexity.

Potential issues with the plan:

* The current plan does not handle edge cases properly, especially when l=0 or r=n-1.
* It may require significant modifications to accommodate out-of-range queries (i.e., l > 0 or r < n-1).
* Calculating cumulative sums and finding sign changes can be computationally expensive.
