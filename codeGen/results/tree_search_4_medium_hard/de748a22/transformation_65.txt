===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves finding the minimal number of elements that can be removed from a given range of the array so that the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements is zero.

The state expression dp[i][j] = 1 if the jth element in string i matches the jth character in another string, 0 if they don't match. This represents the minimal number of elements that can be removed from the subarray [l..i] to make the sign-variable sum zero, considering only the signs of elements within this range.

The plan involves a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming and prefix sum calculation.

1. Initialize dp array with size n * q.
2. Calculate prefix sums for each query, denoted as ps[i]. For each query i, calculate ps[i] = signsum[0..l_i-1] - signsum[0..r_i-1].
3. Initialize dp[l][0] = 0 for all l. This represents the minimal number of elements that can be removed from the first range to make the sign-variable sum zero.
4. For each query i:
    a. Calculate dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], ps[i] + dp[i-1][j-1]) for j = 0..q_i.
    b. Update dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] - dp[i][0].
5. For each query i, return the minimal number of elements that can be removed from the range [l_i..r_i] to make the sign-variable sum zero.

The plan handles edge cases by considering all possible queries and ensuring that the dp array is correctly initialized.
