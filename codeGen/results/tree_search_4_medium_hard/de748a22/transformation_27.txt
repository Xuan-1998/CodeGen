===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem requires building up the solution from smaller subproblems to larger ones. Tabulation is more applicable.

State: For each query, consider a set of variables that represent the minimum number of elements to be removed from subarrays within the given range. Initialize a 2D array dp[n][q] where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of elements to be removed from the subarray [i, j].

Consider a prefix sum array and use it to keep track of the cumulative sum of the signs within each query's range. This allows you to determine whether the sign-variable sum is zero or not.

Memoization can be applied to solve this problem by defining a dictionary memo = {} and then using it to store previously computed values for subproblems. Then, before computing any subproblem, check if its result is already stored in memo and use that result instead of recomputing it.

Initialize the dp array with zeros, except for the base case where j equals 0. In this case, set dp[i][j] to be equal to the sum of the signs within the subarray [i, n-1].

For each query, iterate over all possible left boundaries (l) and right boundaries (r). For each pair (l, r), calculate the minimum number of elements to be removed by finding the minimum of dp[l-1][j] + sign_sum[r-l+1] and dp[i][j-1]. Add 1 to the minimum value if the sign-variable sum within the subarray [l, r] is not zero.

Finally, return the result for the query where j equals q-1.
