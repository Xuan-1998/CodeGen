===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem involves finding the minimal number of elements that can be removed from a given range of the array so that the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements is zero.

The state expression is dp[l][r] = minimum number of elements that can be removed from the subarray from index l to r.

dp[l][r] is the minimum number of elements that can be removed if and only if:
- The signs at indices l, l+1, ..., r are all positive or all negative (i.e., the sum of signs in this range is zero).
- For each i from l to r: 
  - If the sign at index i is positive, then we have two options: either remove this element and recursively solve for dp[i+1][r], or leave it and recursively solve for dp[l][i-1].
  - If the sign at index i is negative, then we also have two options: either remove this element and recursively solve for dp[i+1][r], or leave it and recursively solve for dp[l][i-1].

Tabulate solutions for subproblems by filling in a 2D array from bottom-up.
