===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

The state expression could be dp[i][j], representing the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the range [0, j] within the first i elements.
dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of elements that can be removed to make the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements zero, with transitions based on analyzing consecutive sign changes.

To improve the plan, consider the following:
- Initialize dp[0][j] as 0 for all j because there's no need to remove any elements initially.
- Define a function memoize that stores the results in a dictionary called memo. This will help avoid redundant computation and speed up the process.

For edge cases, consider handling the scenario where i or j is less than 1. In this case, return -1 (or any other value that indicates an invalid input).

Here's the updated version of the plan:
