===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem requires building up the solution from smaller subproblems to larger ones. Tabulation is more applicable.

State: Initialize dp array with size n+1 to store minimum removals for each prefix. For each query (l, r), find the minimum number of elements that can be removed within the given range [l,r] such that the sign sum is 0. The base case would be when l=0 or r=n-1.

Define a state as a tuple (start, end) representing the range [start, end]. Transition relationships would be built based on the idea of removing an element at position i in the array. This could involve updating dp[start+1:end] and adjusting the sign sum accordingly.

To apply tabulation, initialize an array dp where dp[i] represents the minimum number of elements that can be removed up to index i. Then:

    1. Initialize dp[0] = 0 as there are no removals needed for an empty range.
    2. For each query (l, r), find the minimum number of elements that can be removed within the given range [l,r]. This could involve calculating a prefix sum up to index l-1 and a suffix sum from index r+1 to n-1. Then, update dp[r] by adding the minimum of these two sums.

    3. For each i in range(l-1, r), update dp[i] by adding 1 if the sign at position i is different from the overall sign sum within the given range [l,r]. This would represent removing the element at position i.
    4. Return dp[r] as the minimum number of elements that can be removed.
