===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem involves finding the longest common prefix or suffix between two strings.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = 1 if the jth character in string i matches the jth character in another string, 0 if they don't match. However, this doesn't seem to directly apply to the given problem.

dp[i][j] should be redefined as follows: 
dp[i][j] is equal to the minimal number of elements that can be removed from the subarray [l..i] to make the sign-variable sum zero, considering only the signs of elements within this range.

Consider a bottom-up approach and initialize dp[i][0] to be 1 if the ith element is positive (1), or 0 if it's negative (-1). This is because we can always remove at least one element that has a different sign from the rest.

For the state transition, consider two cases: 

- If the current element has the same sign as the previous elements in the range [l..i], then dp[i][j] is equal to dp[i-1][j-1].
- If the current element has a different sign than the previous elements in the range [l..i], then dp[i][j] is equal to min(dp[i-1][j-1], 1) + 1. This is because we need to either remove one of the previous elements or this current element.

For query q, consider two cases:
- If r_q is less than i, then return dp[r_q][0].
- Otherwise, calculate dp[r_q][j] as mentioned above and return it.

This plan seems to be correct. It accounts for edge cases where the range [l..i] contains only one element or no elements.
