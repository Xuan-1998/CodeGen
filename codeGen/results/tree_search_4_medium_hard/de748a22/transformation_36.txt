===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem requires building up the solution from smaller subproblems to larger ones. Tabulation is more applicable.

The state can be represented as (left, right, sign_sum), where left and right are the indices of the leftmost and rightmost elements in the subarray, respectively, and sign_sum is the sum of signs in this subarray. The base case would be when the query range contains only one element.

State: (left, right, sign_sum), where left and right are the indices of the leftmost and rightmost elements in the subarray, respectively, and sign_sum is the sum of signs in this subarray.

To calculate the minimal number of elements to be removed, iterate over all elements in the query range. For each element, calculate the new sign sum after removing the element and check if it's zero or negative (to minimize the number of removals). If it's not zero, store the current minimum removal count in a memoization table.

The transition function would be: 
dp[left][right][sign_sum] = min(dp[left][i-1][sign_sum - signs[i]] + 1 for i from left to right)

Memoize the function that calculates the minimal number of elements to be removed based on the query range and sign sum state using a dictionary or cache.

The final answer would be dp[0][n-1][sign_sum], where n is the size of the array.
