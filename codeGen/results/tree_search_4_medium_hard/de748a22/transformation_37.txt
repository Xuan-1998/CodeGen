===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem requires building up the solution from smaller subproblems to larger ones. Tabulation is more applicable.

The state can be represented as (left, right, sign_sum), where left and right are the indices of the leftmost and rightmost elements in the subarray, respectively, and sign_sum is the sum of signs in this subarray.

Implement a binary search-based approach for memoization where the key is the sign sum and the value is the corresponding query range indices, reducing the time complexity.

For each query, use binary search to find the closest previous state that has the same sign sum. Calculate the number of elements that can be removed from this query range based on the difference between the current sign_sum and the sign_sum in the previously found state.

To improve the plan, consider using a more efficient data structure for memoization instead of binary search.
