===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem involves finding the minimal number of elements that can be removed from a given range of the array so that the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements is zero.

Define the state expression as dp[l][r] = the minimal number of elements that can be removed from the range [l, r] to make the sign-variable sum zero.

dp[l][r] = min(dp[l+1][i-1] + count[sign], i-l) for all i in [l, r] such that sign is the same as the sign at position i.

Design a memoized bottom-up approach where the state is updated incrementally as the function iterates through the problem instance, with memoization used to avoid redundant computation.

For each query, iterate over the range and calculate dp[l][r] using the above recursive formula. The final answer will be the minimal number of elements that can be removed from the entire array.
