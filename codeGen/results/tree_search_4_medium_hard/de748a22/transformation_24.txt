===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

The base case could be when i = 0 or j = 0, in which case there are no more elements to consider and thus no elements need to be removed.
Consider using a DP table where the state is (i, sum) representing the number of elements that need to be removed from the range [l, r] given the sum of all numbers in the range, and the transition relationships could be defined as: dp[i][sum] = min(dp[i-1][sum + s[i]] if l <= i and i <= r, 0)

To solve this problem using top-down dynamic programming with memoization:

- Start by initializing a 2D DP table of size (n+1) x (k+1), where n is the number of elements in the array and k is the maximum possible sum.

- Iterate over all possible ranges [l, r] for each query. For each range, iterate from i = l to i = r.
- At each step, calculate the new sum by adding or subtracting s[i] depending on its sign.
- If this new sum has been encountered before, return the stored result. Otherwise, update the DP table and recursively call dp(i - 1, sum + s[i]) if l <= i and i <= r.
