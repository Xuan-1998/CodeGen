===BEGIN PLAN===
State: For each query, consider a set of variables that represent the minimum number of elements to be removed from subarrays within the given range.

Formulate state as follows:
	- Initialize dp[i][0] and dp[i][1] for 0 <= i <= n with values based on sign array.
	- Iterate over all queries, updating dp[i][j] (where j = 0 or 1) based on whether signs within the current window sum to zero or not.

Transition relationship:
    - If signs in the current window sum to zero, then we don't need to remove any elements from the previous window.
    - If signs in the current window don't sum to zero, then we need to remove some elements from the previous window. The minimum number of elements needed is the minimum of removing all positive numbers or all negative numbers.

Maintain a running count of positive and negative numbers in the current window:
    - Initialize counts of positive and negative numbers for each subproblem.
    - Update these counts based on sign array and whether signs sum to zero or not.

===END PLAN===
