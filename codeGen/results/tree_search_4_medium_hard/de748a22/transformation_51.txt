===BEGIN PLAN===
State: Initialize dp array with size n+1 to store minimum removals for each prefix. The state would be (start, end) representing the range [start, end]. The base case would be when l=0 or r=n-1.

dp[0][i] = sum of signs from 0 to i
dp[i][n-1] = sum of signs from i to n-1

Transition relationships:
- dp[l][r] = min(dp[i][l-1] + number of removals from l to r) for all i in [l, r]
- dp[0][i] = 0
- dp[i][n-1] = sum of signs from 0 to n-1

Memoization:
- Store intermediate results in a dictionary or hashmap to avoid redundant computations.
- For each query (l, r), calculate the minimum number of removals for the given range [l, r].

Query processing:
- Process queries one by one.
- For each query (l, r), find the minimum number of elements that can be removed within the given range [l, r] such that the sign sum is 0.
- Use memoization to store intermediate results.

Time complexity: O(n * q)
Space complexity: O(n)

Note:
- The base case dp[0][i] = 0 and dp[i][n-1] = sum of signs from 0 to n-1 can be optimized by using a single loop instead of two loops.
- The transition relationship dp[l][r] = min(dp[i][l-1] + number of removals from l to r) for all i in [l, r] can be optimized by using a sliding window approach.
