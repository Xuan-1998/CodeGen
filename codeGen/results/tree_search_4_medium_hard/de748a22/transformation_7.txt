===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the first i elements to make the sign-variable sum zero.

Formulate state and transition relationships based on whether the last element is positive or negative:
  - If the last element is positive, we have two choices: either remove it (dp[i-1]) or keep it and recursively consider removing elements up to the second-to-last element (dp[i-2] + 1).
  - If the last element is negative, we also have two choices: either remove it (dp[i-1]) or keep it and recursively consider removing elements up to the second-to-last element (dp[i-2] + 1).

Optimal substructure:
  - Removing an element that has opposite sign to the majority sign variable can lead to a smaller removal count, as this would reduce the absolute sum of signs.
Dynamically construct a recursive function that calculates the optimal removal count by pruning unnecessary branches based on memoization:
  - For positive last element: dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + 1)
  - For negative last element: dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + 1)
