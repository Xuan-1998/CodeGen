===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

Let dp[i][j] represent the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the range [l, r] to make the sign-variable sum zero.
Create a dictionary to store memoized values, where keys are tuples (i, j) and values are minimum removal counts.

For each query, iterate over all possible partitions of the elements into positive and negative groups. For each partition, calculate dp[i][j] by considering all possible removals of elements from the range [l, r].

To improve performance, consider using a prefix sum array to efficiently compute the sign-variable sum for each subarray.

Edge cases:
- Handle queries where l = 1 or r = n
- Handle queries where l > r
