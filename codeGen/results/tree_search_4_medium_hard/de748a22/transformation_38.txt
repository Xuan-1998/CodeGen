===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem requires building up the solution from smaller subproblems to larger ones. Tabulation is more applicable.

The state can be represented as (left, right, sign_sum), where left and right are the indices of the leftmost and rightmost elements in the subarray, respectively, and sign_sum is the sum of signs in this subarray. The base case would be when the query range contains only one element.

Transition relationship: For a given state, we can transition to two new states by either removing the leftmost or the rightmost element from the current subarray. When removing an element with sign x, the sign_sum decreases by x. We need to consider all possible transitions and find the minimum number of elements that needs to be removed.

We can implement tabulation using a 3D array dp[left][right][sign_sum] where dp[left][right][sign_sum] represents the minimum number of elements to remove such that the sign sum of remaining elements is zero and left, right are within the query range. The base case would be when the query range contains only one element.

To optimize the transition relationship, we can precompute the prefix sums of signs for all elements in O(n) time complexity and store it in an array. Then, for each state (left, right, sign_sum), we can calculate the sign sum of the subarray in O(1) time complexity using the prefix sums.

The plan is correct but needs some adjustments to handle edge cases. We should also consider the query range as well. The plan does not include any edge cases.
