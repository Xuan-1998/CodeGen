This plan seems correct and should work for solving the problem. It takes into account the overlapping subproblems by using memoization to store previously computed values.

The edge cases are handled as follows:
- When there is only one element in the range, we simply consider its sign.
- When the range contains multiple elements, we calculate the sum of signs and add it to the minimum of the sums of the left and right halves. This ensures that we remove the minimal number of elements.

This plan does not include any edge cases specifically, but it handles them implicitly by considering all possible subproblems and their combinations.
