===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

The state expression could be dp[i][j], representing the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the range [0, j] within the first i elements.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of elements that can be removed to make the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements zero. To calculate this, analyze consecutive sign changes within the range [0, j] and determine how many elements need to be removed to balance the sign-variable sum.

The problem can be solved using a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from range [0, j] within the first i elements. Initialize the base cases by setting dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since no elements need to be removed when considering only the first element.

When calculating dp[i][j], consider two possibilities: removing an even number of elements from the range [i-1, j-1] or removing an odd number of elements. For each possibility, calculate the new sign-variable sum and update dp[i][j] accordingly.

Edge cases to consider include j = 0 (when considering only the first element) and i = n (when considering all elements). In these cases, adjust the transitions accordingly.
