State: dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of elements to be removed from subarray [i..j] considering all previously seen positive integers as well as those within [i..j].
Create table dp[0...n-1][0...n-1], where dp[i][j] = min(0 <= k <= j) { dp[k-1][i-1] + (signs[k-1] == 1 ? 1 : -1) }
where signs is the input array of signs.
Initialize dp[0][0] to 0
For each query (l, r), calculate min(dp[l-1][r-1]) as the answer for this query.
