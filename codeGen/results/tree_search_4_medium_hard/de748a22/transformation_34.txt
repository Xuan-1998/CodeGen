===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem requires building up the solution from smaller subproblems to larger ones. Tabulation is more applicable.

State: For each query, consider a set of variables that represent the minimum number of elements to be removed from subarrays within the given range. Represent the state by the maximum number of positive integers seen so far in the given range.

Transition relationships can be established using dynamic programming, considering the previous maximum and the new elements that have been added or removed.

Use two pointers, start and end, to traverse the input array and update the dynamic programming table based on the sign of each integer. If the current element is positive, increment pos_count[end], where end is the current index. Then, if start > 0, decrement pos_count[start]. Finally, increment or decrement dp[start][end] depending on the cumulative sum.

For each query, find the minimal number of elements that can be removed from the given range so that the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements is zero. This involves calculating the maximum number of positive integers seen in the given range and then removing all but one of them to balance the sign-variable sum.
