===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

Let's consider a state dp[i][j], representing the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the range [0, j] within the first i elements.
dp[i][j] represents the maximum sign-variable sum achievable by selecting a subset of elements from [0, j], with transitions based on comparing signs between adjacent pairs of elements.

Create a bottom-up dynamic programming solution where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the range [0, j] within the first i elements. This can be calculated by considering two cases:
- If the sign of the current element is the same as the sign of the previous element, then we can remove all elements with the same sign until a different sign is encountered.
- If the sign of the current element is different from the sign of the previous element, then we need to consider both possibilities and take the minimum.
