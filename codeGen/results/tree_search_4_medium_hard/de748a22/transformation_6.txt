===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the first i elements to make the sign-variable sum zero.

Formulate state and transition relationships based on whether the last element is positive or negative. 

State: 
- If the last element is positive, then we consider two options:
  - Remove this positive element
  - Do not remove it
- If the last element is negative, then we also consider two options:
  - Remove this negative element
  - Do not remove it

Transition relationships:
- If the last element is positive, then the optimal substructure would be removing elements with opposite signs to the majority sign variable.
  dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[j]) + (signs[i] == signs[j] ? 0 : 1)
  where j is such that the sum of signs from i to j is zero.

- If the last element is negative, then the optimal substructure would be removing elements with same signs to the majority sign variable.
  dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[j]) + (signs[i] == signs[j] ? 0 : -1)
  where j is such that the sum of signs from i to j is zero.

Maintain an array dp of size n+1, filling it in a bottom-up manner by considering the minimum removal count for each subarray and the last element's sign.
