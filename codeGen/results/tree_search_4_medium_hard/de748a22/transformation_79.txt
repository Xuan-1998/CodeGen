===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem involves finding the minimal number of elements that can be removed from a given range of the array so that the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements is zero.

Define the state expression as dp[l][r] = minimal number of elements that can be removed from the range [l, r] to satisfy the condition.

dp[l][r] = min(dp[i][r]) for l <= i <= r

Apply the bottom-up approach by iterating over the array from left to right, maintaining a running sum of signs and updating the dp table accordingly.

For each query, calculate the minimal number of elements that can be removed from the given range [l, r] to satisfy the condition using the dynamic programming table dp[l][r].
