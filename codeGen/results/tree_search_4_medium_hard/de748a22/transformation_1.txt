===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the first i elements to make the sign-variable sum zero.

Consider dp[i] as the minimal number of elements that can be removed from the first i elements to make the sign-variable sum zero, where the last element is either included or not.

To implement memoization by modifying the recursive function to store and reuse intermediate results in a dictionary. 

For each query (l, r), calculate dp[r] - dp[l-1] if l > 0, which represents the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the range [l, r].

Initialize an array prefix_sum with the same size as the given array, where prefix_sum[i] is the sum of signs from index 0 to i.

Use a dictionary to store intermediate results for memoization. Initialize dp[0] = 0 and prefix_sum[0] = 1 or -1 (the sign of the first element).

Then, iterate through the array and update the dictionary and the prefix_sum array in O(n) time complexity.

For each query, find the sum of signs from index l-1 to r using prefix_sum array. If the sum is zero, return 0; otherwise, calculate dp[r] - dp[l-1] and add it to the answer.

Finally, return the answer as the minimal number of elements that can be removed from the given range of the array to satisfy the condition.
