===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem requires building up the solution from smaller subproblems to larger ones. Tabulation is more applicable.

State: Initialize dp array with size n+1 to store minimum removals for each prefix. For each query (l, r), find the minimum number of elements that can be removed within the given range [l,r] such that the sign sum is 0.

The state could be defined as a tuple (start, end) representing the range [start, end], and transition relationships would be built based on the idea of removing an element at position i in the array. 

To implement dynamic programming using a bottom-up approach with tabulation, consider initializing a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the subarray [i, j]. 

Update the state as follows:
- Initialize dp[0][j] for all j (0 <= j < n) to 0. This represents the base case when the query range starts from the beginning.
- Initialize dp[i][n-1] for all i (0 <= i < n) to 0. This represents the base case when the query range ends at the end.

Transition relationships:
- For each pair of elements at positions i and j, where i < j, update dp[i][j] as follows: 
    + If the signs of these two elements are the same (both positive or both negative), increment dp[i][j] by 1. This represents removing one element to balance the sign sum.
    + If the signs of these two elements are different (one positive and one negative), update dp[i][j] as follows: 
        - If j-i+1 is even, set dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1] + 1) to account for removing an element at position i or j.
        - If j-i+1 is odd, set dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j-1], dp[i][j-1] + 1) to account for removing an element at position i or j.

Finally, iterate through the queries and update the minimum number of elements that can be removed within each query range by looking up the values in the dp array.
