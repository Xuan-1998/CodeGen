State:
    Initialize dp array with size n+1 to store minimum removals for each prefix.

State Transition Function:
    Let's define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the subarray A[i..j] to make the sign sum zero, considering all possible removals.
    We can calculate dp[i][j] by iterating over each element in the subarray A[i..j] and deciding whether to remove it or not.
    For a given element at index k within the range [i,j], if its sign is equal to the total sign of elements from i to j, then we don't need to remove this element.
    If the sign is opposite, then we can either keep the current sign and move on to the next element or remove this element.

Base Case:
    dp[0][j] = 0 for all j because there are no elements to remove at the beginning of the array.
    dp[i][n-1] = 0 for all i because there are no elements to remove at the end of the array.

Query Answering:
    For a query (l,r), we can find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed within the given range [l,r] by using the previously computed dp values.
    We can calculate this value as follows: 
        If l = 0, then the answer is dp[0][r].
        If r = n-1, then the answer is dp[l][n-1].
        For any other query (l,r), we need to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from A[l..m] where m is the smallest index such that dp[l][m-1] + 1 = dp[m][r].

Overall Plan:
    Initialize a 2D array dp with size n+1 and fill it up in a bottom-up manner.
    For each query (l,r), find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed within the given range [l,r] by using the previously computed dp values.

Potential Issues with the Plan:
    The plan assumes that there are no duplicate sign variables, if there can be duplicates then we might not get the correct answer.
