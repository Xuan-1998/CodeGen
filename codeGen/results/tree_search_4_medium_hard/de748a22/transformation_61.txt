===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach and tabulation.

State expression: dp[i][j] = The minimum number of elements that can be removed from the first i elements to make the sign-variable sum zero, considering only elements up to index j.
Base case:
  - Initialize dp[0][j] for all j. This is because there are no elements to remove when i = 0.

Transition equation: 
  - For i > 0 and 1 <= j <= n:
    - If the sign of the current element (i.e., arr[i-1]) is the same as the majority sign in the range [0, j], then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j].
    - Otherwise, dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1, dp[i-1][j] + 1).
  
For each query (l, r), the answer is dp[r][r] - dp[l-1][r].

This plan includes edge cases. For example, when i = 0 or j = 0, there are no elements to remove.
