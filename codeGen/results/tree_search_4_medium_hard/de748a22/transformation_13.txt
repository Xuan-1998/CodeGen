===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

The state expression could be dp[i][j], representing the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the range [0, j] within the first i elements.

dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of elements that can be removed to make the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements zero. To calculate this value, we need to analyze consecutive sign changes and update the dp table accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Initialize the dp table with dimensions (n+1) x (r+1), where n is the number of elements and r is the maximum right index in any query. Fill it with infinity values initially, except for dp[0][0] which should be 0.

2. Iterate over each query, and for each query update the dp table as follows:
   - Calculate the sign-variable sum of the elements from l to r.
   - If the sum is zero, return the minimum number of elements that can be removed, which is the number of negative signs minus the number of positive signs.
   - Else, calculate the minimum number of elements that can be removed by subtracting 1 from the current value of dp[i][j] and recursively calling the function for the remaining range.

3. The final answer would be the value stored in dp[n][r].

This plan should work correctly if implemented properly. However, it might be optimized further by using a more efficient way to update the dp table.
