===BEGIN PLAN===
State: Initialize dp array with size n+1 and memo dictionary to store minimum removals for each prefix and query.
For each query (l, r), find the minimum number of elements that can be removed within the given range [l,r] such that the sign sum is 0.

Define dp[i][j] as the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the subarray A[i..j] to make the sign sum zero.
Base case: If l=0 or r=n-1, return 0 since there's no need to remove any element.
Memoization using dictionary: Create a memo where memo[(i, j)] returns the minimum number of elements that can be removed from A[i..j] to make the sign sum zero.

For each query (l, r), do the following:

1. Calculate sign_sum = sum(sign(A[k]) for k in range(l,r+1))
2. If sign_sum == 0, return dp[l][r]
3. Initialize min_removed = float('inf')
4. For each k in range(l, r+1):
    a. Update min_removed = min(min_removed, dp[l][k-1] + (sign(A[k]) * 2 - sum(sign(A[i]) for i in range(k,r+1))) % 2)
5. Return min_removed
