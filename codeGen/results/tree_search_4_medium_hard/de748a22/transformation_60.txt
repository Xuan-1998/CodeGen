===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization.

Let dp[i][j] = minimal number of elements that can be removed from the first i elements to make the sign-variable sum zero, considering only elements up to index j.

We need to preprocess the array to know the cumulative sign sum for each prefix. Let's call this array cum_sum. Then, for each query [l, r], we find dp[r][r] - dp[l-1][l-1]. This is because if we remove x elements from the range [l, r] to make the sign-variable sum zero, that means we also need to add x elements from the left part of the array to get a total sum of zero. The dp values for the left part are already calculated.

Here's the updated plan:
