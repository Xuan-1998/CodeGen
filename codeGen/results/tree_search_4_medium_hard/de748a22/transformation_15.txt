===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

The state expression could be dp[i][j], representing the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the range [0, j] within the first i elements.
dp[i][j] represents the maximum sign-variable sum achievable by selecting a subset of elements from [0, j], with transitions based on comparing signs between adjacent pairs of elements.

The base case would be when j = 0, in which case dp[i][j] is always 0, as we can't remove any elements from an empty range.
For the recursive case, consider the maximum sign-variable sum achievable by either including or excluding the i-th element. If the sign of the i-th element is the same as that of the (i-1)-th element, then we can include the i-th element and get a higher sign-variable sum. Otherwise, we can exclude the i-th element to maintain the maximum sign-variable sum.

Memoize the recursive function to avoid redundant calculations and store the results in a 2D array.
The time complexity would be O(n * q), where n is the number of elements in the array and q is the number of queries. The space complexity would be O(n * q) as well, for storing the dynamic programming table.
