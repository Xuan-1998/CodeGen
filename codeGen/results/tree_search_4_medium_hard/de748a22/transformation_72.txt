===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves finding the minimum number of elements that can be removed from a given range to make the sign-variable sum zero.

Define the state expression as dp[l][r] = the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the range [l, r] such that the sign-variable sum is zero. 

Base case: When l = r, there are no more elements to remove, so dp[l][r] = 0.

Recursive relation: If all elements in the range [l, r] have the same sign (either all positive or all negative), then we can remove all of them and get a sum that is zero. In this case, dp[l][r] = n - (r - l + 1).

If the elements do not all have the same sign, then we consider two cases: removing the first element with a different sign, or leaving it as is. If we remove it, then we recursively call dp[l + 1][r] and add one to the result. If we leave it as is, then we recursively call dp[l][r - 1].

Memoize the recursive function calls to avoid redundant computation.
