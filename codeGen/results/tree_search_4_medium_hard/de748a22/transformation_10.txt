===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

The state expression could be dp[i][j], representing the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the range [0, j] within the first i elements.

dp[i][j] represents the sign-variable sum of elements in the range [i-j+1, i-1], with transitions based on comparing signs within consecutive elements.

Use a single dictionary to store and look up intermediate results.

To optimize the transition function, consider using a sliding window approach to calculate the sign-variable sum for each subproblem. This would reduce the time complexity of the transition function.

For edge cases, ensure that the initial values of dp[i][j] are correctly handled (e.g., when i = 0 or j = 0).

Update the plan to handle queries efficiently by precalculating and storing all possible prefix sums within each query range. This would allow for a single look-up operation in O(1) time.
