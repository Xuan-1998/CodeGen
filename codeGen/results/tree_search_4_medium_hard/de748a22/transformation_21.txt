===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems and an optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

The base case could be when i = 0 or j = 0, in which case there are no more elements to consider and thus no elements need to be removed.
dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 0

The transition relationships could be defined as:
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 if s[i] != s[j], dp[i-1][j] if l <= i and i <= r, dp[i][j-1] if l <= j and j <= r)

Memoize the dp array by defining a helper function with default argument values.
dp = [[[] for _ in range(r + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]

The dynamic programming state would be dp[i][j], representing the minimum number of elements to remove from [l, i] and [j, r] such that the sign-variable sum is zero.

To improve the plan:
- The base case could be refined to handle cases where l or r is outside the valid range.
- A boundary check should be added in the transition relationships to ensure that i and j are within the valid range.
- The dp array initialization can be optimized by reusing previous results.

The plan seems to include edge cases, such as when l or r is 0. However, further testing would be necessary to confirm this.
