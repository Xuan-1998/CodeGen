===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

Let dp[i] represent the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the first i elements to make the sign-variable sum zero.

Consider dp[i] as the minimal number of elements that can be removed from the first i elements to make the sign-variable sum zero, where the last element is either included or not. 

To implement memoization using a dictionary, initialize it with default values (e.g., 0) and use a function to compute each dp[i] value based on previously computed dp[j] values.

Let's define two functions: one to update the sign-variable sum when including the last element, and another to update the sign-variable sum when excluding the last element. These functions will help in calculating the minimum number of elements that can be removed.

The function updating the sign-variable sum when including the last element could be dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (signs[i] == '+' ? 1 : -1) if signs[i] is equal to '+' or '-' respectively. The function updating the sign-variable sum when excluding the last element could be dp[i-1].

To find the minimum number of elements that can be removed for each query, iterate through all queries and calculate the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the given range using a similar approach.

The final result would be the minimum number of elements that can be removed for each query.
