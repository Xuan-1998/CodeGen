State: For each query, consider a set of variables that represent the minimum number of elements to be removed from subarrays within the given range. Initialize an array dp[i] where i is the maximum number of positive integers seen so far in the given range.

Transition relationships can be established using dynamic programming:

dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + (pos_count[r] - pos_count[l-1]), i) 

where l and r are the query's left and right boundaries, and pos_count is an array that keeps track of the cumulative count of positive integers up to index i.

Maintain a separate array pos_count[i] that keeps track of the cumulative count of positive integers up to index i. This can help in determining the state transition.

For each query:

1. Calculate pos_count[r] - pos_count[l-1] which represents the number of new positive integers seen in this range.
2. For each possible subarray within the given range, calculate dp[j-1] + (pos_count[r] - pos_count[l-1]) where j is the maximum number of positive integers seen so far in this subarray.
3. Return min(dp[j-1] + (pos_count[r] - pos_count[l-1])) as the minimum number of elements that can be removed.
