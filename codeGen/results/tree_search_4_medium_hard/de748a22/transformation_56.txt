===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves calculating the minimal number of elements that can be removed from a given range of the array so that the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements is zero.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = True if the prefix/suffix of length j in string i is a common prefix/suffix, False otherwise. This approach does not seem to apply correctly as it's based on finding the longest common prefix or suffix between two strings, which isn't relevant here.

A correct plan would be:

The dynamic programming problem involves calculating the minimal number of elements that can be removed from each range in order to get a sign-variable sum of zero.

Let dp[i][j] denote the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from array indices [0, i] so that the sum of signs becomes zero. The state expression is:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + 1 | k varies over all possible positions where sign changes) if sign at index j is different than the previous one
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] otherwise

Memoize a recursive function to prune branches that don't lead to a solution.

The base case would be when i < l or i >= r, in which case return 0.

The final answer for query (l, r) is dp[r-1][r-1].
