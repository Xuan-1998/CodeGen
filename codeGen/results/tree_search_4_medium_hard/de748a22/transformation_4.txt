===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

Let dp[i][j] represent the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the range [i, j] to make the sign-variable sum zero. This is because we need to consider all possible partitions of the elements into positive and negative groups within this range.

Use a dictionary dp to store memoized values, where keys are ranges (i, j) and values are minimum removal counts for those ranges. Initialize dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since removing no elements from an empty range results in zero sign-variable sum.

For each query [l, r], consider the following:

* Calculate the sign-variable sum of the elements within this range.
* If the sum is already zero, return 0, as no elements need to be removed.
* Otherwise, find the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the range [i, j] such that the remaining elements' sign-variable sum is zero. This can be done by iterating over all possible partitions of the elements into positive and negative groups within this range.
