===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

The state expression could be dp[i][j], representing the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the range [0, j] within the first i elements.
dp[i][j] represents the maximum sign-variable sum achievable by selecting a subset of elements from [0, j], with transitions based on comparing signs between adjacent pairs of elements.

The base case could be dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there are no elements to remove when i is 0.
For the transition function:
- If the sign-variable sum up to the current element (i.e., sum(dp[i-1][k] + arr[k]) from k=0 to j) is zero, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j], since there's no need to remove any elements.
- Otherwise, dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]), as we can either include the current element or exclude it.

Dynamically update a 2D array dp with dimensions (n+1) x q, where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of elements that can be removed from range [0, j] within the first i elements.
The final answer for query l and r would be dp[n][r]-dp[n][l-1].
This plan seems correct; however, it's crucial to handle edge cases such as l being 0 or r being n.
