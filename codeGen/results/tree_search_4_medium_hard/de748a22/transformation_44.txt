===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem requires building up the solution from smaller subproblems to larger ones. Tabulation is more applicable.

State: Initialize dp array with size n+1 to store minimum removals for each prefix, and another array sign to store the sum of signs in the range [i,j]. For each query (l,r), find the minimum number of elements that can be removed within the given range [l,r] such that the sign sum is 0. The base case would be when l=0 or r=n-1.

Consider a state where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of elements that can be removed within the range [i,j] such that the sign sum is 0.
Create a 2D DP array and iterate over the entire range, considering for each element in the range whether removing it would change the sign sum. If yes, then consider including it in the optimal solution.

If l=0 or r=n-1, base case dp[l][r] = count of elements with negative signs within the range [l,r].
Else, transition state dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + |sign[i,j]| where sign[i,j] is the sum of signs in the range [i,j].

The final answer would be dp[0][n-1].
