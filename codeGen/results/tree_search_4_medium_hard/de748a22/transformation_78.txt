===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem involves finding the minimum number of elements that can be removed from a given range of the array so that the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements is zero.

Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = True if the minimal number of elements to remove for the subarray from i to j can be achieved by removing at most k elements, and False otherwise.

dp[i][j] = (sign_sum[j] == 0) or (min(k+1, sum(sign[k:])) <= min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])), where sign_sum[j] represents the sum of signs from i to j, and k is the index from i to j.

Use memoization by storing previously computed sign sums in a dictionary called memo.

For each query, calculate the minimal number of elements that can be removed for the subarray from l_i to r_i using the dp[i][j] expression.
