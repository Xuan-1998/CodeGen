===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure, making memoization suitable.

The base case could be when i = 0 or j = 0, in which case there are no more elements to consider and thus no elements need to be removed.

Dynamic programming can be used by defining a DP array where the state is (i, j) representing the number of elements that need to be removed from the range [l, r] to get a sum of zero. 

Use memoization by defining a dictionary dp[(i, j)] and store the results in it as you iterate through the input array.

For each query (l, r), calculate the prefix sum up to l-1 and suffix sum starting from r+1. This can be done using a single pass through the array.

For the range [l, r], subtract the prefix sum from the total sum of the array and then add the suffix sum. If this is zero, no elements need to be removed; otherwise, use dynamic programming to find the minimal number of elements that need to be removed.

This approach ensures that all overlapping subproblems are solved only once, making it efficient.
