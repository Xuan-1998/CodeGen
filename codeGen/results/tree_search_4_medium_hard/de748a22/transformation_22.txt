===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

The base case could be when i = 0 or j = 0, in which case there are no more elements to consider and thus no elements need to be removed.
The transition relationships could be defined as: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 if s[i] != s[j], dp[i-1][j] if l <= i and i <= r, dp[i][j-1] if l <= j and j <= r)

Use a 2D list comprehension to initialize the dp array with all values as infinity (or some large number), then update dp[0][0] = 0.

For each query (l, r):
    Update the dp array for this range.
    Find the minimum removals in this range by taking the minimum of the top-right, top, and left cells that fall within the range.

Store intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.
Use a variable to keep track of the minimum removals across all queries.
