===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem is actually about finding the minimal number of elements that can be removed from a given range of the array so that the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements is zero.

The dynamic programming approach involves calculating the sum of signs for all possible subarrays and then iterating through the query ranges to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the sum zero.

State expression: dp[i][j] = sum of signs in subarray [i, j]

dp[i][j] represents whether the sum of signs in the subarray from index i to j is zero. If it's not zero, then we need to remove elements to make it zero. The state transition function would be:

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + (signs[i-1] - signs[j])

Where signs[k] represents the sign of the k-th element in the array.

The base case for this problem would be when i or j is equal to 0, then we can just return a value that indicates no elements need to be removed because the sum is already zero.

Then you can iterate through the query ranges and calculate the minimum number of elements that need to be removed by iterating from left to right and keeping track of the cumulative sum of signs. Whenever you see a sign change, that means you need to remove one more element.

This plan should work for the given constraints but it might not be efficient because it requires O(n * q) space complexity and O(n + q) time complexity. You can improve this by using a running total or cumulative sum of signs instead of storing all the sums in dp array, which would reduce the space complexity to O(q).

Also, you should handle edge cases where n or q is zero.
