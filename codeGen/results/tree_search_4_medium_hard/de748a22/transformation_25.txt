===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

The base case could be when i = 0 or j = 0, in which case there are no more elements to consider and thus no elements need to be removed.
Consider using a DP table where the state is (i, sum) representing the number of elements that need to be removed from the range [l, r] given the sum of all numbers in the range, and the transition relationships could be defined as: 
dp[i][sum] = min(dp[i-1][sum + s[i]] if l <= i and i <= r, 0)

Design a memoized function that uses a dictionary to store the results of subproblems for efficient retrieval. 

For each query, iterate over all elements in the range [l, r], calculating the sum of the signs and updating dp accordingly. 
When querying the DP table, check if the current sum is already stored; if so, return the stored value. 
If not, calculate the new sum by adding the sign of the current element, and recursively query the DP table for this new sum. 

Return the result of the base case.
