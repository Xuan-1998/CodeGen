===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem is actually about finding the minimal number of elements that can be removed from a given range of the array so that the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements is zero.

dp[i][j] = True if there are at least j+1 ones in the first i strings, and False otherwise. Initialize dp as a 2D array of size (n+1) x (m+1), where n is the number of queries, m is the maximum range of the query.

The state transition function is:

dp[i][j] = True if there are at least j+1 ones in the first i strings and dp[i-1][k] is True for k <= j.
False otherwise.

Top-down approach with memoization can be applied. Initialize dp as a 2D array of size (n+1) x (m+1).

The base case is dp[0][j] = False for all j.

The state transition function can be implemented recursively or iteratively, whichever suits the problem better.

The final answer for each query is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the given range so that the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements is zero.
