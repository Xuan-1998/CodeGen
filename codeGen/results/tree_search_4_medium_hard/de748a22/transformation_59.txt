===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem involves finding the minimal number of elements that can be removed from a given range of the array so that the sign-variable sum of the remaining elements is zero.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = The minimum number of elements that can be removed from the first i elements to make the sign-variable sum zero, considering only elements up to index j.
dp[i][j] = 0 if there are no more elements in the current range, and the sign-variable sum is already zero. If not, it's the minimum number of elements that can be removed plus one.

Use a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the first i elements to make the sign-variable sum zero, considering only elements up to index j.
dp[0][j] = 0 for all j because there are no more elements in the current range.

For each query, calculate the minimal number of elements that can be removed by iterating over the array and keeping track of the sign-variable sum. The answer is the minimum number of elements that can be removed to make the sign-variable sum zero.
