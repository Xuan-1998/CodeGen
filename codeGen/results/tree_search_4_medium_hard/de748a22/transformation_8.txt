===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

The state expression could be dp[i][j], representing the minimum number of elements that can be removed from the range [0, j] within the first i elements.
dp[i][j] represents the sign-variable sum of elements in the range [i-j+1, i-1], with transitions based on comparing signs within consecutive elements.

Let's analyze the plan step by step:

1. Initialize a 2D DP array dp[n+q][n+q], where n is the number of elements and q is the number of queries.
dp[i][j] will store the minimum number of removals for the range [0, j] within the first i elements.

2. Create a function update_dp(i, j) that updates dp[i][j] based on the sign-variable sum of elements in the range [i-j+1, i-1].
   - If the sign-variable sum is non-zero, then at least one element must be removed to make it zero.
   - Check if the sign-variable sum changes sign within consecutive elements. If it does, remove one element from that pair.

3. Initialize dp[0][j] = j for all 0 <= j < n+q, since all elements in a range [0, j] can be removed to make the sign-variable sum zero.

4. Iterate through the array and update dp[i][j] using the function update_dp(i, j) for all i > 0 and 0 <= j < n+q.

5. For each query, calculate the minimum number of removals by taking the minimum value from dp[r_i-1][l_i-1], where l_i and r_i are the range boundaries in the query.
