===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem requires building up the solution from smaller subproblems to larger ones. Tabulation is more applicable.

State: For each query, consider a set of variables that represent the minimum number of elements to be removed from subarrays within the given range.

Consider a prefix sum array and use it to keep track of the cumulative sum of the signs within each query's range. This allows you to determine whether the sign-variable sum is zero or not.

Dynamic programming can be implemented by creating a table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the subarray from index i to j.

To improve this plan, we can iterate through each query and for each query, iterate through all possible subarrays within the given range. Initialize dp[0][j] as 0 and dp[i][0] as 0 because there is no element to remove initially. Then update dp[i][j] based on whether the sign-variable sum of the current subarray is zero or not.
