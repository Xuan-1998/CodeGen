===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem has overlapping subproblems, but not a clear optimal substructure. Memoization would be suitable.

Let's define dp[i][j] as the minimal number of elements that need to be removed from the range [l, r] to get a sign-variable sum of zero. The base case could be when i = 0 or j = 0, in which case there are no more elements to consider and thus no elements need to be removed.

To fill the dp array, we iterate over all pairs (i, j) such that 1 <= i <= n and 1 <= j <= n. For each pair, calculate the sign-variable sum of the range [l, r] by iterating over all elements in the range and adding their signs to a variable. If this sum is zero, update dp[i][j] with the minimal number of elements that need to be removed from this range.

Finally, for each query, find the minimal number of elements that can be removed from the given range [l, r] by looking up the value in the dp array and returning it as the answer.
