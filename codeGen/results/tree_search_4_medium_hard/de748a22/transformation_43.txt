===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem requires building up the solution from smaller subproblems to larger ones. Tabulation is more applicable.

The state can be represented as (left, right, sign_sum), where left and right are the indices of the leftmost and rightmost elements in the subarray, respectively, and sign_sum is the sum of signs in this subarray. The base case would be when the query range contains only one element.
Construct a binary indexed tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree to efficiently update the sign sum as we traverse the array.

To further improve the plan:
- For each query, first calculate the cumulative sum of signs from left to right and from right to left. Then, calculate the sign sum for the given range. This can be done using prefix sums.
- To minimize the number of operations in the dynamic programming process, it is recommended to sort the array based on its elements before processing queries.

This plan seems correct and covers the essential aspects. It includes edge cases by considering queries with single-element ranges. The plan also handles updating the sign sum efficiently using a BIT or Fenwick Tree.
