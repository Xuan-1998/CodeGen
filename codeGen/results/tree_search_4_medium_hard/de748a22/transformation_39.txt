===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem requires building up the solution from smaller subproblems to larger ones. Tabulation is more applicable.

The state can be represented as (left, right, sign_sum), where left and right are the indices of the leftmost and rightmost elements in the subarray, respectively, and sign_sum is the sum of signs in this subarray. The base case would be when the query range contains only one element.

Transition relationship: For a given state, we can transition to two new states by either removing the leftmost or the rightmost element from the current subarray.

To improve the plan:

*   Instead of storing all possible states and their corresponding minimum number of elements to remove, we can use a priority queue to store only the states with non-zero sign sum. This will reduce the space complexity.
*   When transitioning to new states, we should update the sign_sum accordingly.
*   The transition relationship should also consider the case when both leftmost and rightmost elements have the same sign.

Additional considerations:

*   For edge cases where the query range contains all elements in the array, we need to handle this separately. In this case, the minimum number of elements to remove is 0 if the sign sum is zero; otherwise, it's equal to the absolute value of the sign sum.
