===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to maximize the grade, consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with memoization. We can define a state as the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a given decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.

The base case is dp[0] = 1, since there's no time spent initially.
Iterate from i = 1 to n:
    For each rounding choice (round up or down) for the ith digit, calculate the new grade and update dp[i] accordingly. For example, if the ith digit is 4 or greater, we can round up to get 5, while if it's less than 4 but greater than or equal to 2, we can round down to get 0.

Memoize the function by storing the results of subproblems in a list and accessing them as needed. Return dp[n] as the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for the given decimal fraction within time limit t.
