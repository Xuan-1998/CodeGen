===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the maximum possible grade for a shorter decimal fraction and then extending it to longer lengths, allowing us to use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values.

The state expression is 'dp[i][j]' where dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to i digits after the decimal point within j seconds.

We initialize dp[0][j] for all j, representing the base case of an empty decimal fraction (no digits after the decimal point).

Then, we iteratively update dp[i][j] based on the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to i-1 digits within j-1 seconds (dp[i-1][j-1]) and the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by not rounding at all within j seconds.

Finally, we return dp[n][t], representing the maximum possible grade for a decimal fraction with n digits after the decimal point, considering only the first t seconds.
