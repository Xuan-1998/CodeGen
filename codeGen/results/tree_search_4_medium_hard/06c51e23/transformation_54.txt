===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization. We can define a recursive function f(n) that returns the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a decimal fraction of length n within time limit t, where f(0) is the initial state representing the grade without rounding.
f(n) = max(f(n-1), 9.99 * (10^(n-1)) + round(0.01 * (10^(n-1)))), for n from 1 to n
We can use memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computations.

Note that we don't need a separate table dp, as the function f(n) will keep track of the maximum possible grade at each step.
