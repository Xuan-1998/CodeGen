===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the maximum possible grade for a shorter decimal fraction and then extending it to longer lengths, allowing us to use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values.

Consider the state expression as 'dp[i]' where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to i digits after the decimal point. Define the base case as dp[0] = 1 since a zero-digit decimal fraction has a maximum possible grade of 1.

Let's define the recurrence relation:

dp[i] is the maximum of the current digit rounded to the nearest integer and the previous maximum grade, considering all options from i-1 to 0.

Use a dynamic programming table (tabulation) where each cell dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to i digits after the decimal point.

Let's iterate through the given time limit t:

For each second in the time limit, consider the current digit of the decimal fraction and calculate the maximum possible grade considering all options from 0 to i-1.

Update dp[i] with the maximum calculated value.

Finally, return dp[n], which represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to n digits after the decimal point within the given time limit t.
