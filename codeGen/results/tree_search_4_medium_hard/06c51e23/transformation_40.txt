===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the maximum possible grade for a shorter decimal fraction and then extending it to longer lengths, allowing us to use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values. 

The state expression is 'state[i][j]' where state[i][j] represents whether it's possible to obtain a certain grade within j seconds when rounding the first i digits after the decimal point, and define the base case as state[0][j] = True for all j since it's always possible to get 0.0 within any time limit.

The recurrence relation would be: if the current digit is less than or equal to (1/2) * (t - j), then we can obtain a higher grade by rounding up, and otherwise, we can't round because the next digits will not make it possible to get a higher grade within t seconds.

However, this plan has an issue as it only considers whether it's possible to get a certain grade or not, but the problem statement asks for the maximum possible grade that can be obtained. 

To fix this, we need to keep track of the maximum possible grade instead of just checking if it's possible to obtain a certain grade.

The updated plan would be:
