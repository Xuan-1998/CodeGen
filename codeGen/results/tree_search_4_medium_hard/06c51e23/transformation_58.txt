===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation. We can initialize a table dp of size n+1 and fill it up iteratively based on the problem constraints, where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.
dp[0] = 0
for i from 1 to n:
    max_grade = 0
    for j from 0 to i-1:
        max_grade = max(max_grade, dp[j] + round(fractional_part[i-j]))
    dp[i] = max_grade
return dp[n]
