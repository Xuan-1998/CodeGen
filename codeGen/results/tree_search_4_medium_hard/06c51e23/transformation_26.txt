This plan takes into account the rounding decision for each digit of the decimal fraction by considering two options: rounding up or rounding down. It also handles edge cases correctly, including the base cases where i = 0 and j = 0. The time complexity is O(n*t), where n is the length of the decimal fraction and t is the time limit.
