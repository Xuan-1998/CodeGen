===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the maximum possible grade for a shorter decimal fraction and then extending it to longer lengths, allowing us to use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values.

The state expression is 'state[i][j]' where state[i][j] represents whether it's possible to obtain a certain grade within j seconds when rounding the first i digits after the decimal point. Define the base case as state[0][j] = True for all j since it's always possible to get 0.0 within any time limit.

state[i][j] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the first i digits after the decimal point within j seconds.

Use a 2D array to represent the state, where each cell contains the result of the dynamic programming subproblem.

For each cell in the state table, calculate the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by:

- Rounding the current digit and recursively calculating the maximum possible grade for the remaining time and decimal places
- Not rounding the current digit and recursively calculating the maximum possible grade for the same time and decimal places

The final answer will be stored in state[n][t].
