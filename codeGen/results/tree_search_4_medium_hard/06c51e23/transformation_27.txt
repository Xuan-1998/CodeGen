===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the maximum possible grade for a shorter decimal fraction and then extending it to longer lengths, allowing us to use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values.

The state expression is 'dp[i][j]' where dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to i digits after the decimal point within j seconds.

Dynamic programming table can be filled by iterating over all possible combinations of rounding decisions for each digit of the decimal fraction.

We will iterate through the decimal fraction from left to right, and at each position, we have two choices: round the current digit or not. This gives us 10^i possibilities for the i-digit suffix after the decimal point.

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where the DP table is filled from smaller subproblems to larger ones, considering all possible rounding decisions for each digit of the decimal fraction.

The base case will be when j = 0, in which case dp[i][j] = 0 for all i. This means that if we run out of time, our maximum grade is 0.

For larger values of j, we can fill up the DP table by considering all possible rounding decisions at each position and recursively calling ourselves with the remaining time and a shorter decimal fraction suffix.
