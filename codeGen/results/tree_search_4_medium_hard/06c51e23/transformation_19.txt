===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the maximum possible grade for a shorter decimal fraction and then extending it to longer lengths, allowing us to use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values.

Let's define dp[i][j] as the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to i digits after the decimal point within j seconds. 

Initially, we set dp[0][j] = 0 for all j since there are no digits after the decimal point for a fraction with zero digits after the decimal point.

For longer lengths, we consider extending the current grade by one digit after the decimal point. We have two options: either round up or not round at all (in this case, the grade remains the same). 

If we decide to round up, we add 1 to the previous maximum possible grade for a shorter decimal fraction and within j-1 seconds. If we don't round, the grade remains the same as before.

We use memoization to store previously computed values in a dictionary dp where the keys are tuples of (i, j) and the values are the corresponding maximum possible grades.

Finally, we return dp[n][t] as the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction within t seconds.
