===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the maximum possible grade for a shorter decimal fraction and then extending it to longer lengths, allowing us to use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values.

Consider the state expression as 'dp[i]' where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to i digits after the decimal point, and define the base case as dp[0] = 1 since a zero-digit decimal fraction has a maximum possible grade of 1.

For each digit at position j in the decimal fraction, calculate the maximum possible grade for rounding it up or down. The maximum possible grade is then the maximum of these two options plus the previous maximum grade considering all options from i-1 to 0.

Apply memoization using a dictionary to store and reuse previously computed values of dp[i].

For each time step t, consider the state expression as 'dp_t[i]' where dp_t[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to i digits after the decimal point within time limit t seconds.

Update the dynamic programming table for each time step t and use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values of dp_t[i].

The final answer is then the maximum value in the dp_t[n] array, where n is the length of the decimal fraction.
