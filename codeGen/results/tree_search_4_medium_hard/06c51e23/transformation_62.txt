===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation. We can initialize a table dp of size n+1 and fill it up iteratively based on the problem constraints, where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.

dp[0] = 0, since we start from an empty string (no rounding)
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], round(fractional_part[i]) - round(fractional_part[i-1])), where fractional_part is the fractional part of the decimal fraction. This step considers the current rounded value and the optimal rounding strategy by comparing it with the original value at each place after the decimal point.

To avoid redundant computations during the iteration process, we can use memoization to store intermediate results in a separate table dp_memo. The update rules would be:

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp_memo[i])
dp_memo[i] = round(fractional_part[i]) - round(fractional_part[i-1])

Consider also handling the edge cases where t is less than the length of the decimal fraction, or if the time limit exceeds 10^9. In these cases, we can return 0 as there's no way to achieve a maximum possible grade within the given time limit.
