This plan correctly uses dynamic programming to solve the problem and includes edge cases. The potential issue with this plan is that it assumes the decimal fraction does not contain any leading zeroes, which was specified as a constraint in the problem statement.

To improve the plan, we can add additional checks to handle the case where the decimal fraction contains leading zeroes. This will require updating the base case and the recursive formula accordingly.
