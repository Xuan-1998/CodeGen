===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the maximum possible grade for a shorter decimal fraction and then extending it to longer lengths, allowing us to use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values.

Consider the state expression as  'dp[i]' where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to i digits after the decimal point. Define the base case as dp[0] = 1 since a zero-digit decimal fraction has a maximum possible grade of 1.

Let's define the recursive function as follows:

- If the current digit is less than or equal to 5, round it down to the nearest integer and add the result to the previous maximum grade.
- If the current digit is greater than 5, round it up to the nearest integer and add the result to the previous maximum grade.

Use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values in the dynamic programming table. This ensures that we don't recalculate the same subproblem multiple times, which can significantly improve performance.

The final answer would be dp[n], where n is the length of the decimal fraction.
