===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation. We can initialize a table dp of size n+1 and fill it up iteratively based on the problem constraints, where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.
We will need to handle two cases: rounding at the current position and not rounding. The dynamic programming recurrence would look like this:
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], round(0.01 * (10^(n-i))) + 9.99 * (10^(n-(i+1))))
Use a dynamic programming table with nested loops to fill up the dp array.
dp[0] is the initial state representing the grade without rounding
The time complexity for this approach would be O(n*t) where n is the length of the decimal fraction and t is the time limit. This could be optimized by only considering the last digit after the decimal point which would reduce the time complexity to O(n).
