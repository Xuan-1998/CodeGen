===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation. We can initialize a table dp of size n+1 and fill it up iteratively based on the problem constraints, where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.

dp[0] = 0; // base case: no rounding needed
for i from 1 to n:
    if (i > t): 
        dp[i] = round(fractional_part[i]); 
    else: 
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], round(fractional_part[i])); 

Determine the optimal rounding strategy by comparing the current rounded value with the original value at each place after the decimal point.
