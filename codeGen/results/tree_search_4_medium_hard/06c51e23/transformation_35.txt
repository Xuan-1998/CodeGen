===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the maximum possible grade for a shorter decimal fraction and then extending it to longer lengths, allowing us to use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values.

Consider the state expression as 'dp[i]' where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to i digits after the decimal point. Define the base case as dp[0] = 1 since a zero-digit decimal fraction has a maximum possible grade of 1.

For each digit in the decimal fraction, calculate the maximum possible grade for that digit and then extend it to longer lengths by considering two cases: either round up or do not round at all. This can be represented as dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-1] + 0.5) where dp[i-1] is the maximum possible grade for i-1 digits after the decimal point.

Implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach using a list dp where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade for i digits after the decimal point.
