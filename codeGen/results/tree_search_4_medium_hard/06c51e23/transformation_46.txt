===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation. We can initialize a table dp of size n+1 and fill it up iteratively based on the problem constraints, where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.

dp[0] = 0 // base case
for i from 1 to n:
    if (i - 1)th digit is less than or equal to 4:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-1] + 9.99 * (10^(n-i)))
    else:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-1] + 0.01 * (10^(n-i)))

return dp[n]
