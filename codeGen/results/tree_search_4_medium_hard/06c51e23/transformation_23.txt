===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the maximum possible grade for a shorter decimal fraction and then extending it to longer lengths, allowing us to use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values.

The state expression is  'dp[i][j]' where dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to i digits after the decimal point within j seconds.

Consider the last digit of the decimal fraction and decide whether to round it up or not based on the remaining time. The state is  'dp[i-1][j-1]' if we don't round it, and  'dp[i][j-1]' if we do.

Implement a recursive function that uses a dictionary to store previously computed values and then iteratively updates the values.
