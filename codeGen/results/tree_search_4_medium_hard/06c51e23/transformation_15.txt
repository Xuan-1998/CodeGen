===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to maximize the grade, consider using a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization. We can define a state as the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a given decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.

dp[i] is the maximum of the previous maximum and the maximum grade that can be obtained by rounding the current digit.
Transition relationship: dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], 10 - (t % 10))

To optimize, we use a hybrid approach that combines both memoization and tabulation techniques. Initialize an array dp with n+1 elements filled with -1 to store the maximum grade for each decimal fraction length.

dp[0] is initialized as 0 because no rounding is required for the integer part.
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], 10 - (t % 10)) if i > 0

Finally, return dp[n] as the maximum possible grade that can be obtained within the given time limit t.
