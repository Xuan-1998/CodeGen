===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the maximum possible grade for a shorter decimal fraction and then extending it to longer lengths, allowing us to use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values.

The state expression is 'dp[i][j]' where dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to i digits after the decimal point within j seconds.
dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible grade for a decimal fraction with i digits after the decimal point, considering only the first j seconds.

Use tabulation to create a 2D table where each cell dp[i][j] is computed as the maximum of not rounding at all (dp[i-1][j]) or rounding once (max(rounded_grade, dp[i-1][j-1])) for each i and j.
Consider the edge case where the decimal fraction has only one digit after the decimal point. In this case, the maximum possible grade is either the current digit or the previous digit.

Incorporate a base case to handle the edge case where i = 0. This can be done by initializing dp[0][j] to j for all j.
