===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the maximum possible grade for a shorter decimal fraction and then extending it to longer lengths, allowing us to use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values.

Consider the state expression as 'dp[i]' where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to i digits after the decimal point, and define the base case as dp[0] = 1 since a zero-digit decimal fraction has a maximum possible grade of 1.

To consider each digit in the decimal fraction separately, calculate the maximum possible grade for each digit by considering two cases: round up or not round. This can be done using a recursive function that calculates the maximum possible grade for each digit and uses memoization to store previously computed values.

Define a recursive function 'func' that takes an integer 'i' as input, representing the current number of digits after the decimal point, and returns the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to i digits after the decimal point. The base case is when i == 0, in which case return dp[0] = 1.

The recursive function 'func' should calculate the maximum possible grade for each digit as follows:

- If the current digit is less than or equal to 4, round it up and recursively call 'func' with the next digit. This is because when a number is rounded up from x.yyyy... to x.(y+1)yyyy..., the value of the decimal fraction increases by at most y.
- If the current digit is greater than 4, do not round it and recursively call 'func' with the next digit.

To handle edge cases, consider the following:
- When the input time limit t is exceeded, return dp[n] as the maximum possible grade that can be obtained within the given time limit.
- When the decimal fraction has fewer digits than the required number of digits after the decimal point n, pad it with leading zeros to reach the required length.
