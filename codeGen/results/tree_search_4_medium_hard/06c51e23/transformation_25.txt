The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the maximum possible grade for a shorter decimal fraction and then extending it to longer lengths, allowing us to use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values.

The state expression is 'dp[i][j]' where dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to i digits after the decimal point within j seconds.

Dynamic programming table can be filled by iterating over all possible combinations of rounding decisions for each digit of the decimal fraction. However, we need to consider the time limit constraint while making these rounding decisions.

To solve this problem effectively, we should fill the DP table in a bottom-up manner from shorter decimal fractions to longer ones and within each length, we can iterate over the decimal fraction from left to right considering all possible rounding decisions at each position. This ensures that we do not exceed the time limit t while making these decisions.

For example, if the given decimal fraction is 123.456, then for i = 3 (i.e., up to 3 digits after the decimal point), we would consider all possible rounding decisions for the first digit (.4 or .5), then for the second digit (.56 or .57), and so on.

The base case for this recursive problem is when i equals n, meaning we have reached the end of the given decimal fraction. In this case, we simply return the maximum grade that can be obtained by rounding the remaining part of the decimal fraction (up to n digits after the decimal point) within t seconds.

Finally, the optimal solution would be the maximum value in the DP table, which represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the given decimal fraction within the given time limit.
