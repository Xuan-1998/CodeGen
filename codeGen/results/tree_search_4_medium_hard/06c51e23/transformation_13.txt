===BEGIN PLAN===
The initial approach seems reasonable for this problem. Here's an updated version with more details and consideration of edge cases:

dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a given decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.

Transition relationship:
- If we don't round, dp[i] = dp[i - 1]
- If we do round, let's say at position j (j = i - 1), 
    - We get an extra grade of 10^(i - 1) for the newly rounded digit
    - However, this takes time t % 10 to perform
    - So, dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[j - 1] + 10^(i - 1) - (t % 10))

Base cases:
- For i = 0, dp[0] = 0, since we can't round anything
- For i > n, dp[i] = dp[n], as there's no more decimal place to consider

Memoization is essential here because calculating dp[i] requires knowing the values of dp[j] for j < i. This helps in avoiding redundant calculations and optimizing the solution.
