===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation. We can initialize a table dp of size n+1 and fill it up iteratively based on the problem constraints, where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.
We need to add a condition to handle the case where rounding the fractional part results in an integer value that exceeds the time limit t. If this happens, we cannot round further and should stick with the previous rounded value.
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], min(round(fractional_part[i]), t)).
To fill up the table, iterate from i=n to i=0. For each i, calculate dp[i] using the above formula and store it in the table.
Use a top-down dynamic programming approach with recursion and memoization to fill up a table of size n+1 only if the bottom-up approach is not feasible due to constraints on memory usage.
Initializing a 2D table with time limit t as an additional dimension to account for the constraint.
