===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the maximum possible grade for a shorter decimal fraction and then extending it to longer lengths, allowing us to use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values.

Consider the state expression as 'dp[i]' where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to i digits after the decimal point. We can define the base case as dp[0] = 1 since a zero-digit decimal fraction has a maximum possible grade of 1.

The recursive relation for dp[i] would be:

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], round_up_to_i(digits_after_decimal))

where round_up_to_i(digits_after_decimal) is the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the digits after the i-th decimal place up to i places, and digits_after_decimal is the substring of the original decimal fraction from the (i+1)-th digit after the decimal point onwards.

We can implement a memoization function using a decorator to store and reuse previously computed values. This will significantly reduce the time complexity of our solution by avoiding redundant computations.

The final answer would be dp[n], which represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the original decimal fraction up to n places after the decimal point within the given time limit t.
