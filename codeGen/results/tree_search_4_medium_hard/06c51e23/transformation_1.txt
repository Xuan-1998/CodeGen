===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to maximize the grade, consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with memoization. We can define a state as dp[i][j] = maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a given decimal fraction of length i, within time limit t and considering the first j digits.
The base case is dp[0][0] = 0, since there are no digits to round.

dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a given decimal fraction of length i, within time limit t, considering all possible rounding choices at the ith digit and the first j digits.
Use dynamic programming with memoization and recursive function calls to store and reuse intermediate results.

The recurrence relation would be:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], round(dp[i-1][j]) + 1)

where dp[i-1][j] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a given decimal fraction of length i-1, within time limit t and considering the first j digits.

The function to calculate the maximum possible grade would be:

max_grade(n, t) {
    int memo[n+1][t+1];
    memset(memo, 0, sizeof(memo));
    for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        for(int j = 0; j <= t; j++) {
            if(i == 0 || j == 0) continue;
            memo[i][j] = max(memo[i-1][j], round(memo[i-1][j]) + 1);
        }
    }
    return memo[n][t];
}
