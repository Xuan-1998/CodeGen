===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation. We can initialize a table dp of size n+1 and fill it up iteratively based on the problem constraints, where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.

dp[0] = 0 (base case), as there's no fractional part to round.
For each i from 1 to n:
    dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], round(fractional_part[i])), where fractional_part is the fractional part of the decimal fraction. This step accounts for the option of not rounding at all, or rounding the current digit.

To further optimize the process, we can consider a variant of the classic "rounding" problem, where we try to maximize the rounded value without exceeding t seconds.
