===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation. We can initialize a table dp of size n+1 and fill it up iteratively based on the problem constraints, where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.
We need to consider two cases: rounding and not rounding at each place after the decimal point. For rounding, we assume that the student will round the last digit (0.01 * (10^(n-1))) as 5 if it is between 0.5 and 1.4 or greater than or equal to 1.5.
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], round(0.01 * (10^(n-i)) + (i < n) ? dp[i-1] : 9.99 * (10^(n-i))), for i from 1 to n, where dp[0] is the initial state representing the grade without rounding.
Implement memoization using a dictionary to store and reuse intermediate results.
To ensure that we handle edge cases correctly, consider initializing dp[0] = 0, as there's no grade for an empty decimal fraction.
