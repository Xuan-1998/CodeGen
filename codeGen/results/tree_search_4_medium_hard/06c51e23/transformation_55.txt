===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation. We can initialize a table dp of size n+1 and fill it up iteratively based on the problem constraints, where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.

The base case is when i = 0, dp[0] should be set to 0. Then, we iterate from i = 1 to n and update dp[i] as follows:

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], round(fractional_part[i])), where fractional_part is the fractional part of the decimal fraction.

However, this plan does not consider the time limit constraint t. We need to adjust our approach to ensure that we are considering only the possible rounding decisions within the given time limit.

One way to do this is to maintain a separate table, say available_time, where available_time[i] represents the maximum grade that can be obtained for a decimal fraction of length i within the remaining time limit. We update this table iteratively based on the problem constraints and the previous values in the dp and available_time tables.

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], round(fractional_part[i]), available_time[i])

We also need to ensure that we do not exceed the given time limit t while making these rounding decisions. We can achieve this by maintaining a variable, say remaining_time, which represents the remaining time after each decision is made.

available_time[0] = 0
for i from 1 to n:
    available_time[i] = min(available_time[i-1], round(fractional_part[i])) + 1

Then, we iterate from i = 1 to n and update dp[i] as follows:

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], round(fractional_part[i]), available_time[i])

Finally, the maximum possible grade that can be obtained is given by dp[n].
