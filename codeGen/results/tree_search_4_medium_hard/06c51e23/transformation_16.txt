===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to maximize the grade, consider using a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization. We can define a state as the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a given decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.

dp[i] is the maximum of the previous maximum and the maximum grade that can be obtained by rounding the current digit.
where t % 10 is the remaining seconds in the current minute. 

Using a dictionary to store previously computed values for memoization.

For each possible round, we calculate the new remaining time t_new = max(0, t - 1) as the student will spend at least one second on rounding. Then we update dp[i] with the maximum of its current value and the grade that can be obtained by rounding the current digit.

Finally, return dp[n] as the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for the given decimal fraction within time limit t.
