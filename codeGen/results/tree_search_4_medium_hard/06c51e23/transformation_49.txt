===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation. We can initialize a table dp of size n+1 and fill it up iteratively based on the problem constraints, where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.

dp[0] = 0
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], round(10^i) + dp[i-1]) for i from 1 to n

Consider rounding down at each step, as we are maximizing the grade. This is because if we were to round up, it would reduce our chances of getting a higher grade.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the decimal fraction.
