The provided plan is generally correct and uses dynamic programming with memoization correctly. Here's an improved version of the plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
State: dp[i]: Maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a given decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.

1. Initialize dp[0] to 0, since there's no decimal part initially.
2. Iterate over the decimal fraction from left to right:
    - For each digit i (from 1 to n):
        - Calculate the current maximum possible grade by rounding the current digit and adding it to the previous maximum grade (dp[i-1]).
        - Update dp[i] as the maximum of the current value and the previous maximum grade.
3. Since we need to find the maximum grade within time limit t, keep track of the maximum possible grade that can be obtained in t seconds.
4. The final answer will be the maximum of all the grades obtained for each digit.

This plan correctly captures the essence of dynamic programming with memoization and should work well for solving the problem.

===END PLAN===
