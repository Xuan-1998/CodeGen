===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation. We can initialize a table dp of size n+1 and fill it up iteratively based on the problem constraints, where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.

dp[0] = 0 (base case)
for i from 1 to n:
    if i <= t:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], round(fractional_part[i])) // consider rounding at the current position
    else:
        dp[i] = dp[i-1]

Choose a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation, where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.
