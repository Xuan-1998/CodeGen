===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to maximize the grade, consider using a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization. We can define a state as the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a given decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.

The base case is dp[0] = 0, since there are no digits to round.
dp[i] is the maximum of two cases: (1) do not round the ith digit and move on to the next one, dp[i-1]; or (2) round the ith digit up or down, which adds/deducts a value from dp[i-1].

Consider using a helper function to calculate the change in grade when rounding the ith digit. This can be done by calculating the maximum possible value and minimum possible value of the ith digit and the corresponding changes.

To improve the plan, consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach instead. This can reduce the time complexity since we only need to calculate the states as we go along.

The potential issue with the plan is that it does not take into account the time limit t. We should ensure that our DP algorithm takes this into account and calculates the maximum possible grade within the given time limit.

Edge cases: The plan assumes that the decimal fraction has at least one digit after the decimal point, which is ensured by the problem constraint.
