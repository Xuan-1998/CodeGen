===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to maximize the grade, consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with memoization. We can define a state as the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a given decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.

The base case is dp[0] = 0, since there are no digits to round.
Consider all possible rounding choices for the ith digit and update dp[i] accordingly. For example, if the ith digit is 4 or greater, we can round up to get 5, while if it's less than 4 but greater than or equal to 2, we can round down to get 0.

To reduce the number of states, consider using a dictionary to store the maximum grade for each decimal fraction length and update accordingly. We can also use this dictionary to avoid recomputing the same values multiple times.

The time complexity should be O(n*t) where n is the length of the decimal fraction and t is the time limit. The space complexity should be O(n) due to the dictionary storing the maximum grade for each decimal fraction length.
