===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the maximum possible grade for a shorter decimal fraction and then extending it to longer lengths, allowing us to use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values.

The state expression is 'dp[i][j]' where dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to i digits after the decimal point within j seconds.

Consider the last digit of the decimal fraction and decide whether to round it up or not based on the remaining time. The state is 'dp[i-1][j-1]' if we don't round it, and 'dp[i][j-1]' if we do.

Utilize a 2D array to store the tabulated values where dp[i][j] stores the maximum possible grade for i digits after the decimal point within j seconds. The initial state is 'dp[0][t]', which represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained without rounding any part of the decimal fraction, given the remaining time t.

The problem can be solved by iteratively filling up the 2D array 'dp' in a bottom-up manner, starting from the base case where i = 1 and j = t. The recursive formula is:

* If we don't round the last digit, the maximum possible grade is dp[i-1][j-1]
* If we do round the last digit, the maximum possible grade is max(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j] + 1)

The final answer will be stored in 'dp[n][t]', which represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the given decimal fraction within the given time limit.
