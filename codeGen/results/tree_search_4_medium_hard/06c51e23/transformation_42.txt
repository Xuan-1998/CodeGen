===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the maximum possible grade for a shorter decimal fraction and then extending it to longer lengths, allowing us to use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values.

The state expression is 'state[i][j]' where state[i][j] represents whether it's possible to obtain a certain grade within j seconds when rounding the first i digits after the decimal point, and define the base case as state[0][j] = True for all j since it's always possible to get 0.0 within any time limit.

'state[i][j]' is True if it's possible to obtain a certain grade within j seconds when rounding the first i digits after the decimal point, and False otherwise.

To improve the plan, we can consider using a priority queue to store the subproblems that are being processed and then process the ones with the earliest deadline first. This could help reduce the time complexity of the solution.

One potential issue with the plan is that it assumes that all digits after the decimal point have an equal effect on the maximum possible grade, which might not be true in practice. For example, if the fraction has a large number of trailing zeros, these would not affect the maximum possible grade.

To include edge cases, we should consider what happens when j = 0 and i > 0. In this case, state[i][j] would be False since it's not possible to obtain any grade within no time limit.

Here is the updated version of the plan:
