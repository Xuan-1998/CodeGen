===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the maximum possible grade for a shorter decimal fraction and then extending it to longer lengths, allowing us to use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values.

The state expression is  'dp[i][j]' where dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to i digits after the decimal point within j seconds.

Consider the last digit of the decimal fraction and decide whether to round it up or not based on the remaining time. The state is  'dp[i-1][j-1]' if we don't round it, and  'dp[i][j-1]' if we do.

Use a dictionary to store the memoized values with  'dp[i][j]' as keys.

When updating the dp array, we need to consider the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the decimal fraction up to i digits after the decimal point within j seconds. This involves considering all possible ways of rounding the last digit of the decimal fraction and choosing the one that results in the highest grade.

We also need to handle edge cases such as when the remaining time is less than the time required to round a single digit, in which case we cannot round any digits and our maximum possible grade is simply the maximum possible grade for the integer part of the decimal fraction.

Finally, we initialize the dp array with base cases where i=0 or j=0. This allows us to compute the values for larger values of i and j by combining the results of smaller subproblems.
