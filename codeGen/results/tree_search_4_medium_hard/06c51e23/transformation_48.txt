===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation. We can initialize a table dp of size n+1 and fill it up iteratively based on the problem constraints, where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.
dp[0] = 0
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], min(dp[i-1] + 9.99 * (10^(n-i)), round(0.01 * (10^(n-i)))), for i from 1 to n, where round(x) is the closest integer to x.
The time limit t should be considered while calculating dp[i]. We can use a variable time_left initialized with t and update it accordingly while filling up the table.
We should also keep track of the optimal rounding points using a separate table, say rounding_points. This will help us calculate the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by summing up the grades at each rounding point.
Finally, we return dp[n] as the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for the given decimal fraction within the time limit t.
