===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to maximize the grade, consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with memoization. We can define a state as the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a given decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.
dp[i][t] is the maximum of the previous maximum and the maximum grade that can be obtained by rounding the current digit, considering the remaining time t.

State: dp[i][t]: Maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a given decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.

Design a recursive function that takes the current decimal fraction, time limit, and the current position as inputs, uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations, and returns the maximum possible grade.
For each digit in the decimal fraction:
    - If it is greater than or equal to 5, round up and decrement the remaining time by 1
    - If it is less than 5, do not round and decrement the remaining time by 1
Return the maximum possible grade that can be obtained within the given time limit.
