===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to maximize the grade, consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with memoization. We can define a state as the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a given decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.

The base case is dp[0] = 0, since there are no digits to round.

Consider all possible rounding choices for the ith digit and update dp[i] accordingly. For example, if the ith digit is 4 or greater, we can round up to get 5, while if it's less than 4 but greater than or equal to 2, we can round down to get 0.

Initialize a dictionary memo with base case dp[0] = 0 and iterate through all decimal fractions of length i from 1 to n. For each ith digit:

- Calculate the possible rounded value based on the rounding rules.
- Update dp[i] as the maximum of its current value and the maximum grade that can be obtained by rounding the (i - 1)th digit.

Use memoization to store the maximum grade for each subproblem, updating it only once. This way, we avoid recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.
