===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the maximum possible grade for a shorter decimal fraction and then extending it to longer lengths, allowing us to use memoization to store and reuse previously computed values.

Let's define the state expression as 'state[i][j]' where state[i][j] represents whether it's possible to obtain a certain grade within j seconds when rounding the first i digits after the decimal point. Define the base case as state[0][j] = True for all j since it's always possible to get 0.0 within any time limit.

state[i][j] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding the first i digits after the decimal point within j seconds.

Use a dictionary to store the memoized values and perform lookups based on the current state of the problem.

For each state, calculate the maximum possible grade by considering two options: 

1. Round up the current digit and recursively explore the subproblem with one less digit and j - 1 time units left.
2. Don't round the current digit and recursively explore the subproblem with the same number of digits and j time units left.

Choose the option that results in a higher grade. If it's impossible to obtain any grade within the given time limit, return 0.

The plan can be improved by optimizing the recursive function calls by using memoization.
