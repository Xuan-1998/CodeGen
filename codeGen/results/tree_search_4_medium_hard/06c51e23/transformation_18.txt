===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to maximize the grade, consider using a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization. We can define a state as the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a given decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.

dp[i] is the maximum of the previous maximum and the maximum grade that can be obtained by rounding the current digit.
where t % 10 is the remaining seconds in the current minute. 

To make it more efficient, we can use a two-dimensional array dp[i][k], where dp[i][k] is the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a given decimal fraction of length i with k digits after the decimal point within time limit t.

Creating a recursive function with memoization to store and reuse intermediate results. For example:
    if t % 10 <= 0, we have enough time to round this digit; otherwise, we don't.
    If rounding is possible, calculate the grade for both rounded and non-rounded cases and choose the maximum.
    
The base case would be when i = 1 (only one decimal place), where the maximum possible grade can be obtained by simply considering the value of that single digit.
