===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with tabulation. We can initialize a table dp of size n+1 and fill it up iteratively based on the problem constraints, where dp[i] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a decimal fraction of length i within time limit t.

dp[0] = 0, since no rounding is needed for a whole number
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], round(fractional_part[i-1])), where fractional_part is the fractional part of the decimal fraction.

However, this plan is not entirely correct as it only considers rounding at each place after the decimal point. We need to consider the time taken to calculate the rounded value and ensure that the total time taken does not exceed the given time limit t.

To fix this issue, we can use a two-dimensional dp array dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a decimal fraction of length i within j seconds. The base case remains the same: dp[0][j] = 0, since no rounding is needed for a whole number.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] + round(fractional_part[i-1]), where k = min(j, t_taken_to_calculate_rounded_value)) and t_taken_to_calculate_rounded_value is the time taken to calculate the rounded value at each place after the decimal point. This ensures that we do not exceed the given time limit.

Implement dynamic programming with memoization by combining both approaches to efficiently calculate the maximum possible grade.
