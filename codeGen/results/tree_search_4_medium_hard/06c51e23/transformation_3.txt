dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], round Fraction(i) + dp[i-1])
where:
    - i is the current digit position (0-indexed)
    - roundFraction(i) is the maximum possible grade that can be obtained by rounding at the ith digit
    - dp[i-1] is the maximum possible grade that can be obtained for a given decimal fraction of length i-1 within time limit t
