===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether there exist two sequences, one with lengths that are either all even or all odd, such that their concatenation forms sequence $b$.

dp[i] = min(dp[j] + (b[i] == len(a)) for j in range(i)) for i from 0 to n-1
Consider a state where the last element of the sequence $a$ is even or odd, and determine whether it's possible to find another state that satisfies the condition.

Create a memoized function with a dictionary

Initialize dp array as [False] * (n + 1), set dp[0] = True, and then iterate through b from left to right. For each element in b:

    If b[i] is even, check if there's a previous even length that can be concatenated with it to form the current sequence.
        Check for all odd lengths and see if they can be added to the current sequence.

If b[i] is odd, check if there's a previous odd length that can be concatenated with it to form the current sequence.
    Check for all even lengths and see if they can be added to the current sequence.

If either condition holds true, update dp[i + 1].

Finally, return "YES" if dp[n] is True; otherwise, return "NO".
