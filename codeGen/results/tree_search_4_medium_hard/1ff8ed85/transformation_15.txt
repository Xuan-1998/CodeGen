===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.

Define the state expression as a tuple (n, prev_val) where n is the current length of sequence b and prev_val is the previous value in sequence b.

If we have a valid transition from the previous state, it means we found a way to split the previous segment into segments with lengths in sequence b, so we can recursively call the function on the previous state.

Tabulation using Bottom-Up Approach: Initialize a table with size (n+1) * 10^9, fill it up based on the previous state, and then check if the target sequence is achievable from the initial state.

For each state in the table, iterate through all possible values in sequence b to see if there's a valid transition. If there is, mark that state as reachable.

Finally, start from the initial state (0, -1) and check if the target sequence is reachable. If it is, print "YES", otherwise "NO".
