===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether there exist two sequences, one with lengths that are either all even or all odd, such that their concatenation forms sequence $b$.

dp[i] = min(dp[j] + (sum([len(a)] + [a[i-j]])) for j in range(i)) for i from 0 to n-1

Think about how the lengths of the segments in sequence $a$ relate to each other, and try to formulate a recursive relationship between these states.

Using a dynamic programming table to store whether each length can be reached
