===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.

The state expression could be a dictionary {val: freq} mapping each value to its frequency in sequence a, with the base case being when the input sequence contains all values.

The state is the tuple (current_segment_length, segment_count) representing the current length of the segment in a and the number of segments formed so far.

You can use a list to keep track of all previously encountered values and their corresponding counts, and then check if the current segment can be formed by concatenating these segments with different lengths.

To further improve the plan:

*   Initialize the dictionary and list with the base case when the input sequence contains all values.
*   Iterate over the sequence $b$ to find the possible segment lengths in $a$. For each value in $b$, check if it can be formed by concatenating previously encountered segments of different lengths. If it can, update the state accordingly.
