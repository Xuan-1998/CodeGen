===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.

Define the state expression as a tuple (n, prev_val) where n is the current length of sequence b and prev_val is the previous value in sequence b.

The dynamic programming state will be a boolean array dp where dp[i] represents whether the subsequence from index 0 to i in sequence b can be obtained from some subsequence of a. We'll initialize all elements to False, as we haven't seen any subsequences yet.

For each element in sequence b, check if its value is equal to prev_val + 1 (or -prev_val - 1 for decreasing segments). If so, update the dp state accordingly.
