===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.

The state expression could be a dictionary {val: freq} mapping each value to its frequency in sequence a, with the base case being when the input sequence contains all values.
Define a dictionary state_dict where the keys are tuples (current_segment_length, segment_count) and the values are booleans indicating whether sequence b can be formed with the given state.

Memoized bottom-up dynamic programming: Define a dictionary dp where each cell dp[i] represents whether sequence b can be formed from the first i elements of sequence a.

Define an initial value for each dp cell based on whether the segment length in sequence $a$ is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in sequence $b$. Then, update each dp cell recursively by considering the following cases:
    - If the current segment length in sequence $a$ matches the current element in sequence $b$, mark this as a successful step.
    - If the current segment length in sequence $a$ is greater than the current element in sequence $b$, ignore this case and continue to the next one.
    - If the current segment length in sequence $a$ is less than the current element in sequence $b$, update dp[i] based on whether it can be formed from the remaining elements of sequence $a$.

Finally, return YES if dp[n] is true (sequence b can be formed), and NO otherwise.
