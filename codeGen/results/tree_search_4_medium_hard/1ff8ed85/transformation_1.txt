===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.
Define the state expression as a tuple (n, prev_val) where n is the current length of sequence b and prev_val is the previous value in sequence b.

Transition relationship:
- If the current length of sequence b is less than or equal to the current value, it's possible to split sequence a into segments and write the length of each segment to the left of it. 
- If the current length of sequence b is greater than the current value, it's not possible because the lengths would be written on the right.

Memoization:
Use a dictionary dp to memoize the results of previously computed subproblems and avoid redundant computation.
The key in the dictionary will be (n, prev_val) and the value will be True or False based on whether it's possible to split sequence a into segments and write the lengths to the left or right.

Main function:
- Initialize dp with default values as False.
- Iterate over each element in sequence b.
- For each element, check if it's possible to split sequence a into segments and write the length of each segment to the left or right based on the transition relationship.
- If it's possible, update the value in dp for the corresponding state.
