===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether there exist two sequences, one with lengths that are either all even or all odd, such that their concatenation forms sequence $b$.

dp[i][j] = (all lengths of b[:i+1] are even) and j == 0 or (all lengths of b[:i+1] are odd) and j == 1 for i from 0 to n-1

Fill the dp table in linear time O(n). For each element dp[i][j], consider two possibilities:
- The last segment is even
- The last segment is odd

Initialize dp[0][0] = True (or any value that represents "sequence b can be obtained") and dp[0][1] = False.
For i from 1 to n-1, check if the length of b[i] is even or odd. If it's even, set dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] and dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][0]. If it's odd, set dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][1] and dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][1].
Finally, check if the last element of sequence b is even or odd. If it's even, return dp[n-1][0], otherwise return dp[n-1][1].
