===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.

The state expression could be a dictionary {val: freq} mapping each value to its frequency in sequence $a$, with the base case being when the input sequence contains all values.

Define a dictionary state_dict where the keys are tuples (current_segment_length, segment_count) and the values are booleans indicating whether sequence $b$ can be formed with the given state.

Iterative approach: Create a table dp where each cell dp[i][j] represents whether sequence $b$ can be formed from the first i elements of sequence $a$, considering j as the current segment length.

For each cell, check if the current value in sequence $b$ is equal to the current segment length. If it's not, skip this value and move on to the next one. If it is, then consider two cases: either the segment count increments or decrements by 1. Calculate the new state_dict key based on these two cases.

Fill up the table dp from top-left to bottom-right, using the base case when i equals n (the length of sequence $b$). Finally, check if there's any cell where state_dict is True; if so, return YES; otherwise, return NO.
