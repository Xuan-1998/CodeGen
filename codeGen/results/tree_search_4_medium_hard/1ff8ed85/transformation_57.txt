===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether there exist two sequences, one with lengths that are either all even or all odd, such that their concatenation forms sequence $b$.

dp[i] = min(dp[j] + (b[0:i+1] == b) for j in range(i)) for i from 0 to n-1

Maintain a running sum of sequence $a$'s lengths mod 2, checking if at any point it matches sequence $b$
