===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.

Define the state expression as a tuple (n, prev_val) where n is the current length of sequence b and prev_val is the previous value in sequence b.

Transition relationship:
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], len + prev_val) if i > 0
dp[0] = 0

Implement tabulation using a 1D array, where each element dp[i] stores the maximum length of sequence a that can produce the first i elements of sequence b.

Iterate through the sequence and update dp values as follows:
for i in range(1, n+1):
    for j in range(i):
        if b[j] == prev_val:
            len = i - j
            break
    dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], len + prev_val)

Return YES if dp[n] > 0 and NO otherwise.
