===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to determine if it's possible to send sequence $b$, given constraints on the length and value of each segment in sequence $a$.

Define the state as a tuple (i, p) where i is the current index in sequence $b$ and p is the prefix of the corresponding sequence $a$. This can be represented by (b_index, a_prefix) where b_index is the current index in sequence $b$ and a_prefix is the current segment being processed in sequence $a$.

Employ a 2D table dp[i][p] where each cell represents whether it's possible to send the prefix $b[:i+1]$ given segment p in sequence $a$. The base case can be handled by initializing dp[0][0] as True, since an empty sequence can always be sent over the network.

The recursive relationship for the dynamic programming table can be defined as follows:

- If b_index is out of bounds or if a_prefix is not valid according to the constraints (i.e., its length does not match with $b[b_index]$), set dp[i][p] as False.
- Otherwise, iterate over all possible segments that can be split from a_prefix. For each segment s, check if it's possible to send prefix $b[:i+1]$ given segment s by recursively calling the function with updated values of i and p (i.e., b_index + len(s) and s concatenated with a_prefix). If any of these recursive calls return True, set dp[i][p] as True. Otherwise, set it as False.

Finally, iterate over all test cases and for each test case, check if the base case dp[n-1][b] is True. If it is, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".
