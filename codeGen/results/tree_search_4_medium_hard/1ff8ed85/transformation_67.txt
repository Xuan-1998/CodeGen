===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a recursive approach to determine if it's possible to send sequence $b$, given constraints on the length and value of each segment in sequence $a$.

Define the state as a pair (i, p) where i is the current index in sequence b and p is the prefix of the corresponding sequence a. This allows us to keep track of the current position in both sequences.

To memoize function calls, use a dictionary or list with keys of type (i, p) and values representing whether it's possible to send the remaining part of sequence $b$ given the current state.

The base case for the recursion is when the entire sequence $b$ has been processed, so we return True if that's the case. Otherwise, check all possible segment lengths for the current position in sequence $a$, and recursively call the function with the updated state and prefix.

To avoid infinite recursion, ensure that each recursive call moves closer to the end of both sequences. This can be done by checking the maximum allowed length of a segment and returning False if it's exceeded.

Memoize all possible states at the beginning to speed up computation. Update memoization table as you process each state.
