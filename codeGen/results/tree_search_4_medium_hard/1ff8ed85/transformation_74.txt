===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a recursive approach to determine if it's possible to send sequence $b$, given constraints on the length and value of each segment in sequence $a$.

Define the state as a tuple (i, p) where i is the current index in sequence b and p is the prefix of the corresponding sequence a.

State can be represented by (b_index, a_segment) where b_index is the current index in sequence b and a_segment is the current segment being processed in sequence a.

Dynamically maintain a set of previously used prefixes and their corresponding segments for memoization.
