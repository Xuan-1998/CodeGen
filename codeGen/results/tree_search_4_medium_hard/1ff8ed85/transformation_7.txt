===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.

State: (n, prev_val) where n is the current length of sequence b and prev_val is the previous value in sequence b.

Memoization:
Maintain a 1D memoization dictionary memo to store the values of the dynamic programming table, and update it accordingly as you fill up the table.

Memoization rules:
- If (n, 0) exists in memo, return True
- If (n, prev_val) exists in memo and prev_val is valid for sequence b, return memo[(n, prev_val)]
- Calculate dp_value based on previous values in memo and check if it's a valid combination to get sequence b
- Store dp_value in memo and update the result

Base case:
If n == 0, return True (empty sequence can be obtained)

Main function:
For each test case:
    For each value in sequence b:
        Initialize dp_value = 1 and prev_val = 0
        Perform dynamic programming until n reaches 0
        If final dp_value is valid for sequence b, print YES; otherwise, print NO
