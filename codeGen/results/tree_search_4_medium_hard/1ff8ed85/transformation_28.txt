===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.

State: dp[j] = True if the last j elements of sequence a can be sent over the network to get sequence b.
Transition relationship: dp[j] = or (dp[j-1] and a[j-1] == b[k]) for some k, where k ranges from 0 to j-1.

Use a 2D table to store whether the subsequence ending at each position can be sent over the network. Initialize dp[][] with False values.
For i = 1 to n:
    For j = 1 to i:
        If j == 1 or (dp[j-1] and a[i-1] == b[i]):
            dp[i][j] = True
        Else:
            dp[i][j] = False

In the end, return dp[n][n] as the final answer.
