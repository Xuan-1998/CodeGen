===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.

Define the state expression as a tuple (n, prev_val) where n is the current length of sequence b and prev_val is the previous value in sequence b.

State
Use a 2D array with size (10^5 + 1) * (10^9 + 1) where each cell [i][j] represents whether there exists a way to get the subsequence of length i ending at value j from sequence a.

If the current segment in sequence b is less than or equal to the previous value, it means we can simply copy the previous segment into the current one.
Use dynamic programming to fill up the 2D array. For each cell [i][j], check if there exists a way to get the subsequence of length i-1 ending at value j-prev_val (or j if prev_val is 0).
If yes, then we can add the previous segment to the current one and increment the length by 1.
If not, then it's impossible to get this subsequence from sequence a.

Return YES if the cell [n][b_n] in the array is True, otherwise return NO.
