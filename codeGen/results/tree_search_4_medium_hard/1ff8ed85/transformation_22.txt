===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.
The base case could be when n == 0 or prev_val is not present in sequence a.
State: dp[i][j] = True if sequence b[1..i] can be obtained from sequence a[1..j].
Transition relationship: dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][k] and j-k+1 == b[i]) for all k such that 0 <= k <= j.
Use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming states, where dp[i][j] represents whether sequence b[1..i] can be obtained from sequence a[1..j].
If b[i] is less than or equal to prev_val then we don't need to consider any segments that end with value less than or equal to prev_val.
