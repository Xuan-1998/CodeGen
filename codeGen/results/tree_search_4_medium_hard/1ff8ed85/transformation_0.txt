===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.

Define the state expression as a tuple (n, prev_val) where n is the current length of sequence b and prev_val is the previous value in sequence b.

Transition relationship:
    * Initialize an array dp with size 2*10^5 + 1 and all values initialized to -1
    * Iterate over sequence b from left to right
        - For each element b_i, iterate over possible previous values in sequence a (from 1 to b_i)
            - If the difference between b_i and prev_val is less than or equal to the current length of sequence a, update dp[n] = 1
            - Else, update dp[n] = 0
        - Update n = n + 1 and prev_val = b_i

Return YES if dp[n-1] == 1; otherwise return NO.
