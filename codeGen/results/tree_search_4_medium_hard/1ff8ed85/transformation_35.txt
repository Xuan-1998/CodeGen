===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.

The state expression could be a dictionary {val: freq} mapping each value to its frequency in sequence $a$, with the base case being when the input sequence contains all values.

The transition relationship is defined as: if the next value in $b$ matches the current_segment_length + 1, then update the segment_count by incrementing it; otherwise, start a new segment and reset current_segment_length to 1.

Think about using a list to keep track of the cumulative sum of lengths in sequence $a$, and update it as you iterate through sequence $b$. Consider maintaining two lists: one for the cumulative sum and another for the frequency count.

Use dynamic programming to fill up a table with the minimum number of segments needed to form each prefix of sequence $b$.

The base case is when the length of the current segment is greater than or equal to the next value in $b$. In this case, we can directly construct the segment by adding the difference between the current and the next values to the cumulative sum.

For the transition cases, consider using a greedy approach: always try to extend the current segment if possible, and start a new one otherwise. This ensures that the number of segments is minimized.

The final result would be the minimum number of segments needed to form sequence $b$, which can be obtained from the last cell in the table.
