===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.

Define the state expression as a tuple (n, prev_val) where n is the current length of sequence b and prev_val is the previous value in sequence b.

Transition relationship:
    - If the current element in sequence b is equal to the previous value, then it can be obtained from sequence a by writing the length of each segment to the left.
    - If the current element in sequence b is not equal to the previous value, then it can be obtained from sequence a by writing the length of each segment to the right.

Memoization:
    - Store previously computed values in a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents whether the first i elements in sequence b can be obtained from sequence a when the current segment has j as its length.
    - Initialize all entries in dp as False, except for dp[0][0] which is True.

Tabulation:
    - Start iterating over each element in sequence b, and for each element, check if it can be obtained from sequence a based on the transition relationship.
    - If it can, then update dp[n][prev_val] to True and n -= 1; otherwise, update n = 0 and prev_val = 0.

Edge cases:
    - Handle edge cases such as an empty sequence b or when all elements in sequence b are equal. In these cases, the answer is YES if sequence a exists.
