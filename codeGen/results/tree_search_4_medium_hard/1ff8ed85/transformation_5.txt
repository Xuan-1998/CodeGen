===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.

Define the state expression as a tuple (n, prev_val) where n is the current length of sequence b and prev_val is the previous value in sequence b.

The transition relation will be dp[n][prev_val] = 1 if there exists a previous total' such that total - total' is a value in sequence b and n-1 is the last segment's length, otherwise it'll be 0.

Design a bottom-up approach using nested loops to fill up the dp table. Initialize the dp table with zeros for all values of n and prev_val.

Start by initializing the base case: dp[1][b_1] = 1 if b_1 is in sequence b; otherwise, dp[1][b_1] = 0. Then, iterate over the sequence b from right to left:

For each value b_i in the reverse order of sequence b:
    For each possible previous value prev_val in the range [1, b_i]:
        Calculate total = b_i - prev_val.
        Check if total is in sequence b and n-1 is a valid segment length. If so, update dp[n][prev_val] = 1; otherwise, leave it as 0.

Finally, iterate over the sequence b from left to right:

For each value b_i in sequence b:
    For each possible previous value prev_val in the range [1, b_i]:
        Calculate total = sum of all values in sequence b up to and including b_i.
        Check if dp[n-1][prev_val] is 1 for some n-1. If so, update dp[n][prev_val] = 1; otherwise, leave it as 0.

The answer will be YES if there exists a previous value prev_val such that dp[n][prev_val] = 1; otherwise, the answer will be NO.
