===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.

The state expression could be a dictionary {val: freq} mapping each value to its frequency in sequence $a$, with the base case being when the input sequence contains all values.

The state is the tuple (current_segment_length, segment_count) representing the current length of the segment in $a$ and the number of segments formed so far.

You can use a dynamic programming table to store the results of subproblems, where each cell in the table represents whether the segment up to that point in sequence $a$ can be used to form the current segment in sequence $b$. Initialize the table with base cases for shorter sequences. 

Update the table by considering the last value in sequence $b$, and checking if it's equal to or greater than the length of the current segment in $a$. If so, increment the frequency of that value in the state dictionary.

Finally, iterate over each cell in the table and check if the state (current_segment_length, segment_count) satisfies the condition for forming a valid sequence. If it does, return YES; otherwise, return NO.
