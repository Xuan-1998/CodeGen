===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine whether there exist two sequences, one with lengths that are either all even or all odd, such that their concatenation forms sequence $b$.

dp[i] = (exists two sequences a1 and a2 such that their concatenation forms b[:i] and the lengths of a1, a2 are either both even or both odd) for i from 0 to n-1

Using a boolean array to store whether each subsequence is formable by concatenating two sequences with all even or all odd lengths.

For i from 0 to n-1:
    For j from 0 to i:
        If b[j] is even, dp[i] = dp[i] || (dp[j] && (b[j+1:i+1].length() is even or b[j+1:i+1].length() is odd))
        Else
            dp[i] = dp[i] || (dp[j] && (b[j+1:i+1].length() is odd or b[j+1:i+1].length() is even))

For i from 0 to n-1:
    If dp[i] then print YES, else print NO
