===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a bottom-up dynamic programming approach using a 2D table dp[][] where dp[i][j] is true if it's possible to send sequence b up to index i using prefix p of length j in sequence a.

Define the state as a pair (i, p) where i is the current index in sequence b and p is the prefix of the corresponding sequence a.

State can be represented by (b_index, a_segment) where b_index is the current index in sequence b and a_segment is the current segment being processed in sequence a.

Initialize dp[][] with all values as false. For each element dp[i][j], compute its value based on the following rules:

1. If i == 0, then it's always possible to send an empty sequence.
2. If j == 0, then it's only possible if b[0] is equal to the length of a_segment.
3. For any other case, check if it's possible to send sequence b up to index i-1 using prefix p' where p' = p + a_segment and dp[i-1][j-1] == true.

Use a dictionary to store previously computed values of (i, p) states.
