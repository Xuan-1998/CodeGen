===BEGIN PLAN===
Develop a recursive approach to determine if it's possible to send sequence $b$, given constraints on the length and value of each segment in sequence $a$.

Define the state as a tuple (i, p) where i is the current index in sequence $b$ and p is the prefix of the corresponding sequence $a$. The state can be represented by (a_length, b_index) where a_length is the length of the segment being processed in sequence $a$ and b_index is the current index in sequence $b$.

Utilize a bottom-up approach by filling the DP table from the smallest subproblems upwards, storing the results of smaller problems to solve larger ones.

For each state (i, p), calculate whether it's possible to send the remaining part of sequence $b$ starting from index i and having prefix p. If it is possible, then mark this state as True; otherwise, mark it as False.

The base case for the recurrence would be when we've processed the entire sequence $b$. In this case, return True if all values in the processed segment are equal to 1 (indicating that the segment can be split into single segments of length 1), and False otherwise.
