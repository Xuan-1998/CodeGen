===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.

state = {val: freq}
mapping each value to its frequency in sequence $a$, with the base case being when the input sequence contains all values.

transition_relationship = 
    if next_value_in_b == current_segment_length + 1:
        update segment_count by incrementing it;
    else:
        start a new segment and reset current_segment_length to 1

dynamic_programming_table = {}
where rows represent possible next values in sequence $a$
