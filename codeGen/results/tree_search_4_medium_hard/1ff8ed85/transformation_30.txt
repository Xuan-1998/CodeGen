===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.

The base case could be when n == 0 or prev_val is not present in sequence a.

State: dp[i] = True if the last i elements of sequence a can be sent over the network to get sequence b.
Transition relationship: 
dp[i] = dp[i-1] and (b[i-1] - b[i-2]) == a[j-1] for some j, where a[j-1] is the last element in sequence a that has length equal to the difference between consecutive elements of sequence b.

Use a single-dimension array to store the dynamic programming state, with the index representing the current segment and its value indicating whether the segment can be sent over the network.

For each element in sequence b, iterate through the possible values of segments in sequence a. If we find a segment that has length equal to the difference between consecutive elements of sequence b and is within bounds (i.e., not greater than n), then set dp[i] = True.

Return YES if dp[n] == True, otherwise return NO.
