===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.

Define the state expression as a tuple (n, prev_val) where n is the current length of sequence b and prev_val is the previous value in sequence b.

Transition relationship
Create a 2D table to store the dynamic programming state, where each cell dp[i][j] represents whether the first i elements of sequence b can be obtained from the first j elements of sequence a.
  * If the current element of sequence b (i.e., prev_val) is equal to the length of the current segment in sequence a (j), then we can add this element to the segment and continue processing the rest of the sequences.
  * Otherwise, we cannot process this element with the current segment and need to consider splitting the current segment or creating a new segment.

Initialization
dp[0][0] = True, as an empty sequence b can be obtained from an empty sequence a. (edge case)

Main loop
For each length n of sequence b:
  For each possible previous value prev_val in sequence b up to n:
    Initialize dp[n][prev_val] to False.
    For j from 1 to n:
      If the current element of sequence b is equal to the length of the current segment in sequence a (j), then:
        Set dp[n][prev_val] to True if it was previously set to False, indicating that we can process this element with the current segment and continue processing the rest of the sequences.
      Otherwise:
        Set dp[n][prev_val] to True only if it was previously set to False, indicating that we cannot process this element with the current segment and need to consider splitting the current segment or creating a new segment.

Answer
For each length n of sequence b:
  For each possible previous value prev_val in sequence b up to n:
    If dp[n][prev_val] is True, then print "YES" for the corresponding test case.
    Otherwise, print "NO".
