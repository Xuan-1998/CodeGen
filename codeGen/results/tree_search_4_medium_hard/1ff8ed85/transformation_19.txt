===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.

Define the state expression as a tuple (n, prev_val) where n is the current length of sequence b and prev_val is the previous value in sequence b. We'll also need to keep track of whether we've seen each number before.

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents whether the subsequence from index 0 to i in sequence b can be obtained from some subsequence of a with values up to j.

Initialize the dp array with False for all positions. Set dp[0][b_0] = True, as an empty sequence can always be matched with itself.

For each position in sequence b:
    If n is 1 or the current value in sequence b matches the previous value, then we can extend the previous subsequence by appending this segment.
    Otherwise, we cannot extend the previous subsequence and need to start a new one. This new subsequence will have its own value as the first element.

If at any point dp[i][j] is True for some i and j, it means that the first i elements of sequence b can be obtained from some subsequence of a with values up to j. We can continue this process until we've processed the entire sequence b or found a match for all its elements.
