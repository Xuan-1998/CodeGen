===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.

Define the state expression as a tuple (n, prev_val) where n is the current length of sequence b and prev_val is the previous value in sequence b.

State:
dp[(n, prev_val)] = 1 if there exists an arrangement of sequence a such that its segments are written to the left of segment lengths with values from sequence b and ending at (n, prev_val).
= 0 otherwise

Dynamic Programming Approach:
1. Initialize dp as an empty dictionary.
2. For each (n, prev_val) in the set {(1, x) | x is a value in sequence b}:
   1. If n = 1 or prev_val > max(sequence b):
      dp[(n, prev_val)] = 0
   2. Else:
      dp[(n, prev_val)] = 1 if (n-1, x) exists in dp and x < prev_val for some x in sequence b; otherwise dp[(n, prev_val)] = 0

3. Print "YES" if there exists an (n, prev_val) such that dp[(n, prev_val)] = 1; otherwise print "NO"
