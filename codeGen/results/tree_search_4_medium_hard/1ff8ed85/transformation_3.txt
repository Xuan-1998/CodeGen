===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.
Define the state expression as a tuple (n, prev_val) where n is the current length of sequence b and prev_val is the previous value in sequence b.
The transition relation will be dp[n][total] = 1 if there exists a previous total' such that total - total' is a value in sequence b and n-1 is the last segment's length, otherwise it'll be 0.
Initialize the first row of dp as [False, True, ..., False], because for the initial state (n=0), we can't split any segments to get a sequence with n elements.
Use dynamic programming with two-dimensional array tabulation to store the intermediate results.
For each element in sequence b from left to right:
    For each possible total' that could be obtained by splitting previous segments, update dp[n][total'] = 1 if there exists prev_total such that total - prev_total is a value in sequence b and n-1 is the last segment's length.
Return "YES" if for any total, dp[n][total] is True; otherwise return "NO".
