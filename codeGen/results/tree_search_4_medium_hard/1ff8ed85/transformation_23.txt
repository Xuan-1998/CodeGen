===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the sequences where the length of each segment in sequence $a$ is strictly increasing.
The base case could be when n == 0 or prev_val is not present in sequence a.
State: dp[i][j] = True if sequence b[1..i] can be obtained from sequence a[1..j].
Transition relationship: 
    for k in range(j+1):
        if (b[i] <= k) and (dp[i-1][k]):
            return True
    return False
Implement memoization using a dictionary, where memo[(i, j)] stores the result of dp[i][j] for later use.
Memoize: 
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, min(i+1, 2*n)+1):
            if (b[i-1] <= j) and not memo[(i-1, j-1)]:
                memo[(i, j)] = False
            else:
                for k in range(j+1):
                    if (b[i] <= k) and memo[(i-1, k)]:
                        memo[(i, j)] = True
                        break
                if not memo[(i, j)]:
                    return False
    return True
