===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp be a boolean array of size n+1 to store the dynamic programming states, where dp[i] represents whether number i has consecutive ones in its binary representation.

dp_base_case: Let the initial state be False (no consecutive ones) for state 0, since there are no consecutive ones in the binary representation of 0.

Transition function:
- For each i from 1 to n, check if i's binary representation has consecutive ones. 
  If it does not have consecutive ones, set dp[i] to True.
  If it has consecutive ones, set dp[i] to False.
- This transition function captures the idea that a number i either inherits the property of having consecutive ones from its predecessor (i.e., if i-1 has consecutive ones, then i also has consecutive ones) or changes its state based on its binary representation.

dp_solution: The final solution is the count of numbers from 0 to n that do not have consecutive ones in their binary representation. This can be calculated as dp[n] since we initialized the base case at state 0 and used a transition function that propagates the information forward.
