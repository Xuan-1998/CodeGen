===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[0] = 1, because there is only one number (0) that does not have consecutive ones.

Iterate over all numbers i from 1 to n:
    Initialize a flag prev_bit as 0.
    Iterate over each bit j in the binary representation of i:
        If the current bit is 1 and prev_bit was also 1, set flag to False.
        Update prev_bit to be the current bit.
    If flag is still True after the loop, increment the counter.

Return the counter as the result.
