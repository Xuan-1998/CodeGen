===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i] represent the count of numbers less than or equal to i that do not have consecutive ones in their binary representation. Initialize dp[0] to 1 because there is only one number (0) that does not contain consecutive ones.

dp_base_case: Let state i = False if a number i has consecutive ones in its binary representation, and True otherwise.
Create a list dp with size n+1 initialized with all values set to 0.
For each number from 1 to n:
    Check if the binary representation of the current number does not contain consecutive ones. If it doesn't, increment dp[i].
Return dp[n] as the final answer.
