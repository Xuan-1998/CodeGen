===BEGIN PLAN===
dp_base_case:
	* Initialize a variable dp[] with size n+1 and set all values as 0
	* Iterate over numbers less than or equal to n
		for each number i:
		* Convert i to binary representation, remove leading zeros, and store it in str[]
		* Check if consecutive ones exist in str[] by iterating over the string
			if no consecutive ones found:
				* Increment a counter variable cnt
		* Return cnt as the result
