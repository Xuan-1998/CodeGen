===BEGIN PLAN===
dp_state
Transition: dp[i] = 1 if i has no consecutive ones in its binary representation, and dp[i-1] otherwise
Initialize dp[0] = 1 (base case)
Iterate over all numbers from 1 to n:
    If the current number's binary representation does not have consecutive ones, increment the count by dp[i-1]
    Otherwise, do nothing and move on to the next number
Return the total count

dp array will keep track of whether each number has consecutive ones in its binary representation. We can use this information to efficiently count the desired numbers.
The plan is correct. To improve it, we can make the transition more explicit:
Transition: dp[i] = dp[i-1] if i has no consecutive ones in its binary representation, and 0 otherwise
This way, we only increment the count when a number does not have consecutive ones.

No potential issues with the plan.
The edge cases are handled. The base case initializes the dp array correctly. The iteration covers all numbers up to n.
