===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[0] = 1, because there is only one number (0) that does not have consecutive ones.

The state is the current number i, and the transition relationship can be formulated as:
    - if the binary representation of i does not contain consecutive ones, then dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1, 
      because we can increment the counter by 1 for each such number.
    - if the binary representation of i contains consecutive ones, then dp[i] = dp[i-1], 
      because there is no new number to add to the count.

Create a dynamic programming table dp where each index dp[i] represents the count of numbers less than or equal to i that do not have consecutive ones in their binary representation.
For i from 1 to n:
    - if the binary representation of i does not contain consecutive ones, then 
      dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1
    - else 
      dp[i] = dp[i-1]
Return dp[n]
