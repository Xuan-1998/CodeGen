===BEGIN PLAN===
dp_base_case
Let the dynamic programming states be the numbers from 0 to n, where each state represents whether a number i has consecutive ones in its binary representation. The initial state is False (no consecutive ones) for state 0.

Create a boolean array dp with size n+1, where dp[i] represents whether the number i has consecutive ones in its binary representation. Initialize dp[0] to False and fill up the rest of the dp array using iteration.

Iterate over all numbers from 0 to n:
  For each number i:
    Convert i to binary and iterate over the bits.
    If a zero is found, set dp[i] to True (no consecutive ones).
    If a one is found followed by another one in the same iteration, set dp[i] to False (consecutive ones).

Let the count be initialized to 0. Iterate again over all numbers from 0 to n:
  For each number i:
    If dp[i] is True, increment the count.

The final answer is the count.
