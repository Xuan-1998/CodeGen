dp_state
Transition: dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], 1 + (not has_consecutive_ones(i)))
Initialize: dp[0] = 0, True for consecutive ones; otherwise, start from 0
Iterate over all numbers less than or equal to n:
    For each number i, check if its binary representation contains consecutive ones:
        If not, increment the counter by 1 + dp[i-1]
    Update dp[i] with the minimum of the above value and dp[i-1]
