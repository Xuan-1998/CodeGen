===BEGIN PLAN===
Let's break down the problem and identify potential issues with the original plan.

Recognize that the problem can be solved by iterating over all numbers less than or equal to n, checking if their binary representation contains consecutive ones, and incrementing a counter for each number that does not contain consecutive ones. This approach is similar to memoization but uses iteration instead of recursion.
This part seems correct, as it correctly identifies the need to iterate over the range of numbers.

dp[0] = 1, because there is only one number (0) that does not have consecutive ones.
This base case makes sense, as indeed, the binary representation of 0 has no consecutive ones.

Consider a two-dimensional array dp where dp[i][j] is the count of numbers less than or equal to i that do not have consecutive ones in their binary representation up to j bits. The transition relation can be formulated as: dp[i+1][k+1] = sum(dp[m][l] for m in range(i) for l in range(k)) if i has no consecutive ones in its last k bits, else 0.
This part seems correct, as it correctly identifies the need to consider the binary representation of numbers up to j bits.

However, this approach might be overcomplicating things. We can simplify the problem by noticing that we only care about the count of numbers that do not have consecutive ones in their binary representation. This means we can focus on counting the numbers that do not have consecutive ones and ignore the rest.
dp[i] = dp[i-1] + sum(1 for bit in bin(i)[2:] if not (bit == '1' and i % 2 == 0))
This part seems correct, as it correctly counts the number of non-negative integers less than or equal to n that do not have consecutive ones in their binary representation.

To improve this plan, we can simplify the problem by focusing on counting the numbers that do not have consecutive ones. This reduces the complexity of the problem and makes it easier to solve.
To handle edge cases, we should ensure that our solution handles inputs where n is 0 or 1. In these cases, the count of numbers that do not have consecutive ones will be 1.
