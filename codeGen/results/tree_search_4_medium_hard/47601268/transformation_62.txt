===BEGIN PLAN===
Recognize that the problem can be solved by iterating over all numbers less than or equal to n, checking if their binary representation contains consecutive ones, and incrementing a counter for each number that does not contain consecutive ones. This approach is similar to memoization but uses iteration instead of recursion.

Let dp[i] be the count of numbers k such that 0 <= k < i and the binary representation of k + 1 does not contain consecutive ones.
dp[i] is the sum of dp[j] for j from 0 to i-1, where the binary representation of j+1 does not contain consecutive ones, and i-j-1 has no consecutive ones in its binary representation.

Let dp[0] = 1 (since there's only one number that can be represented as a single bit) and initialize an array dp with size n+1, all elements set to 0. Then, for each number from 1 to n, if the last bit is 0, then add the count of numbers less than this number that do not contain consecutive ones (which is stored in dp[i-1]) to dp[i]. If the last bit is 1 and the second last bit is 0, add dp[i-2] to dp[i]. Otherwise, set dp[i] to 0.

Finally, return dp[n].
