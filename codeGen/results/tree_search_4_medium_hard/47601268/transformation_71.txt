===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine that the problem has an optimal substructure: the number of non-negative integers less than or equal to n, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones, can be calculated by solving smaller instances of the same problem for smaller values of n. This allows you to use dynamic programming with memoization.

The state is dp[i], where dp[i] is the count of non-negative integers less than or equal to i, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones.

dp[i] represents whether the binary representation of i contains consecutive ones or not.

Use a list comprehension to create a list dp where dp[i] is the count of non-negative integers less than or equal to i, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones.

For each number j from 0 to n, if the last bit in its binary representation is 1 and it doesn't have any consecutive ones, increment dp[j+1].

Calculate the final answer by summing up all dp[i] for i from 0 to n.
