===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i] represents the count of numbers j such that 0 <= j <= i and the binary representation of j does not contain consecutive ones.

We can use a dictionary to store the results and look up values as needed. Initialize dp[0] = 1, since there is only one number (0) less than or equal to 0 with no consecutive ones in its binary representation.

For each i from 1 to n:
    - If the binary representation of i does not contain consecutive ones, increment dp[i] by dp[i-1] + 1.
    - Otherwise, set dp[i] = dp[i-1].
This approach ensures that we only consider numbers j such that 0 <= j <= i and the binary representation of j does not contain consecutive ones.

Finally, return dp[n].

This plan is correct, and it addresses edge cases by considering all possible values from 0 to n.
