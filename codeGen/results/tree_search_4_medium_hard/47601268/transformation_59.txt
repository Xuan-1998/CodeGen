===BEGIN PLAN===
dp_state:
State: dp[i] is 1 if the binary representation of i contains consecutive ones, and 0 otherwise.

Functionality:
- Initialize an array dp with n+1 elements, all set to 0.
- For each number i from 0 to n (inclusive):
    - Convert i to its binary representation and iterate over it from left to right.
    - If two consecutive bits are '1', then set dp[i] = 1; otherwise, keep it as 0.
- The answer is the sum of all values in dp array.

Edge cases:
- If n is 0, the answer will be 1 (since binary representation of 0 does not contain consecutive ones).
- If n is 1, the answer will be 2 (since binary representations of 0 and 1 do not contain consecutive ones).
