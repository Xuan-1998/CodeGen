===BEGIN PLAN===
State: dp[k] = whether k-bit numbers do not have consecutive ones
Base case: dp[0] = True (no bits -> no consecutive ones)

Dynamic Programming:
For each possible length k from 1 to log2(n):
    For each possible k-bit number num:
        If num does not have consecutive ones in its binary representation:
            dp[k] = True
        Else:
            dp[k] = False

Function: findCount(n)
    Initialize a boolean array dp[log2(n)+1] with all elements set to True (base case)
    For each possible length k from 1 to log2(n):
        For each possible k-bit number num:
            If num does not have consecutive ones in its binary representation:
                dp[k] = True
            Else:
                dp[k] = False

    Count the number of valid lengths by iterating over dp[] and summing up the boolean values
    Return the count

Edge cases: n=0 (base case), n=1 (no valid numbers), n>1 (dynamic programming works for all positive integers)
