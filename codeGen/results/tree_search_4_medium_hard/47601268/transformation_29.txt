===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i] be the count of numbers j such that 0 <= j <= i and the binary representation of j does not contain consecutive ones.

Create a dynamic programming table dp where dp[0] = 1 (base case), as the binary representation of 0 does not contain consecutive ones.

For each number i from 1 to n:
    If the binary representation of i does not contain consecutive ones, then dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1 (recursive relation).
    Else, dp[i] = dp[i-1].

Return dp[n].
