===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine that the problem has an optimal substructure: the number of non-negative integers less than or equal to n, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones, can be calculated by solving smaller instances of the same problem for smaller values of n. This allows you to use dynamic programming with memoization.

The state is dp[k][i], where k is the number of consecutive ones in the binary representation of i and i is the current integer. The base case is when k is 0.

Let state dp[k][i] be true if the binary representation of i has exactly k consecutive ones. Then transition relationship is: dp[k][i] = (dp[k-1][i//2] if k > 0 and (i % 2) == 0 else True) or dp[0][i].

Use a list to store the intermediate results and update them accordingly, with indices being the state (k, i) and values being boolean indicating whether the condition is met.

To improve this plan:

* Initialize the list with all False values for k from 1 to n and i from 0 to n.
* Update dp[k][i] based on the transition relationship when calculating the value of dp[k-1][i//2].
* Add base case: set dp[0][i] = True, since there are no consecutive ones in the binary representation of any integer.
