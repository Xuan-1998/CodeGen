===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming:
Initialize a list dp with n+1 elements and set all initial values to 0.

Let dp[i] be the count of numbers j such that 0 <= j <= i and the binary representation of j does not contain consecutive ones.
Base case: For any i, if the binary representation of i does not contain consecutive ones, then dp[i] = i + 1 (because all numbers less than or equal to i do not have consecutive ones in their binary representation).
Inductive step:
For each i, consider the binary representation bi of i. If it contains consecutive ones, then dp[i] = dp[j - 1], where j is the number such that bi of j does not contain consecutive ones and j < i.
If bi does not contain consecutive ones, then dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1 (because all numbers less than or equal to i do not have consecutive ones in their binary representation).

Iterate from 0 to n and update the value of dp[i] accordingly.
