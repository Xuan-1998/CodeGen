===BEGIN PLAN===
dp_state = [0] * (n + 1)
Transition: dp[i] = dp[i - 1] if i == 0 else (dp[i - 1] or not has_consecutive_ones(i))
Initialize dp[0] to 1
Iterate over numbers from 1 to n
For each number i, check its binary representation using a helper function has_consecutive_ones(i)
If the binary representation does not contain consecutive ones, increment dp[i]
Return dp[n]
