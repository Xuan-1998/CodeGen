===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[0] = 1
For i from 1 to n:
    if the binary representation of i does not contain consecutive ones:
        dp[i] = 2*dp[i-1]
    else:
        dp[i] = dp[i-1]
Return dp[n]
Handle edge cases: If n is 0, return 1 (since there's only one number that doesn't have consecutive ones). If n is 1, return 2 (since 0 and 1 don't have consecutive ones).
Consider using a more efficient way to check if the binary representation of i contains consecutive ones. For example, you could iterate over the bits from left to right, keeping track of the previous bit, and only update dp[i] when the current bit is different from the previous one.
