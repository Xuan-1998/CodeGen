dp_state = {}
Transition: dp[i] = (dp[i-1] and not has_consecutive_ones(i)) or 1
Initialize dp[0] = 1, since there is only one number with no consecutive ones for n = 0
Implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by iterating over all numbers from 1 to n:
    For each number i:
        Check if its binary representation contains consecutive ones
        If not, update dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1
        Otherwise, update dp[i] = dp[i-1]
Return dp[n]
