===BEGIN PLAN===
dp_base_case
Consider a two-state machine with states 'no-consecutive-ones' and 'found-consecutive-ones', where transitions occur based on whether the current bit is 0 or 1. Count the number of times the state 'no-consecutive-ones' occurs before reaching n.

Let's iterate over all numbers from 0 to n, and for each number, check if it contains consecutive ones in its binary representation.
Initialize a counter variable and increment it whenever we find a number that does not contain consecutive ones. This way, we can count the total number of such numbers.
The state machine will help us decide whether or not to increment the counter based on the current bit.

When iterating over all numbers from 0 to n, check if each number's binary representation contains consecutive ones. If it doesn't, then increment the counter. Keep track of the total count at each step and return this value as the final answer.
