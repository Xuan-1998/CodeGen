===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that the number of non-negative integers less than or equal to n, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones, can be calculated by counting the number of such integers for each possible length from 0 to log2(n), and then summing these counts. This allows you to use dynamic programming with tabulation.

The state is a boolean value indicating whether the current number of bits is valid (i.e., does not have consecutive ones) and the base case is when k = 0.
'State': a boolean value indicating whether the current number of bits is valid (i.e., does not have consecutive ones) and the base case is when k = 0, for a given length k.

Initialize an integer variable to keep track of the count.
Use a loop to iterate over the possible lengths from 0 to log2(n).
For each length k:
    Initialize a boolean array dp with size (1 << k) + 1. The base case is when the number of bits is 0, which means the binary representation is valid.
    For each bit position i from 0 to k-1:
        Calculate whether the current binary representation is valid given that the previous i bits are valid and do not contain consecutive ones.
        If the current binary representation is valid, set dp[i+1] to True; otherwise, set it to False.
    Calculate the count of non-negative integers with a valid binary representation up to length k by summing over all 0s and 1s in the array.
Add the count to the total count.

The final answer is the total count after iterating over all lengths from 0 to log2(n).
