State: dp[i] represents whether the binary representation of i contains consecutive ones.

1. Define a function that takes an integer num and returns whether its binary representation contains consecutive ones.
2. Initialize a counter, count, set it to 0.
3. Iterate over all numbers from 0 to n:
    - Calculate the binary representation of the current number.
    - Check if the binary representation contains consecutive ones using the function defined in step 1.
    - If it does not contain consecutive ones, increment the counter.
4. Return the count.

This plan is correct and can be implemented using dynamic programming. However, there are some edge cases that need to be handled:
- The function defined in step 1 should handle single-digit numbers correctly (since they cannot have consecutive ones).
- Edge case: If n is less than or equal to 0, return 0.
