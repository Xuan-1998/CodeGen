===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine that the problem has an optimal substructure: the number of non-negative integers less than or equal to n, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones, can be calculated by solving smaller instances of the same problem for smaller values of n. This allows you to use dynamic programming with memoization.

The state is dp[i], where dp[i] is the count of non-negative integers less than or equal to i, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones.
Determine a transition function: if the last bit in the binary representation of i (i.e., i % 2) is 0, then there are two possibilities for the previous bits: either all zeros or one followed by zeros. If the last bit is 1, then there are three possibilities: zero, one followed by zeros, or consecutive ones.
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to initialize dp array and calculate dp[i] based on smaller instances of the same problem.

The base case for the transition function is when i is 0, where the answer is 2 (all zeros and one).
