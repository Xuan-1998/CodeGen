===BEGIN PLAN===
Create a boolean array dp with size n+1 where dp[i] represents whether the binary representation of i contains consecutive ones.
State: dp[0] = 0 (base case)
For each integer i from 1 to n:
    If the most significant bit in the binary representation of i is 0, then check if the rest of the bits represent a number that does not contain consecutive ones. 
    If they do, set dp[i] = 0; otherwise, set dp[i] = 1.
Return the count of integers less than or equal to n where dp[i] = 0.
