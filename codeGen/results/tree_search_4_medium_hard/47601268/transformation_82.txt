Determine that the problem has an optimal substructure: the number of non-negative integers less than or equal to n, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones, can be calculated by solving smaller instances of the same problem for smaller values of n. This allows you to use dynamic programming with memoization.

The state is dp[k][i], where k is the number of consecutive ones in the binary representation of i and i is the current integer. The base case is when k is 0.
Let state dp[k][i] be true if the binary representation of i has exactly k consecutive ones. Then transition relationship is: dp[k][i] = (dp[k-1][i//2] if k > 0 and (i % 2) == 0 else True) or dp[0][i].

Create a 2D list dp of size (n+1) x (log(n)+1), where dp[i][j] represents whether the binary representation of i has exactly j consecutive ones. Initialize the base case as True for all i and k, then update dp[k][i] based on the transition relationship.

Fill in the base case by initializing dp[0][i] to True for all i.

For each i from 1 to n:
    For each k from 0 to log(n):
        Calculate dp[k][i] using the transition relationship and update it.
