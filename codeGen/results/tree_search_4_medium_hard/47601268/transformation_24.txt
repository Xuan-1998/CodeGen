===BEGIN PLAN===
dp_state
Consider two states: (0, 1) where 0 means the last bit is 0 and 1 means it's 1, and dp_state is whether the current number does not contain consecutive ones.
Initialize a list to represent the dynamic programming state for each number up to n

For i from 0 to n:
    Initialize dp[i] = 1 (the base case)
    For j from 0 to i-1:
        If the binary representation of i-j contains consecutive ones and dp[j] == 1, then set dp[i] = 0
    Increment count if dp[i] == 1
