===BEGIN PLAN===
Recognize that the problem can be solved by iterating over all numbers less than or equal to n, and for each number i, checking if its binary representation contains consecutive ones. The dynamic programming state is then True (contains consecutive ones) or False (does not contain consecutive ones).
dp_base_case
Let dp[i] be a boolean indicating whether the number i has consecutive ones in its binary representation.
Initialize dp with default value as False for all states, and fill it up accordingly.

for i from 0 to n:
    if i == 0:
        dp[i] = False
    else:
        prev_bit = (i >> (log2(i) - 1)) & 1
        cur_bit = i % 2
        if prev_bit != cur_bit and not ((prev_bit == 0 and cur_bit == 1) or (prev_bit == 1 and cur_bit == 0)):
            dp[i] = False
        else:
            dp[i] = True

count = sum(1 for i in range(n+1) if not dp[i])
