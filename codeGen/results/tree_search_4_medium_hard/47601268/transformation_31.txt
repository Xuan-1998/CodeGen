Let dp[i] be the count of numbers j such that 0 <= j <= i and the binary representation of j does not contain consecutive ones.

The original plan is correct in recognizing the problem as one that can be solved by dynamic programming. The main idea is to iterate over all numbers less than or equal to n, checking if their binary representation contains consecutive ones, and incrementing a counter for each number that does not contain consecutive ones.

Here's how you could improve it:

Initialize a dictionary memo where memo[i] is initially set to None for each i from 0 to n. Then update memo[i] based on whether the binary representation of i does not contain consecutive ones.

Iterate over all numbers less than or equal to n, using memo to determine which numbers do not have consecutive ones in their binary representation. For each number i, check if its binary representation contains a sequence of consecutive 1s. If it does not, increment dp[i].

Finally, return dp[n] as the count of non-negative integers less than or equal to n that do not contain consecutive ones in their binary representation.

The plan includes edge cases by initializing memo with None for each i from 0 to n.
