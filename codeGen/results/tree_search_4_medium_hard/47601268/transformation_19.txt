===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[0] = 1, because there is only one number (0) that does not have consecutive ones.

Consider a number k as a sequence of bits '0' and '1'. Define dp[i] as the number of non-negative integers j less than or equal to i that do not have consecutive ones in their binary representation. The transition relationship can be formulated as:
if the binary representation of i does not contain consecutive ones, then dp[i] = 2*dp[i-1], because we can double the count for each such number.
If the binary representation of i contains consecutive ones, then dp[i] = dp[i-1], because there is no new number to add to the count.

Create a dynamic programming table (dp) where each index represents the count of non-negative integers less than or equal to that index, without consecutive ones in their binary representation. Initialize the first element as 1 and iterate over the range [1, n] to fill up the dp array.

for i from 1 to n:
    if the binary representation of i does not contain consecutive ones:
        dp[i] = 2*dp[i-1]
    else:
        dp[i] = dp[i-1]

Return dp[n] as the final answer.
