===BEGIN PLAN===
Recognize that the problem can be solved by iterating over all numbers less than or equal to n, checking if their binary representation contains consecutive ones, and incrementing a counter for each number that does not contain consecutive ones.

dp_base_case
Consider a two-state machine with states 'no-consecutive-ones' and 'found-consecutive-ones', where transitions occur based on whether the current bit is 0 or 1. Count the number of times the state 'no-consecutive-ones' occurs before reaching n.

Use a boolean array to store whether each number less than or equal to n has consecutive ones in its binary representation, and then use this array to count the numbers that do not have consecutive ones.

Initialize a counter for the total count.
Iterate from 0 to n (inclusive), for each number:
    Convert the number to binary and iterate over its digits.
    Initialize a variable 'no-consecutive-ones' as true.
    Iterate over the digits, if you find a sequence of consecutive ones, set 'no-consecutive-ones' to false.
    If 'no-consecutive-ones' is still true after the iteration, increment the counter.
Return the counter.
