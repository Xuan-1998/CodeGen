===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[0] = 1, because there is only one number (0) that does not have consecutive ones.

The state is the current number i, and the transition relationship can be formulated as:
    if the binary representation of i does not contain consecutive ones,
        then dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1, because we can increment the counter by 1 for each such number.
    else
        then dp[i] = dp[i-1], because there is no new number to add to the count.

Maintain a set to keep track of numbers that do not contain consecutive ones,
and use this set to calculate the final result.

Initialize dp array with size n+1 and all values as 0.
Fill up the dp array by iterating from i = 1 to n:
    for each i, check if its binary representation contains consecutive ones or not
    if it does not contain consecutive ones, then update dp[i] as dp[i-1] + 1
    else, keep dp[i] same as dp[i-1]

Return the final value of dp[n]
