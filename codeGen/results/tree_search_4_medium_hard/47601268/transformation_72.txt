===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine that the problem has an optimal substructure: the number of non-negative integers less than or equal to n, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones, can be calculated by solving smaller instances of the same problem for smaller values of n. This allows you to use dynamic programming with memoization.

The state is dp[i], where dp[i] is the count of non-negative integers less than or equal to i, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones.
The transition relationship could be dp[i] = (i % 2 == 0) + dp[i-1], as it only depends on the previous state.

However, this plan has a major issue: it does not consider the actual binary representation of the numbers. The problem statement explicitly mentions that it's about the binary representations of the numbers.

To fix this, we can use a different approach: instead of directly calculating dp[i], we calculate the count of non-negative integers less than or equal to i whose binary representation does NOT contain consecutive ones by considering all possible last bits (0 or 1) and recursively counting the numbers that satisfy the condition for each case.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
