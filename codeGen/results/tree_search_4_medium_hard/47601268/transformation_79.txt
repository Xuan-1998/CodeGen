===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine that the problem has an optimal substructure: the number of non-negative integers less than or equal to n, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones, can be calculated by solving smaller instances of the same problem for smaller values of n. This allows you to use dynamic programming with memoization.

The state is dp[i], where i is the current integer. The base case is when i is 0.
dp[i] represents whether the binary representation of i contains consecutive ones. If it does, then there is no such number less than or equal to i whose binary representation does not contain consecutive ones. If it doesn't, then dp[j] = False for all j where j < i.

To calculate dp[i], you can iterate over all numbers from 0 to i-1 and check if their binary representations do not contain consecutive ones. For each number j, calculate its binary representation as a string, and count the number of times '11' appears in it. If this count is greater than 1, then the binary representation of j contains consecutive ones. If not, then you can recursively calculate dp[j] using memoization.

Finally, use a dictionary to store the memoized values, where dp[i] represents whether the binary representation of i contains consecutive ones.

The function to solve the problem would be:
def count_numbers(n):
    dp = {0: False}
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if '1' * i.count('11') > 0:
            dp[i] = True
        else:
            dp[i] = False
    return sum(1 - int(value) for value in dp.values())
