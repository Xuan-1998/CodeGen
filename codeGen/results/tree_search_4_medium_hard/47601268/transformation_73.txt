===BEGIN PLAN===
Determine that the problem has an optimal substructure: the number of non-negative integers less than or equal to n, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones, can be calculated by solving smaller instances of the same problem for smaller values of n. This allows you to use dynamic programming with memoization.

The state is dp[i], where dp[i] is the count of non-negative integers less than or equal to i, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones.
The transition relationship could be dp[i] = sum(dp[j]) for j in range(i-1), as it depends on all previous states. However, this would result in an exponential time complexity.

To improve the plan, consider using a more efficient data structure to store the computed values of dp[i]. A binary indexed tree (BIT) could be used to efficiently calculate prefix sums and update the dp array.

The transition relationship should also take into account whether the last bit of i is 0 or 1. If it's 0, then the count remains the same as the previous state. If it's 1, then the count depends on whether the number of consecutive ones in the binary representation of i-1 is odd or even.

Implement memoization using a dictionary to store the computed values of dp[i], and update it recursively by considering the possible previous states.
Handle edge cases: what if n is 0? In this case, return 1 as there is only one number that meets the condition (which is 0 itself).
