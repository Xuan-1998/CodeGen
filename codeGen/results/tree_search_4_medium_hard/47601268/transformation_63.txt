Let dp[i] be the count of numbers k such that 0 <= k < i and the binary representation of k does not contain consecutive ones.
dp[0] = 1
For i from 1 to n:
    Let cnt = 0
    For j from i-1 down to 0:
        If the binary representation of j does not have consecutive ones, then add dp[j] to cnt
    dp[i] = cnt + (1 if the binary representation of i has no consecutive ones else 0)
Let ans be the sum of dp[i] for i from 0 to n
Return ans
