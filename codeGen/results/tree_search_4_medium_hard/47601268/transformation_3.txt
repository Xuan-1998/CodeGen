===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with tabulation.
The state is a boolean value indicating whether the current number of bits is valid (i.e., does not have consecutive ones) and the base case is when k = 0.
We will use a boolean array dp where dp[i] represents whether i-th binary number does not contain consecutive ones.

Let's define the state transition:
dp[k][0] means the last bit in the binary representation of the current integer is 0, so we don't have to worry about the next bit being 1.
dp[k][1] means the last bit in the binary representation of the current integer is 1, so we have to check if the next bit can be added without having consecutive ones.

We initialize dp[0][0] = True because an empty string has no consecutive ones.

The state transition function should look like this:

dp[k][0] = (dp[k-1][0] || !dp[k-1][1]) && (!dp[k-1][0] || dp[k-1][1])
dp[k][1] = (dp[k-1][0] || dp[k-1][1]) && (!dp[k-1][0] || !dp[k-1][1])

This function ensures that the last bit is either 0 or 1 and does not have consecutive ones.

The base case is when k = 0. In this case, we just need to consider whether the number of bits is even or odd because a single 0 or 1 cannot have consecutive ones.
dp[0][0] = True
dp[0][1] = True

Finally, we calculate the total count of numbers without consecutive ones in their binary representation by summing dp[k][0] and dp[k][1] for k from 0 to log2(n).
