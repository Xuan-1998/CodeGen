===BEGIN PLAN===
dp_base_case
Let the dynamic programming states be the numbers from 0 to n, where each state represents whether a number i has consecutive ones in its binary representation. The initial state is True (consecutive ones) for state 0 and False (no consecutive ones) for all other states.
The transition function can be defined as follows:
- If a number i's binary representation does not contain consecutive ones, then the next number i+1 will also not have consecutive ones if its most significant bit is different from i's most significant bit.
- If a number i's binary representation contains consecutive ones, then the next number i+1 will always contain consecutive ones.

This plan can be improved by using a one-dimensional array instead of a two-dimensional array for the dynamic programming states. This is because the problem only requires considering the presence or absence of consecutive ones in a number's binary representation, not the actual bits themselves.
The potential issue with this plan is that it does not handle edge cases correctly. For instance, what if n is 0? The initial state should be set to False instead of True.

Here is the updated version:
