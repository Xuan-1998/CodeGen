===BEGIN PLAN===
Recognize that the problem can be solved by iterating over all numbers less than or equal to n, checking if their binary representation contains consecutive ones, and incrementing a counter for each number that does not contain consecutive ones.

dp_base_case
Define the transition function as follows: dp[i] = 1 - (binary representation of i contains consecutive ones), where dp[i-1] represents whether the binary representation of i-1 contains consecutive ones.
Use dynamic programming to build an array where each element at index i represents whether the binary representation of the number i contains consecutive ones.

For i from 0 to n:
    If the binary representation of i does not contain consecutive ones, then dp[i] = 1 and increment a counter;
    Otherwise, dp[i] = 0 and do nothing.
Return the counter as the answer.
