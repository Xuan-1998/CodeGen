===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[0] = 1, because there is only one number (0) that does not have consecutive ones.

Let dp[i] be the count of numbers less than or equal to i that do not have consecutive ones. The transition relation can be formulated as:
dp[i+1] = sum(dp[j] for j in range(i)) if i has no consecutive ones, else 1.
Because when i has no consecutive ones, all numbers less than or equal to i+1 also have no consecutive ones, so the count is the same as the previous number.

Dynamically create a list of numbers less than or equal to n, then iterate over this list to count numbers without consecutive ones. Initialize dp with 0s and set dp[0] = 1.
