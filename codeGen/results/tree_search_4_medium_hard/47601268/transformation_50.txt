===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[0] = 1
Recognize that dp[i] can be computed using information from dp[j] where j < i and the binary representation of i has no consecutive ones at its last log2(i) bits.

Initialize a variable count as 1, representing the number of integers less than or equal to n that do not have consecutive ones in their binary representation. 
Then iterate over all numbers m from 0 to n.
For each m, calculate the length k of the binary representation of m.
If the binary representation of m does not contain consecutive ones at its last log2(k) bits, then update count by adding dp[k-1].
Finally, return count.

dp[i] = 1 if i has no consecutive ones in its binary representation else sum(dp[m][l] for m in range(i) for l in range(log2(i)))
