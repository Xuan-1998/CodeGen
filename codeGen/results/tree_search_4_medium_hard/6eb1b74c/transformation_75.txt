===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using top-down dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Represent the state as (i, n) where i is the current index in the text t and n is the number of strings left to use. This allows us to keep track of the position in the text and the remaining strings to be used.

Implement memoization by creating a recursive function that uses a dictionary to store and reuse previously computed values for the same state. The dictionary will map states to their corresponding values, which are the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters t in red up to the given index i using n strings.

To avoid infinite recursion, set a base case where if there are no more strings left or we've reached the end of the text, return 0 as the minimum number of steps. If not all characters have been colored (i.e., i < len(t)), recursively call the function with the next index and decrement n by 1.

To determine if it's possible to color all letters t in red, check if there are any strings left to use and if we haven't reached the end of the text. If both conditions are met, return -1 as it's impossible to color all characters.

The memoized function will keep track of the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters t in red up to each index i using n strings. This allows us to avoid redundant calculations and efficiently solve the problem.
