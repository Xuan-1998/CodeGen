Plan:
===BEGIN PLAN===
Use top-down dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Create a dictionary dp where key is a tuple (text, start_index) and value is the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text red starting from the given index.
Initialize dp with default value -1 for any input that cannot be processed.

Define a recursive function solve(text, start_index):
    If the entire text is colored red, return 0 as no more steps are needed.
    Initialize min_steps = float('inf') and best_strings = []
    
    For each string in the set:
        Find the longest substring of the current string that can be colored red from the given start index using memoization (i.e., dp[substring, 0]).
        If the length of the found substring is greater than 0:
            Calculate the new start_index as the end index of the found substring.
            Recursively call solve on the remaining part of the text with the calculated start_index.
            Add the string and its corresponding steps to min_steps and best_strings if the calculated steps are less than min_steps.

    If no strings can color any letters in the text red, return -1.
    Return min_steps + 1 as the minimum number of steps required.

Use memoization by storing the results of solve(text, start_index) in dp for further reuse.

Print the result and a sequence of string indices that represent the optimal coloring process.
