===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using top-down dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state as a tuple (position, strings) where position is the current position in the text and strings is the set of unused strings. Formulate transition relationships based on whether there are any occurrences of any string in the given strings at the current position or not.

Create a dictionary to store the memoized values with keys as tuples (position, strings) and values as the minimum number of steps required to color all letters up to that position.

If there is no occurrence of any string at the current position, transition to the next position by removing one unused string from the set of unused strings. If there are occurrences of some strings at the current position, for each string in the given strings that matches an occurrence, find the minimum number of steps required to color all letters up to that position with the remaining strings and add 1 to it.

Start with a base case where the position is out of range or there are no unused strings left. In this case, return -1 if there are any unused strings left because they cannot be used to color the text, otherwise return the number of steps required to color all letters up to that position.

Use dynamic programming to fill in the memoized values starting from the base case and going backwards until we reach the initial state. The minimum number of steps required to color all letters up to any position is the value stored at that position in the dictionary.

Finally, return the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text by finding the value stored at the end position in the dictionary.
