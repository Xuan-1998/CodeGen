===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using bottom-up dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Determine if the state should be represented as (i, j) where i is the current index in the text t and j is the current string being considered for coloring. This approach would allow us to keep track of which strings have been used and what's left to color.

Create a memoization dictionary that maps state tuples (i, s) to the minimum steps required to color all letters in t up to index i using the current string s or any previously used strings.

To further optimize this approach, we can consider keeping an additional data structure to keep track of the indices where each string was last seen. This would allow us to quickly determine which strings are available for coloring at a given point in time.

This plan includes edge cases such as handling the case where it's impossible to color all letters in t (i.e., there are no strings left that can be used to color any remaining letters).
