===BEGIN PLAN===
Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] will store the minimum number of steps needed to color all characters in t up to position j using the strings s_1, ..., s_n. 
Initialize dp with n+1 rows and |t|+1 columns.
Iterate over each character c in t from left to right:
	For each string s_i:
		If s_i ends at or before position i:
			Update dp[i][i] = 0 (no need to use the string)
		else: 
			Update dp[i][j] by considering all strings that end after position j
		Return min(dp[|t|-1][|t|-1]) as the minimum number of steps needed
===END PLAN===
