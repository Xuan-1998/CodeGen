===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using top-down dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Consider defining the state as a tuple of (text index, remaining substrings) and formulate the transition relationship based on whether the current character in the text matches any of the remaining substrings. This can help identify the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters of the text t in red.

Use a dictionary to store the memoized results of the recursive function, with keys being the states and values being the corresponding results.

To avoid infinite recursion, define a base case where there are no more remaining substrings. In this case, return 0 as the minimum number of steps needed.

Consider using a priority queue or heap to keep track of the substrings that can be used next, prioritizing the ones with the most matching characters in the text t. This can help reduce the number of recursive calls and improve performance.

Update the state accordingly based on whether the current character matches any of the remaining substrings. If it does, increment the minimum number of steps needed by 1 and update the remaining substrings by removing the matched substring from the list.

Use a set to keep track of the covered characters in the text t. Update this set accordingly based on the matched substrings.

Return the minimum number of steps needed as the result.
