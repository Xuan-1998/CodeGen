===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about applying top-down dynamic programming by initializing a 1D array for the maximum number of steps and iteratively updating it based on the prefix and used strings.

The state is a 2D array where each cell stores the maximum number of steps needed to color all letters in the text from the current position to the end, given the used strings until that point.

State: dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in text[:i+1] (from start to j) given used strings until i. Transition relationship: if any string s_k is a substring of text[i:i+len(s_k)], use it and decrement the step count, else keep the same.

Initialize a 2D array where each cell stores the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in the text from the current position to the end, given the used strings until that point.

Iterate over the text and update dp[i][j] based on whether any string s_k is a substring of text[i:i+len(s_k)]. If it is, use it and decrement the step count. Then, find the minimum number of steps for all letters from start to i-1.

Finally, return dp[0][len(text)-1]. If this value equals -1, print -1; otherwise, output m which is the minimum number of steps needed to turn all letters t red. Then in the next m lines, print pairs of indices: w_j and p_j (1 <= j <= m), which denote that the string with index w_j was used as a substring to cover occurrences starting from position p_j in the text t.
