===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Use a priority queue where each node represents a substring of the text and its corresponding minimum number of steps. Use this priority queue to build up the solution in a bottom-up manner.

Create a priority queue (heap) and initialize it with all substrings of length 1 from the given text t, along with their corresponding colors (all uncolored initially).

Sort the priority queue based on the positions of these substrings in the original text. This ensures that longer substrings are processed before shorter ones.

For each substring in the priority queue:

    Extract and process the longest possible substring (with no overlapping occurrences) from the given text t, while ensuring all letters are colored red.
    
    For this extracted substring:
        Find the minimum number of steps needed to color it red by trying to use different strings si from the set as many times as possible.
        
        Store the result in a memoization dictionary.

    Push the processed substring back into the priority queue along with its corresponding minimum number of steps, ensuring that longer substrings are processed before shorter ones.

Continue this process until the priority queue is empty. The final answer will be the total number of steps required to color all letters of the text t red.
    
    If it's impossible to color all letters in red, return -1.
