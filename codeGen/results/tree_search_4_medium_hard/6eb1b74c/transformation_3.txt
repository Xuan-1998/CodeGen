===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming with memoization by creating a 3D array dp with dimensions (|t| + 1) x n x m, where dp[i][j][k] represents the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text given a prefix of length i and using the strings s_1, ..., s_k.
Create dp[0][i][j] as -1 for all i, j because it is impossible to color any letters without using any strings.

For each character t[i] (1 <= i <= |t|), iterate over the strings s_1, ..., s_n. For each string s_j:
    If the string s_j occurs in the prefix t[0..i], update dp[i+1][j][k] as min(dp[i+1][j][k], dp[i][j-1][k] + 1) where k is the index of the used string.
    Otherwise, update dp[i+1][j][k] as dp[i][j][k].

Once the dynamic programming table is filled, backtrack from the bottom-right corner to find the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text. For each step, print the index of the used string and its position in the text.

The plan includes edge cases where no strings can be used (i.e., dp[|t|][i][j] = -1 for some i, j) or where all strings need to be used (i.e., dp[|t|][0][n-1]).
