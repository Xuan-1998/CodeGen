===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about applying bottom-up dynamic programming by initializing a 2D array dp for the minimum number of steps and iteratively updating it based on the prefix and used strings.

The state represents the minimum number of steps to color all letters in the text up to a given position, considering the used strings so far. 
Consider state as (i, s), where i is the current position in the text and s is the last used string. The transition relationship can be defined as: if the substring from i to i+|s| matches the string s, then update the minimum number of steps to coloring all letters up to i by considering the next position; otherwise, keep the minimum number of steps the same.

Create a 2D array dp of size (|t| + 1) x n and initialize each element as -1. 
For each substring of t from i to |t|, calculate the minimum number of steps by considering all possible last used strings s in S and updating the state accordingly.
For each string s in S:
    Initialize a temporary array temp of size (|t| + 1) with the same initial value as dp.
    Iterate over all positions j from i to |t|, for each position j:
        If the substring from j to j+|s| matches the string s, update the minimum number of steps in temp by considering the next position; otherwise, keep the minimum number of steps the same.
    Update the dp array at position (j, k) as min(dp(j-1, k), temp(j, k)) for all possible last used strings s in S and j from i to |t|.
If it is impossible to color all letters of the text t in red, output -1. 
Otherwise, on the first line, print the number m which is the minimum number of steps it will take to turn all the letters t red.
Then in the next m lines, print pairs of indices: w_j and p_j (1 <= j <= m), which denote that the string with index w_j was used as a substring to cover the occurrences starting in the text t from position p_j. The pairs can be output in any order.
