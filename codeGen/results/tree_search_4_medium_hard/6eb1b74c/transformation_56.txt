===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using top-down dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Represent the state as the current position in the text and the set of available substrings to use. The transition relation could be defined as the new set of available substrings after applying a given substring at the current position.

Implement tabulation using a 2D array where each row represents a position in the text and each column represents the set of available substrings at that position. The cell at position i and set S would store the minimum number of steps required to color all letters up to position i using only substrings from S.

To improve the plan, consider implementing a priority queue to keep track of the most promising positions in the text for each available substring. This can help reduce the time complexity by focusing on the most efficient use of available substrings.

The plan includes edge cases: it handles the case where it is impossible to color all letters in the text (in which case the output would be -1), as well as the base case where the entire text has already been colored.
