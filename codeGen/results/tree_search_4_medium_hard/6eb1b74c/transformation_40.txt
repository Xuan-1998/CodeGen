===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using top-down dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Use memoization within the recursive function to store and reuse previously computed results.

Define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all characters in the first i characters of t if we have already colored the first j characters. Initialize dp[0][0] as 0.

Create a recursive function that takes three parameters: i, j, and memo, where memo is a dictionary used for memoization. If the result is already stored in memo, return the result directly. Otherwise:

- If all characters in the first i characters of t have been colored (i.e., j = |t|), then dp[i][j] should be 1.

- Otherwise, initialize dp[i][j] as infinity and try to color each character in the first i characters of t by considering the following two cases:

    * If the current character is not contained in any string si (1 ≤ i ≤ n), then we don't need to color this character.
    * Otherwise, consider all possible strings that contain this character. For each string si, try to color the occurrences of this string in the first i characters of t starting from position j. If it's possible to color all occurrences of this string, then increment dp[i][j] by 1 and recursively call the function with updated values.

- Finally, update memo with the computed result dp[i][j] and return it.

Use a loop to fill up the dp array in row-major order (i.e., i increases first). For each cell dp[i][j], calculate its value using the recursive function and store it in memo.

Print the minimum number of steps needed to color all characters in t, which is stored in dp[|t|][|t|]. If it's impossible to color all characters in t, print -1.
