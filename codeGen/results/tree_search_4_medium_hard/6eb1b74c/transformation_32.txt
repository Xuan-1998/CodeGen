===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about applying bottom-up dynamic programming by initializing a 2D array dp for the minimum number of steps and iteratively updating it based on the prefix and used strings.
A state represents the last string used, its corresponding last covered position, and whether a substring is fully covered; the base case is when no string has been used (last string used: None, last covered position: 0, fully covered: False).
The transition relationship is defined as:
    - If any string in the set appears at or after i-1, update dp[i] = min(dp[i-1][k]) + 1 where k is the index of the string that ends at or before i-1 and covers characters up to position i; otherwise, set dp[i] to the minimum number of steps needed to cover all occurrences of strings in the set ending at position i.
    - Update fully covered to True if all characters up to position i are covered; otherwise, False.
Initialize dp with values from (None, 0, False) to (last string used: None, last covered position: |t|-1, fully covered: True), representing the base case where no string has been used.
