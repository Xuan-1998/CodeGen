===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using bottom-up tabulation to create a 2D array where the state at each position represents the minimum number of steps required to color all letters up to that point.

Create a 2D array dp with dimensions (|t| + 1) x n, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the first i characters of t using only the first j strings s_1, s_2, ..., s_j.

Fill in the base case: for i = 0, dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since we don't need any steps to color an empty text.

For each position i in the text and each string s_j:

    If the string s_j appears at the current position i in the text:
        Update dp[i][j] with the minimum of its current value and dp[i - |s_j|][j] + 1. This represents the minimum number of steps required to color all letters up to this point, considering the use of string s_j.

    Otherwise, keep the current value of dp[i][j].

Return dp[|t|][n], which represents the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the entire text using the given strings.

For each step k in the minimum number of steps:
    Print the index w_k and position p_k such that string s_w_k was used as a substring to cover occurrences starting at position p_k.
