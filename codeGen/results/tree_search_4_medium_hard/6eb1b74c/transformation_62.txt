===BEGIN PLAN===
Use top-down dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

\
View each string as a 'token' that can be used to change the state (number of red characters) from one step to another. Formulate the state and transition relationships by considering how many tokens can be used in each step to change the state.

Create a dynamic programming table (DP table) to store the minimum number of steps required to color each prefix of the text, where each cell in the DP table represents the minimum number of steps needed to color the corresponding prefix.

Maintain an additional array dp_to_prev_states to keep track of which tokens were used to get from one state to another. This will be useful for backtracking and generating the optimal sequence of tokens.

In the recursive function, use memoization to store the results of subproblems in a dictionary called memo.

Use a base case to handle the empty string (or an edge case), and then use recursion to break down the problem into smaller subproblems.

For each recursive call, update the DP table with the minimum number of steps needed to color the current prefix. If it's impossible to color all characters in red, return -1.

When backtracking, use dp_to_prev_states to determine which tokens were used to get from one state to another and print the optimal sequence of tokens.
