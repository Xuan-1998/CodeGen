===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using bottom-up dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating an iterative function that uses a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] will represent the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in the substring t[:i+1] ending at index j using the strings s_1, s_2, ..., s_n.

Base cases:
- For empty string or no strings left, return 0 as it takes no steps to color an empty string.
- If there's a mismatch between the current character in t and any of the strings s_i, then we increment the step count for that substring and recursively call dp on the remaining part of t.

Memoization:
- Store the results of subproblems in a dictionary memo, using tuple(i, j) as the key.
- Before computing dp[i][j], check if it's already computed and store its result if so.

Optimization:
- For each cell dp[i][j], we can avoid recalculating the same step count by looking at the previous characters of t that have been processed. This is because once a character in t has been colored red, it won't be changed again.
