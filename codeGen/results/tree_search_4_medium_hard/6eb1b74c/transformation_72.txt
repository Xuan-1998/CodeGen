===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using top-down dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Represent the state as a pair (s_i, p) where s_i is a string from the set S and p is its starting position in the text t. This could help to avoid redundant calculations by only considering substrings that can be covered using the remaining strings.

Define a recursive function dp(s_i, p) that returns the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in red up to the current point p using string s_i as a substring. The base case for this recursion is when p is equal to the length of t (i.e., we have reached the end of the text).

Update the memoization table by iterating through the strings and their starting positions, and fill the table with the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in red up to that point.

To improve this plan, consider using a bottom-up tabulation approach instead of top-down dynamic programming. This could help to avoid redundant calculations and make the solution more efficient.

One potential issue with the plan is that it does not handle edge cases. For example, what if the text t contains no occurrences of any strings from the set S? In this case, the function should return -1.

To handle edge cases, consider adding additional conditions to the recursive function dp(s_i, p) to check for these special cases.

Here is the updated version of the plan:
