===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using bottom-up dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Consider the state as a tuple (i, j) where i is the current position in the text t and j is the number of strings used so far, with base cases when i reaches the end of the text or j exceeds the maximum allowed.

Use dynamic programming with memoization to create a function that takes as input the current position i in the text t and the number of strings j used so far, and returns the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters up to position i using at most j strings. 

Create an array dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters up to position i using at most j strings.

For each string s in the set S:
  For each occurrence of s in the text t from position 0 to i:
    Calculate the minimum number of steps needed to color the remaining part of the text after coloring the current occurrence.
    Update dp[i][j] if necessary.

Return dp[|t|-1][n-1].
