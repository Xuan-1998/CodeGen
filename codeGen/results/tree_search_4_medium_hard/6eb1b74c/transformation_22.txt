===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about applying bottom-up dynamic programming by initializing a 2D array for the minimum number of steps and iteratively updating it based on the prefix and used strings.

The state is a 3D array where each cell stores the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in the text from the current position to the end, given the used strings until that point, and whether we have seen the string s_k before. The dimensions are dp[i][j][k], where i is the current position in the text, j is the number of used strings, and k is a flag indicating whether we have seen the string s_j.

Transition relationship: if string s_k is a substring of text[i:i+len(s_k)], then update dp[i][j][k] by using this string and add 1 to the current step count, otherwise keep the same. If we haven't seen the string before (k == 0), we also mark it as seen by setting k to 1.

Memoization: use a dictionary to store and reuse previously computed results. The key is a tuple of i, j, and k, and the value is the minimum number of steps needed.

Edge cases:
* If it's impossible to color all letters in the text, return -1.
* If there are no strings in the set, return 0 because we don't need any steps.
