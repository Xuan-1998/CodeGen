===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using top-down dynamic programming with memoization, we can create a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state as the set of strings that have been used so far. Formulate the transitions by considering all possible next steps: either using one of the available strings to color some characters red, or giving up and saying it's impossible to color all the letters.

Implement memoization using a dictionary where the key is the current state and the value is the result of the calculation for that state.

To find the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in red, we can start from the empty set of used strings (i.e., no strings have been used) and recursively try to use each string in the set to color characters in the text. For each string, check if it is possible to color some characters using that string without coloring any previously colored characters.

If it's impossible to color any more characters, return -1 as it's not possible to color all letters in red. If we have successfully used a string, increment the step counter and recursively try to use the remaining strings.

To output the steps, for each step, print a pair of indices representing the used string and its starting position in the text.

The plan includes edge cases by considering all possible transitions from any given state and returning -1 if it's impossible to color all letters.
