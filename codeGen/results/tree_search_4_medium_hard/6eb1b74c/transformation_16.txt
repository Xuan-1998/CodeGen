===BEGIN PLAN===
Initialize a 2D dictionary dp where dp[i][s] represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in the text up to position i considering the last used string s.

Iterate over the text from left to right, updating dp[i][s] for each position i and used string s. If the substring from i to i+|s| matches the string s, update dp[i][s] by considering the next position; otherwise, keep dp[i][s] the same.

For strings that have not been used yet, initialize dp[i][s] as 1 + dp[i-1][s], where dp[0][s] = 0 for any s. This represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters up to position i considering string s has just been used.

If it's impossible to color all letters in the text, return -1; otherwise, return dp[|t|][-1], where |t| is the length of the text and [-1] refers to the last used string.

Use memoization with a dictionary to store intermediate results for faster lookups. This can be done by initializing an empty dictionary memo before starting the iteration, and then updating memo[i][s] as needed during the iteration.
