===BEGIN PLAN===
Create a bottom-up dynamic programming approach using a 2D table to store the state of the problem at each step.

Let dp[i][j] represent the minimum number of steps required to cover the first i characters of the text and j unused substrings.

Transition function:
- If the current character can be covered by one of the remaining substrings, increment the number of steps.
- Else, keep the same number of steps.

Base case: dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since no steps are needed to cover an empty text.

Fill up the dp table row by row from left to right and top to bottom. For each cell, apply the transition function.

Once the dp table is filled, start backtracking from the bottom-right corner to find the optimal sequence of substrings used to cover the text.

Return the value stored in dp[|t|[j] as the minimum number of steps needed.
