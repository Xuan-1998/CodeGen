===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using bottom-up dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating an iterative function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state as a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters from position i to j in the text.
Formulate transition relationships based on whether the string at this position is present in any of the given strings or not:

- If the current character matches one of the given strings, update dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i+|s|][j]) + 1
- Otherwise, update dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]

Use a nested loop structure to iterate over the text and for each character in the text, check if it matches any of the given strings, and update the minimum number of steps accordingly.

To avoid redundant calculations, use memoization by storing the computed values of dp[i][j] in a separate 2D array mem.

When calculating dp[i][j], first check if mem[i][j] is already computed. If it is, return its value. Otherwise, compute the value using the transition relationships and store it in mem[i][j].
