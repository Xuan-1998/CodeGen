===BEGIN PLAN===
Create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters up to position i in the text t using at most j strings.
Begin by initializing the base cases: 
- When i reaches the end of the text, set dp[i][j] = j (since we can use the remaining strings to color the rest of the text).
- When j exceeds the maximum allowed number of strings, set dp[i][j] = -1 (since it's impossible to color the text with more than n strings).

For each position i in the text t:
- If the character at position i is part of a string that has been used previously, simply copy the value from the previous row: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j].
- Otherwise, iterate over all possible strings s_k to see if it can be used to color the current character and the remaining text.
  - For each string s_k:
    - Calculate the number of steps needed to color the remaining text using at most j-1 strings: dp[i-len(s_k)][j-1].
    - If this is less than or equal to the minimum number of steps needed so far, update dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-len(s_k)][j-1].

Finally, return dp[|t|-1][n], which represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in the text t using at most n strings.
