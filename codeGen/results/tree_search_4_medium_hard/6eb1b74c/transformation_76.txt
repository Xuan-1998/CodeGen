===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming with memoization:
\* Define the state as a tuple (pos, used), where pos is the current position in the text and used is a set of strings that have been used so far to color some characters red.
\* Formulate the transitions by considering all possible next steps: either using a string to color some characters red, or moving on to the next character without coloring any characters. For each transition, calculate the new state (pos, used) and store it in the memoization table.
\* Implement top-down dynamic programming with memoization to avoid recalculating the same states multiple times. This can be done using a recursive function that calls itself with different states until it reaches the base case where all characters are colored red or there is no more string left.
To optimize the solution:
\* Use a dictionary to store the memoized states, so that if a state has already been calculated, it can be looked up instead of recalculated.
\* Implement a base case for when all characters have been colored red or there are no strings left. This ensures that the function terminates when the goal is achieved.
