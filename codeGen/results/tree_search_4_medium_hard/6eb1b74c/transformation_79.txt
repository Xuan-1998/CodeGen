===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using bottom-up dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state as a 2D table dp where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all characters up to index i in the text t, given the available strings s_1 to s_n. The available strings are represented by a set S.

Formulate the transitions by considering all possible next steps:

* If string s_k is in set S and it covers some part of the text t from index i to j, then we can try to use this string to color those characters red. This corresponds to dp[i][j] = dp[i][k-1] + 1.
* If no available strings cover any part of the text t from index i to j, then we have to give up and say it's impossible to color all the letters. This corresponds to dp[i][j] = -1.

Use dynamic programming with memoization by filling in the table dp[0][j] for each column j. Then fill in the rest of the table bottom-up from left to right, using previously computed values.

For the output, if it's impossible to color all the letters, print a single line containing the number -1. Otherwise, on the first line, print the number m which is the minimum number of steps it will take to turn all the letters red. Then in the next m lines print pairs of indices: w_j and p_j (1 <= j <= m), which denote that the string with index w_j was used as a substring to cover the occurrences starting in the text t from position p_j.
