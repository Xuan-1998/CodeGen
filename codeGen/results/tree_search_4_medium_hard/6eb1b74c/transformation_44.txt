===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using top-down dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in text t[:i+1] in red, considering only strings s_1, ..., s_j as candidates for coloring.

Base case: For any string t and set of strings {s_1, ..., s_n}, the minimum number of steps needed is 0 if all letters in t are already colored in red.

Recursive step: To minimize the number of steps, try to color as many characters in t[:i+1] as possible using strings from s_1, ..., s_j. Then recursively call the function on the remaining part of the text and subtract one from the result, because we've used one string to color some characters.

Memoization: Store the results of expensive function calls so that they can be reused later to avoid redundant calculations.

Edge cases:
- If all letters in t are already colored in red, return 0.
- If no strings s_1, ..., s_n can be used to color any characters in t, return -1.
