===BEGIN PLAN===
Create a 2D array dp of size (|t| + 1) x (n + 1), where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters up to position i in the text considering the last used string is s_j.
Initialize each element as -1. For each substring of t from i = 0 to |t|, calculate the minimum number of steps by considering all possible last used strings s_j in S:
- If the substring from i to i+|s_j| matches the string s_j, then update dp[i][j] to be min(dp[i][j], dp[i - |s_j|][k]) + 1, where k is such that the substring from i - |s_j| to i matches s_k.
- Otherwise, keep dp[i][j] as -1. 
After filling up the dp array, find the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in the text by finding the smallest value in the last row of dp.

Print this value on the first line, followed by a sequence of pairs (w_j, p_j) such that:
- w_j is the index of the string used as a substring to cover occurrences starting from position p_j.
This can be done by iterating through the dp array and printing out indices j such that dp[i][j] >= m, where m is the minimum number of steps found. For each such j, find the first i such that dp[i][j] = m - 1, and print out (j, i). 
This process can be optimized by iterating through the dp array in reverse order.
