===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using top-down dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
\

Use a bottom-up approach and create a two-dimensional array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in the substring t[:i+1] using the first j strings from s_1, s_2, ..., s_j.

Create an array memoization for memoization purposes. Initialize it with -1.

For each string s_i, iterate over its length and check if the current character is equal to any of the characters in s_i. If yes, mark this position in t[:i+1] as colored.

For each pair (i, j), calculate dp[i][j] based on the minimum number of steps needed for substrings t[:i] using the first j strings from s_1, s_2, ..., s_j and substrings t[:i-1] using the first j strings from s_1, s_2, ..., s_j.

If dp[i][j] is calculated as -1, it means that there's no way to color all letters in substring t[:i+1] using the first j strings. In this case, return -1.

Update memoization with dp[i][j].

After calculating dp[n-1][n-1], print out the minimum number of steps and the pairs of indices w_j and p_j denoting which string was used to cover the occurrences starting from position p_j in t[:i+1].
