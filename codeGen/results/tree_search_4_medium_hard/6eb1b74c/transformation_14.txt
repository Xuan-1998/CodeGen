===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about applying top-down dynamic programming by defining a function that calculates the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in the text up to a given position.

Define state as (i, j), where i is the current position in the text and j is the index of the last string used. The transition relationship can be: if the string at index i matches one of the strings ending at index j, then update j to the new index and increment the minimum number of steps; otherwise, keep j unchanged.

Define a 2D array, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps to color all letters in the text up to position i, considering the strings used up to index j. Initialize it with infinite values for all states except the base case (0, 0), which has 0 as its value.

The recursive function can be: if there's a match between the string at index i and one of the strings ending at index j, then calculate the minimum number of steps needed to color letters up to position i-1 considering the strings used up to index j+1; otherwise, keep the same value as dp[i-1][j].

To find the answer, iterate over all positions in the text, and for each position, find the minimum number of steps by iterating over all possible last strings used. The minimum number of steps is the smallest one among all these possibilities.

Finally, output the result along with a trace of which strings were used at which positions.
