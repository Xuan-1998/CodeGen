===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using top-down dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Represent the state as a tuple (s_i, p) where s_i is a string from the set S and p is its starting position in the text t. This could help to avoid redundant calculations by only considering substrings that can be covered using the remaining strings.

Use top-down dynamic programming with memoization by creating a recursive function dp(s_i, p) that returns the minimum number of steps required to cover all characters in the substring t[p..] using the remaining strings s_j (j > i).

The base case is when there are no more strings left or when all characters in the current substring have been covered. In this case, return 0.

For each string s_j (j > i), calculate the minimum number of steps required to cover all characters in the substring t[p+len(s_i)..] using the remaining strings s_k (k > j). If it's possible to cover the entire substring using s_j, add 1 to the result and update p.

Memoize the results for each string and position to avoid redundant calculations.

Finally, return the minimum number of steps required to cover all characters in the text t.
