===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using bottom-up dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating an iterative function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

\
Define the state as the current position in the text, and formulate transition relationships based on whether the string at this position is present in any of the given strings or not. The state should also include the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in red up to this point.

Implement an iterative function that takes the current position and strings as arguments, and updates the memoized values based on whether the string at this position is present in any of the given strings or not. This function will calculate the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in red and store it in a memo array.

To find the optimal solution, iterate through the text from left to right, updating the memo array at each step based on whether the string at this position is present in any of the given strings or not. The memo array will contain the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in red up to this point.

Finally, output the result by iterating through the memo array and printing the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in red.
