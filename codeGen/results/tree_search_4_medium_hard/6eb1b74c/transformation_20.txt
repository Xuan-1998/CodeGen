===BEGIN PLAN===
Initialize a 2D array dp of size (|t| + 1) x (n + 1), where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in text[:i+1] given used strings until i.

Iterate from i = |t|-1 down to 0 and j = n-1 down to 0:
    If there is no string s_j that can be used at position i, then dp[i][j] = -1.
    Otherwise, consider the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in text[:i+1] given used strings until i, and also considering the last used string s_j. This is represented by dp[i-1][w_j] + 1, where w_j is the index of the last used string.
    Update dp[i][j] with the minimum value between this case and not using the last string (dp[i][j-1][k] for k < j).
    If dp[i][j] = -1, then it's impossible to color all letters in text[:i+1], so break the loop.
    Otherwise, update the used strings by adding s_j at position i.

Return dp[0][n-1].

This plan should be correct and can be improved by using memoization with a dictionary where keys are tuples of (i, j) and values are the calculated minimum number of steps. This can significantly reduce the time complexity.
The potential issue with this plan is that it might not handle edge cases correctly, such as when there are no strings in the set or when all letters in the text can be colored in one step.
This plan includes edge cases by considering the base case where there are no more strings to use and returning -1 if it's impossible to color all letters. It also considers the base case where all letters can be colored in one step and returns 0.
