===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using bottom-up dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Consider representing the state of the dp table as a tuple (i, j) where i is the current index in the text t and j is the number of strings that have been used so far.
Memoize the state (i, j) and use it to avoid redundant calculations while exploring possible combinations of string usage.

 Initialize an array dp with size (|t| + 1) * (n + 1) filled with -1. This will store the minimum number of steps for each substring of t up to i characters long using at most j strings.
 
 Set dp[0][j] = 0 for all 0 <= j <= n, as no steps are needed if we have used j strings and reached the start of the text.
 Initialize an integer result variable set to -1.

 Iterate over each character in t from left to right. For each character:
   If it is not part of any string in S:
     Set dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] for all 0 <= j <= n, as we do not need more steps.
   Otherwise:
     Find the first string s that contains this character and its index k. 
     Update dp[i][j] by taking the minimum of the following two options:
       dp[k][j-1] + 1 (use the current string)
       dp[i][j]
    If dp[i][n] is -1, set result = -1; otherwise, set result to dp[|t|][n].

 Print the value of result and then iterate over each pair of indices (i, j) such that dp[i][j] is not -1.
   For each pair:
     Find the first string s that contains this character and its index k. 
     Print k and i.
