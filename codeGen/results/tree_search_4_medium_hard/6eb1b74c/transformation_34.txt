===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using bottom-up dynamic programming with tabulation to solve this problem by creating a 2D array where the cell at row i and column j represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in the text up to index i using the first j strings.

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in the text up to index i using the first j strings.
Initialize dp[0][0] = 0, as it takes no steps to color an empty string.
Iterate over each string s in S:
    Iterate over each position p from 1 to |t| - |s| + 1:
        If the substring of t from p-1 to p+|s|-2 contains s, update dp[p][j] = min(dp[p][j], dp[p-|s|][j-1] + 1)
Return the minimum value in the last column of dp as the result.
