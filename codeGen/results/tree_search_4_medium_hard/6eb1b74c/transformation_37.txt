===BEGIN PLAN===
Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in the substring t[0..i] in red using the strings s_1, s_2, ..., s_n. Initialize the base case for i=0.

Iterate through each character c in the text t from left to right. For each character:
  - Iterate through each string s_i in the set.
  - If the current substring t[i..j] matches the string s_i, update dp[i][j] with the minimum of its current value and dp[i+len(s_i)-1][j+len(s_i)-1] + 1.

To construct the final solution, iterate through each character c in the text t from left to right. For each character:
  - If there is no string that can be used to color this character red (i.e., all strings have been used), return -1.
  - Otherwise, use a string that can be used to color this character red and decrement its length.

Print the minimum number of steps needed as well as the pairs of indices w_j and p_j for j=1 to m.
