===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about applying bottom-up dynamic programming by initializing a 3D array for the minimum number of steps and iteratively updating it based on the prefix and used strings.

A state represents a tuple of (last_string_used, last_covered_position); the base case is when no string has been used.

The transition relationship is defined as: dp[i][j][k] = min(dp[i-1][j][l]) + 1 if s[last_string_used] appears at or after k, otherwise -1; where i is the current position in text t, j is an integer from 0 to n-1 representing the index of a string in the set that was used most recently, and k is the current position in text t that was covered by the last used string.

Implement memoization using a dictionary where the key is the state (last_string_used, last_covered_position) and the value is the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in red up to each position in text t, given that the last string used is from index i and the last covered position is j.

Calculate the minimum number of steps by iterating over the 3D array and finding the smallest value at the end. If this value is greater than or equal to |t|, it means all letters have been colored red, otherwise return -1.

If the minimum number of steps is less than |t|, calculate the sequence of strings used by tracing back from the end of the 3D array to the start, using the state as the key in the dictionary and updating the last_string_used and last_covered_position accordingly. Print this sequence along with the corresponding positions.
