===BEGIN PLAN===
Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in t up to index i using at most j strings.
Initialize dp with a large value, such as INT_MAX or -1, for indices outside the range [0, |t|].
For each string s_i, find its last occurrence in t and mark it in the array.
Top-down dynamic programming approach: 
For each character c in t:
    For each possible number of strings used, j:
        If all characters before index i have been colored red, then dp[i][j] is the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in t up to index i using at most j-1 strings.
        Else, find the last occurrence of any string s_i in the remaining text and update dp[i][j].
Bottom-up dynamic programming approach: 
For each character c in t:
    For each possible number of strings used, j:
        If all characters before index i have been colored red, then dp[i][j] is the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in t up to index i using at most j-1 strings.
        Else, update dp[i][j] by trying all possible combinations of using a string and not using it.
Return the value of dp[|t|-1][n], which represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in t.
If this value is -1 or greater than n, return -1 because it's impossible to color all letters in t.
Otherwise, use backtracking to find the optimal sequence of strings used and print the result.
