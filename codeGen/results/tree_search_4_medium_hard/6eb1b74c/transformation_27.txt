===BEGIN PLAN===
Initialize 2D array dp with dimensions |t| x (n+1) where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in red up to position i in text t, given that the last string used is from index j.
dp[0][i] = 0 for each i, representing that no strings have been used yet.
For each position i in text t:
    For each possible last string used (j from 0 to n-1):
        Initialize dp[i][j] = -1
        For each possible last covered position k in the range [0, i]:
            If s[j] appears at or after k in text t:
                Update dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[k-1][last_string_used] + 1) where last_string_used is the index of the string that was used most recently
                Update dp[i][j] with the new minimum number of steps required to color all letters in red up to position i, given that the last string used is from index j and the last covered position is k
        Return dp[|t|-1][0], representing the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in red
