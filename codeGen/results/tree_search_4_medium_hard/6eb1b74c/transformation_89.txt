===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using top-down dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

View the state as a combination (text_left, strings_used) where text_left represents the remaining part of the text to be colored and strings_used keeps track of the number of strings used, with transitions based on whether the next character in the text can be colored using one of the remaining strings.

Define base cases: if all characters in the text have been colored (text_left is empty), or if there are no more strings left (strings_used equals n), then we've reached a solution.

For each step, try to color the first character in text_left with one of the remaining strings. If successful, recursively explore the remaining text and update the number of strings used. If not, backtrack and try the next string.

To avoid redundant calculations, use memoization to store intermediate results in a dictionary (dp) where the key is the state (text_left, strings_used) and the value is the minimum number of steps needed to color all characters in text_left using strings_used.

The base case transitions will be added to the dictionary as we explore the states. This allows us to reuse calculations for subproblems instead of recalculating them.

Use a while loop to iterate over the test cases, reading the input and updating the dp dictionary accordingly.

Finally, print the minimum number of steps needed to color all characters in the text using the provided strings, along with the string indices used in each step. If it's impossible to color all characters, output -1.
