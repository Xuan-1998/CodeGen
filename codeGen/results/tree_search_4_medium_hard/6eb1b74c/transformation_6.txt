===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming with memoization by creating a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text from index i to j, given a certain prefix and a set of used strings.

Define two state variables:
* count: an integer representing the current count of steps taken
* used_strings: a set representing the strings already used

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text from index i to j, given a certain prefix and a set of used strings.

For each cell dp[i][j]:
    Initialize dp[i][j] = count + 1 (assuming it takes one step to cover the current substring)
    For each string s in the set:
        If s is a substring of the text from index i to j:
            Update dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i- len(s)+1][j-1]) + 1
            Add s to used_strings

Return dp[0][|t|-1]
