===BEGIN PLAN===
Create a 2D array dp of size (|t| + 1) x (n + 1) to store the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text given a certain prefix and a set of used strings. Initialize dp[0][i] = 0 for all i, since it takes no steps to color an empty string.
Define two state variables: count representing the current count of steps taken, and used_strings representing the strings already used. Initialize count = 0 and used_strings = set().
Formulate state and transition relationships based on these states:
- If the current character in the text is not covered by any of the strings, increment count and continue to the next character.
- If the current character in the text is covered by string s_i and it's not been used before, update dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][k] + 1) for all k != i, where i is the length of s_i. This represents the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text given that string s_i has been used.
- If the current character in the text is covered by string s_i and it's already been used before, update dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][k] + 1) for all k != i. This represents the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text given that string s_i has been reused.
- If the current character in the text is not covered by any strings, increment count and continue to the next character.
Return dp[|t|][j] as the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text. If it's impossible to color all letters of the text in red, return -1.
