===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming with memoization by creating a 2D array to store the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text given a certain prefix and a set of used strings.

dp_state
Create a 2D array dp with dimensions (|t| + 1) x n, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text given a prefix of length i and using the strings s_1, ..., s_j.

Initialize the base case as dp[0][j] = 0 for j ranging from 0 to n-1.
Create another 2D array last_used where last_used[i][j] represents the index of the last string used in the prefix of length i when using the strings s_1, ..., s_j.

Fill up the dp table row by row. For each row i, fill it up from left to right:
- If there's no substring in s_1, ..., s_last_used[i-1] that can cover any part of the remaining text (i.e., t[i-|t|...]), then dp[i][j] = -1.
- Otherwise, find the minimum number of steps required by considering all possible choices of strings to color the next character in the text:
  * For each string s_k in s_1, ..., s_last_used[i-1], consider using it to cover the next character in the text. Calculate the number of steps required and update dp[i][j] if necessary.
  * If none of the above strings can be used to color the next character, then dp[i][j] = -1.

Finally, output the minimum number of steps required (dp[|t|][n-1]) and the sequence of string indices and positions in the text that achieve this minimum number of steps.
