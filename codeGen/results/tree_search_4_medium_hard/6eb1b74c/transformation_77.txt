===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming with memoization:

1. Define the state as (text position, number of strings used): 
    This means we need to keep track of two things:
    - The current position in the text
    - The number of strings that have been used so far

2. Formulate the transitions by considering all possible next steps: 
    For each step, consider two options:
    - Use a string to color some characters red
    - Move on to the next character without coloring any characters

3. Implement memoization by storing the results of recursive calls in a dictionary that maps tuples of (text position, number of strings used) to the corresponding minimum number of steps: 
    This way, each subproblem is solved only once, avoiding redundant calculations

4. Use this state and transitions to define a recursive function that calculates the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in red
5. To improve efficiency, consider using a priority queue to select the most promising next step at each point
6. Handle edge cases: 
    - What if there are no more strings left but some characters in the text are not colored yet?
    - How do we handle the case where it's impossible to color all letters in red?
