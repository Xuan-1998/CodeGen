===BEGIN PLAN===
Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in the substring t[0...i-1] using only substrings s_1, ..., s_j.

Top-down dynamic programming approach:
    - Initialize dp with a grid filled with infinity values.
    - Define a recursive function f(i, j) that returns the minimum number of steps needed to cover the first i characters of the string t using only the last j strings from the set S.
    - For each pair (i, j), consider all possible ways to use one of the strings s_k in S to color some characters in the substring t[0...i-1].
    - Update dp[i][j] by choosing the minimum number of steps from all possible choices.

Memoization:
    - Store the results of subproblems in a memo dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.
    - Before making any recursive call, check if the result is already present in the memo; if yes, return the stored result.

Bottom-up dynamic programming approach:
    - Start with dp[0][j] = 0 for all j (base case: no characters to cover).
    - For each i and j, update dp[i][j] by considering all possible ways to use one of the strings s_k in S to color some characters in the substring t[0...i-1].
    - Use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Combine top-down and bottom-up approaches:
    - Initialize a 2D array dp with infinity values.
    - Define a recursive function f(i, j) that returns the minimum number of steps needed to cover the first i characters of the string t using only the last j strings from the set S.
    - For each pair (i, j), consider all possible ways to use one of the strings s_k in S to color some characters in the substring t[0...i-1].
    - Update dp[i][j] by choosing the minimum number of steps from all possible choices.
    - Use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Edge cases:
    - Handle edge case where i = 0 (no characters to cover).
    - Handle edge case where j = 0 (no strings left in S).

Return the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in the original string t using only the given substrings.
