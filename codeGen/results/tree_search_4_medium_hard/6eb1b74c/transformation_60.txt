===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bottom-up dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating an iterative function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Initialize a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps needed to color the first i characters in t using strings s1, s2, ..., sn and considering the last j characters of s1 have been used.

Formulate transition relationships based on the number of strings that can be used to color the red characters. For each character in t:
    - If the current character is not part of any string si, increment the number of steps needed.
    - Otherwise, consider using the string si to color the current character and update the dp table accordingly.

Implement memoization by creating a dictionary that maps tuples (i, j) to their corresponding values and update the dictionary as needed. 

For each string si in s1, si2, ..., sn:
    - Calculate the minimum number of steps needed to color the first i characters in t using strings si, si+1, ..., sn and considering the last j characters of si have been used.
    - Update the dp table accordingly.

Use the dp table to determine the minimum number of steps m needed to color all letters in t. 

For each step m:
    - Find the string si that was used to color the corresponding red characters in the text.
    - Print the indices w and p for that string.
