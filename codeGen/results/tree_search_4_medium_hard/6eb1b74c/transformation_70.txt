===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using bottom-up dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Represent the state as a string s from the set S and its starting position p in the text t. This could help to avoid redundant calculations by only considering substrings that can be covered using the remaining strings.

Implement dynamic programming with memoization by defining a recursive function that takes a string and its position in the text as arguments, and use memoization to store intermediate results.

Define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to color all letters of the substring t[0..j] using at most i strings from S. If j is within the range of any string s_i in S, consider covering that part first, then use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Base case: dp[0][j] = 1 for j >= 0, because we can always color all letters of an empty substring using zero strings.

Recursive case: dp[i][j] = 1 if and only if there exists a string s_k in S such that:

1. The length of the substring t[p..p+len(s_k)-1] is greater than or equal to len(s_k) for some p >= j - len(s_k) + 1.
2. dp[i-1][p+len(s_k)-1] = 1, meaning we can color all letters of the remaining substring using at most i-1 strings.

If it's possible to color all letters of the entire text t using at most n strings from S, then calculate the minimum number of steps m as the maximum length of any string in S plus one. Then, for each step j (0 <= j < m), output a pair of indices: w_j and p_j, which denote that the string with index w_j was used as a substring to cover the occurrences starting in the text t from position p_j.

If it's impossible to color all letters of the entire text t using at most n strings from S, then output -1.
