===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming with memoization by creating a 3D array to store the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text given a certain prefix and a set of used strings.

dp_state
Use a 4D array dp with dimensions (|t| + 1) x n x n x n, where dp[i][j][k][l] represents the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text given a prefix of length i, using the strings s_1, ..., s_j, and considering the last character of the prefix is from the string s_k. This will help us decide whether we should use the current string or not.

Create a 4D array dp with dimensions (|t| + 1) x n x n x n to store the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text given a prefix and using the strings s_1, ..., s_n. Initialize it with -1 for each state that is not achievable.

dp_init
Fill in the base case: dp[0][i][j][k] = 0 if i == j and k == i, meaning we can color all letters in an empty text using no strings. Fill in the transition rules:
- If there are more characters left to be colored than strings left to use (dp[i][j][k][l] = dp[i-1][j-1][k-1][l-1]), then the minimum number of steps is the same as before.
- Otherwise, consider two options: 
  - Use the current string s_j and increment the count by 1. The new state becomes dp[i-1][j-1][k-1][l-1] + 1.
  - Do not use the current string. The new state remains dp[i-1][j][k][l].

dp_fill
Fill in the rest of the array using the transition rules. Start from the base case and move up.

ans
The minimum number of steps required to color all letters is stored in dp[|t|][n-1][n-1][n-1]. If this value is still -1, it means it's impossible to color all letters, so print -1. Otherwise, find the strings used by following the path from dp[|t|][n-1][n-1][n-1] back to the base case.
