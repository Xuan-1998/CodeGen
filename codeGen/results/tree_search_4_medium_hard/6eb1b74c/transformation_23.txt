===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about applying bottom-up dynamic programming by initializing a 1D array for the minimum number of steps and iteratively updating it based on the prefix and used strings.

The state is a 2D array where each cell stores the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in the text from the current position to the end, given the used strings until that point.
Initialize dp[i][j] as infinity for all i and j. This represents the maximum possible number of steps required.

Transition relationship: if string s_k is a substring of text[i:i+len(s_k)], then update dp[i][j] by using this string and add 1 to the current step count, otherwise keep the same.
Start from the end of the text and work backwards. For each position i in the text, iterate over all strings s_k up to index n and check if it is a substring of the remaining part of the text (from i to the end). If it is, update dp[i][j] by using this string and add 1 to the current step count.
Finally, return dp[0][0], which represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in the text.
