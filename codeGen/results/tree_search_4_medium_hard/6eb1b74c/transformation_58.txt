===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using top-down dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state as a pair (current_index, colored_characters) and formulate the transition relationship based on whether the next character in the text can be colored by using one of the remaining substrings. The current index represents the position in the original text where we are currently coloring characters, and colored_characters is a set of indices representing which characters have been colored so far.

Define a DP table where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all characters up to index i, considering the remaining substrings. The transition relationship would be: if the character at index i can be colored using one of the remaining substrings (s in S), then we have two options: either use the substring to color this character and increment the count by 1, or skip coloring this character for now and move on to the next one. If the character cannot be colored, then we simply move on to the next one.

The base case would be when we've reached the end of the text (i == |t| - 1). In that case, the minimum number of steps is the number of characters that are not in colored_characters, which represents how many more substrings we need to use to color all characters. If no characters can be colored by using any of the remaining substrings, then it's impossible to color all letters of the text t in red and we output -1.
