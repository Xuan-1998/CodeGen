===BEGIN PLAN===
Create a 2D memoized array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in t[0:i] given that strings s_1, s_2, ..., s_j have been used. 
\ 
Fill the base case for dp[0][j] which represents the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in an empty string. This should be 0.
\
Initialize a variable min_steps as INF (Infinity) or -1 to keep track of the overall minimum number of steps.
\
Create a recursive function that takes the current position i and the strings seen so far j as inputs, and returns the minimum number of steps required to color all letters starting from that position given those strings have been used. 
\ 
Base case: If i is equal to the length of t, then return 0.
\
Otherwise, for each string s_k in s_1, ..., s_j:
    Calculate the number of new characters covered by s_k starting from position i.
    Recursively call the function with the updated position and strings seen so far (j+1), and add 1 to the result.
    Update min_steps if necessary.
\
Return min_steps.
\ 
Finally, initialize dp[0][0] as 0 and update dp[i][j] for each i from 0 to |t| and j from 0 to n.
\
Read the input strings t and s_1, ..., s_n.
\
For each string in t:
    Initialize a variable pos at the beginning of the string.
    While there are still uncolored characters in the string:
        Calculate the number of new characters covered by any used string starting from position pos.
        Update pos accordingly.
    Print min_steps and the sequence of strings used to cover all characters.
