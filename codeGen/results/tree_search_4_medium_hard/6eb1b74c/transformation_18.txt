===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about applying top-down dynamic programming by initializing a 2D array for the minimum number of steps and iteratively updating it based on the prefix and used strings.

The state is a 2D array where each cell stores the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in the text from the current position to the end, given the used strings until that point.

State: dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in text[:i+1] (from start to j) given used strings until i.

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in text[:i+1] (from start to j) given used strings until i.

For each cell, consider two possibilities: either we use a string from the set or we don't. If we use a string, find the first occurrence of that string and update dp[i][j] based on whether it is possible to color all letters up to that point in one step. If not, recursively try to color the letters before that occurrence.

For each cell where we don't use a string, recursively consider coloring the letters from the start to j-1 if there are no strings available or update dp[i][j] based on whether it is possible to color all letters up to j-1 in one step. If not, try to color the letters before that occurrence.

To avoid unnecessary computation and improve efficiency, use memoization by storing previously computed values in a separate 2D array and check for them before computing new ones.

Initialize dp[0][j] as -1 for all j because it is impossible to color any letters without strings. Then fill up the dp array based on the plan above.

To find the minimum number of steps, iterate over the dp array from bottom to top (i.e., from larger i values to smaller ones) and update a variable m with the maximum value found.

To output how many times we used each string, initialize an array counts where counts[i] stores the frequency of string s_i. Then for each step in the optimal solution, update the corresponding count and finally print the pair w_j and p_j if the current count is greater than 0.

Print m as the minimum number of steps on a separate line followed by m lines containing pairs of indices: w_j and p_j (1 ≤ j ≤ m), which denote that the string with index w_j was used as a substring to cover the occurrences starting in the text from position p_j. The pairs can be output in any order.
