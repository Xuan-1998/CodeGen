===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using bottom-up dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating an iterative function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state as a tuple of (text index, remaining substrings) and formulate the transition relationship based on whether the current character in the text matches any of the remaining substrings.

Employ a combination of both tabulation and memoization, utilizing a 2D table for storing intermediate results and a dictionary for caching the outcomes of subproblems.

Initialize an empty dictionary to store the memoized values and a 2D table with dimensions (|t| + 1) x (n + 1), where |t| is the length of the text and n is the number of strings. The extra row and column account for the base case when the text index or remaining substrings become empty.

Iterate through each character in the text and for each character, iterate through each string in the set. If the current character matches any of the characters in the current string, update the table with the minimum number of steps required to color all letters of the text red using the strings up to that point. This is achieved by recursively calling the function on the remaining substring and incrementing the step count.

If it is impossible to color all letters of the text red using the strings, return -1.

Once the table is populated, iterate through each cell in the bottom-right corner (i.e., |t| x n) to find the minimum number of steps required. If the value is -1, return -1. Otherwise, construct the sequence of strings used to color all letters red by backtracking from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner.

The order of the string indices in the output does not matter as long as they are correct.
