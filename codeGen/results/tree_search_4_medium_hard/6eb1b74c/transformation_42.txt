===BEGIN PLAN===
Create a 2D table dp[i][j] where i is the index of the text and j is the number of strings used so far. Initialize it with -1 for all values.

Fill the base cases by initializing the first row (dp[0][j]) to an empty list for j = 0, because we start coloring from the beginning of the text.

For each character in the text, starting from the second character, do the following:

    Iterate over the strings and check if any string starts at that position. If a string is found, update dp[i][j] to be the list obtained by appending j+1 to the result of the recursive call with i-strlen(s) (the next occurrence of s in t) and j.

    If no string is found, update dp[i][j] to be the same as dp[i-1][j].

Check if all characters have been colored by checking if dp[|t|][n] contains n. If not, return -1 because it's impossible to color all letters in red.

If it's possible to color all letters, print the number of steps m and then for each j from 0 to m-1, print a pair (w_j, p_j) where w_j is the index of the string used in step j+1 and p_j is the position in the text where that string was used.
