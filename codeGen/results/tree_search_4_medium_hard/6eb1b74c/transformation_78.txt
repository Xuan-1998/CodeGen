===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using bottom-up dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

 Define the state as the current position in the text and the set of strings that have been used so far, and then formulate the transitions by considering all possible next steps: either using one of the available strings to color some characters red, or giving up and saying it's impossible to color all the letters.

 Create a memoized function that takes the current state as input (position in text and set of strings used) and recursively calculates the minimum number of steps needed to color all characters red, given the available strings. 

 If we are at the end of the text, return 0 because there's nothing left to color.

 Otherwise, consider all possible next steps:
- For each string that can be used (i.e., it appears at the current position in the text), calculate the number of steps needed if this string is used.
- If using any string results in coloring more characters red than we've already colored, update our result with this minimum.

 Finally, return the minimum number of steps found in all possible next steps. 

 If it's impossible to color all letters (i.e., no strings can be used), return -1.
