===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about applying bottom-up dynamic programming by initializing a 1D array for the minimum number of steps and iteratively updating it based on the prefix and used strings.

A state represents the last string used and its corresponding last covered position; the base case is when no string has been used.
The state represents a tuple of (last_string_used, last_covered_position) where last_string_used is the index of the string in the set that was used most recently, and last_covered_position is the position in text t that was covered by the last used string.

The transition relationship is defined as:
dp[i] = min(dp[i-1][j]) + 1 if s[j] appears at or after i-1, otherwise -1;
where i is the current position in text t.

Applying memoization using a recursive function that returns the minimum number of steps to color all letters up to position i in text t, given the last string used and its corresponding last covered position.

Let's define dp[i] as the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters up to position i.
For each string s[j], we update dp[i] as follows:
- If the string is not used yet (i.e., dp[i][j] = -1), then dp[i] remains the same.
- If the string is used and it appears at or after position i, then dp[i] is updated to dp[i-1][j] + 1.

The base case is when i equals the length of text t; in this case, dp[i] = -1 if all letters are already colored red.

To find the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters of the text in red and how to do it, we can iterate over the dynamic programming table from right to left and backtrack from the end.
We start at position i equal to the length of the text t; then we move backwards until we reach a position where a string was used. At each step, we keep track of which string was used and its corresponding last covered position.

This way, we can construct a sequence of strings that allows us to color all letters in the text in red with the minimum number of steps.
