===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming with memoization by creating a 3D array dp with dimensions (|t| + 1) x n x n, where:
dp[i][j][k] represents the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text given a prefix of length i and using the strings s_1, ..., s_k.

Initialize memoization dictionary md.
Iterate over each position j in the text t from 0 to |t| - 1:
For each position j, iterate over each used string s_i (1 <= i <= k):
    If the current substring of length i ending at j contains string s_i, 
    update dp[j][i][k] as follows:
        If j is 0, set dp[0][i][k] = 1.
        Else, calculate and update dp[j][i][k] using memoization dictionary md.

After the dynamic programming process is done, initialize variables m and res to represent the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text t and a list of used strings respectively.
Iterate over each position j in the text t from 0 to |t| - 1:
    For each position j, find the minimum number of steps dp[j][i][k] for any string s_i (1 <= i <= k) that ends at j.
    Add the corresponding used string and its ending position to res.

Output m as the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text t and res as a list of used strings.
