===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using top-down dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Think about representing the state as the current position in the text and the set of available substrings to use. The transition relation could be defined as the new set of available substrings after applying a given substring at the current position.
Create a dictionary-based memoization system where each key is a tuple representing the current text position and the set of available substrings, and the value is the minimum number of steps required to color all letters up to that position.

To avoid redundant calculations, consider using a recursive function that takes the current position and set of available substrings as input. The function should return the minimum number of steps required to color all letters up to that position. For each substring in the set, apply it at the current position and recursively call the function with the updated position and new set of available substrings. If the recursive call returns a valid solution (i.e., not -1), update the memoization dictionary with the result.

To improve the plan, consider adding a base case for when the current position is beyond the end of the text or there are no more available substrings to apply. In this case, return 0 as there's nothing else to color.
