===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming with memoization by creating a 2D array to store the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text given a certain prefix and a set of used strings.

dp_state
Create a 3D array dp with dimensions (|t| + 1) x n x n, where dp[i][j][k] represents the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text given a prefix of length i, using the strings s_1, ..., s_j and excluding the string s_k. This will help track which strings have been used and not used.

Create a dictionary memo with default value None, where memo[i][j][k] represents whether the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text given a prefix of length i, using the strings s_1, ..., s_j and excluding the string s_k has been computed or not. Implement memoization by checking if dp_state = memo[i][j][k], and if so, return the stored result.

Initialize an integer variable count to store the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text.
For each character c in the text t:
    For j from 1 to n:
        For k from 0 to j - 1:
            If dp_state = memo[i][j][k]:
                continue
            Initialize an integer variable min_steps to |t| + 1
            For w from k to j:
                If s_w is a substring of t[i...i+len(s_w)-1]:
                    Update min_steps to the minimum between min_steps and dp[i-len(s_w)][w-1][k]
            memo[i][j][k] = min_steps
    count += 1

Return -1 if it's impossible to color all letters in the text, otherwise return count.
