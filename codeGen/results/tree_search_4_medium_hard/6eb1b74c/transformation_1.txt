===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming with memoization by creating a 2D array to store the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text given a certain prefix and a set of used strings.

dp_state
Create a 2D array dp with dimensions (|t| + 1) x n, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text given a prefix of length i and using the strings s_1, ..., s_j.
Initialize the base case as dp[0][j] = j for j ranging from 0 to n-1.

for i from 1 to |t|:
    for j from 0 to min(i, n)-1:
        if dp[i-1][j] != -1: 
            dp[i][j+1] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j] + (s_j in t[0:i]))

for i from |t| to 0 step -1:
    for j from 0 to n-1:
        if dp[i][j] != -1: 
            print(j, i-dp[i][j])
