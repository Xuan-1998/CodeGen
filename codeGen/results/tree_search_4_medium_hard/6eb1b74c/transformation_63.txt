===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using top-down dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

\
View each string as a 'token' that can be used to change the state (number of red characters) from one step to another. Formulate the state and transition relationships by considering how many tokens can be used in each step to change the state.
Implement memoization using a dictionary to store previously computed results, which can be looked up quickly when needed, rather than recomputing them.

Define the base case for the recursive function: if all characters in the text have been colored red, return 0 as the minimum number of steps. This will serve as the termination condition for the recursion.

Implement memoization by storing previously computed results in a dictionary where keys are tuples representing the current state and position in the text, and values are the minimum number of steps needed to color all characters red given that state.
Use this dictionary to avoid recomputing results when the same subproblem is encountered again during the recursive call.
