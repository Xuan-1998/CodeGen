===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using bottom-up dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Initialize a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps required to color all letters from index i to j in text t.

Create a recursive function dfs(i, j) that takes two indices i and j as input. This function will return the minimum number of steps required to color all letters from index i to j in text t.

For each string si in the set of strings, check if it is present in the substring of text t from index i to j. If it is, update dp[i][j] with the minimum value between its current value and dfs(i + |si|, j) (i.e., try coloring all letters from index i to j using string si).

If no string is found that can be used to color all letters from index i to j, return -1 as it's impossible to color all letters in this range.

Iterate over the 2D array dp and backtrace the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in text t. For each step, find the string that was used to color the corresponding substring of text t.
