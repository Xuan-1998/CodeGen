===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming with memoization by creating a 2D array to store the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in the text given a certain prefix and a set of used strings.

Let dp[i][j] be true if it's possible to color all letters in the text from index i to j, given a certain prefix and a set of used strings. Initialize dp with zeros.

For each string s in the set:
  For each index k from 0 to t.length() - s.length():
    If s is equal to the substring of t from index k to k + s.length(), update dp[k][k + s.length()] to be true if and only if it's possible to color all letters in the text from index i to j, given a certain prefix and a set of used strings.

Define an integer state variable count representing the current count of steps taken, and a set state variable used_strings representing the strings already used. Initialize count and used_strings with 0 and an empty set, respectively.

State: dp[i][j], (count, used_strings)
Transition:
  If s is equal to the substring of t from index i to j, then
    (i + len(s), used_strings.add(s)) if count + 1 < minSteps
    else false

For each test case:
  Initialize dp with zeros.
  For each string s in the set:
    For each index k from 0 to t.length() - s.length():
      If s is equal to the substring of t from index k to k + s.length(), update dp[k][k + s.length()] to be true if and only if it's possible to color all letters in the text from index i to j, given a certain prefix and a set of used strings.
  Return minSteps - 1, where minSteps is the smallest number of steps required to color all letters in the text.
