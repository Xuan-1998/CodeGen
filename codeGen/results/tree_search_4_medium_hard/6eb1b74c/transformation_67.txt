===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using bottom-up dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Consider representing the state of the dp table as a tuple (i, j) where i is the current index in the text t and j is the number of strings that have been used so far.

DP with memoization can be implemented by defining a recursive function dp(i, j) that returns the minimum number of steps required to color all letters in t up to index i using at most j strings. This function should return -1 if it's impossible to color all letters in t up to index i using at most j strings.

To improve the plan, consider initializing a 2D array dp with size (len(t) + 1) * (n + 1) and fill the base case where i = len(t). Then fill the dp table from bottom-up by iterating over all possible pairs of (i, j).

The potential issue with this plan is that it might not be efficient if the input strings are very long or there are many strings. In such cases, you might need to use a more advanced data structure like Trie.

This plan does include edge cases where i = len(t) and all possible combinations of (i, j).
