===BEGIN PLAN===
Using bottom-up dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

View the state as a combination (text_left, strings_used) where text_left represents the remaining part of the text to be colored and strings_used keeps track of the number of strings used, with transitions based on whether the next character in the text can be colored using one of the remaining strings.

Create a 2D array dp[n+1][n+1] where dp[i][j] is the minimum number of steps required to color all characters in the text for prefix i and j strings used. The base case would be when i is equal to the length of the text or when j is equal to 0, both representing the end of the text or no more strings left respectively.

Transition rules:
- If the current character matches the beginning of any string, take the minimum number of steps required to color all characters in the remaining text with this string used and the next string, along with the current string.
- If the current character does not match the beginning of any string, do not use any strings for coloring at this step.

Return dp[|t|][0] as the minimum number of steps required to color all characters in the text, where |t| is the length of the text. 

For each step taken, store the pair (w_j and p_j) representing the string used and its starting position in the text.
