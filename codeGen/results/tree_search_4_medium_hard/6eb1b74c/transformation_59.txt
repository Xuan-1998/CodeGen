===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using top-down dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state as a tuple (i, colored) where i is the current index in the text and colored is a set of characters that have been colored. Formulate the transition relationship based on whether the next character in the text can be colored by using one of the remaining substrings.

Create a memoization dictionary dp to store the solutions to subproblems. Initialize it with default values -1, which represents an impossible coloring.

Use a recursive function to solve the problem. If the current index i is out of bounds or all characters have been colored, return 0 as the minimum number of steps. Otherwise, for each substring s in the set, check if the substring can be used to color any uncolored character at index i. If it can, recursively call the function with the updated state and add 1 to the result.

Store the result in dp[(i, colored)] and return it.

To find the minimum number of steps, start from the end of the text and work backwards. For each pair (i, colored) in reverse order, check if dp[(i, colored)] is already computed. If not, compute it recursively and store it in the dictionary.

Finally, initialize a variable res to -1 and iterate over the pairs (w_j, p_j) to find the minimum number of steps. For each pair, use the stored results in dp to compute the minimum number of steps needed to color all characters up to position p_j using the string with index w_j. Update res if this result is smaller.

Print res as the minimum number of steps and then print the pairs (w_j, p_j) that achieve this minimum.
