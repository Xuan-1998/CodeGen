===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using top-down dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Consider representing the state of the dp table as a tuple (i, j) where i is the current index in the text t and j is the number of strings that have been used so far. This allows us to keep track of the remaining strings and the position in the text.

A memoized recursive function can be implemented by defining a dictionary dp where the keys are tuples (i, j) and the values are the minimum number of steps required for that state.

To further improve this plan, consider adding base cases for when all strings have been used or there are no more occurrences of any string in the text. This helps prevent redundant calculations.

The potential issue with this plan is that it may still perform redundant calculations if the same subproblem is encountered multiple times during the recursive process. To mitigate this, consider using a combination of memoization and tabulation to store previously computed values and avoid redundant calculations.

The plan includes edge cases such as when all strings have been used or there are no more occurrences of any string in the text.
