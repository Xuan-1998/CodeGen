===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using top-down dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Consider the state as a tuple (i, j) where i is the current position in the text t and j is the number of strings used so far, with base cases when i reaches the end of the text or j exceeds the maximum allowed. 

Memoize the recursive function by storing intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations, possibly by creating a dictionary memo that maps tuples (i, j) to their corresponding solutions.

For each string s in the set, calculate the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters up to position i in the text t using this string. If no strings are used, return 0.

Create a list dp where dp[i] is the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters up to position i in the text t.

For each string s in the set, update dp[i] by considering two possibilities: either use the current string to cover some part of the text, or don't use it. 

If using the string, calculate the new position and the number of strings used so far, then recursively call the function with these new parameters.

Otherwise, increment the current step count and move on to the next character.

Finally, return dp[|t|] as the minimum number of steps needed to color all letters in the text t.

For each step, print the index of the string used and its position in the text.
