===BEGIN PLAN===
Explore using top-down dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem by creating a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

View each string as a 'token' that can be used to change the state (number of red characters) from one step to another. Formulate the state and transition relationships by considering how many tokens can be used in each step to change the state.

Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of steps required to color all characters up to index j in string t using the first i strings.

Initialize dp with values -1, since it's impossible to color any characters initially. 

Iterate over the length of string t and for each character, calculate the maximum number of tokens that can be used in this step. This is done by finding all occurrences of the given strings in the substring from the start index to j.

For each token, update the dp array by considering whether it's better to use this token now or wait until later steps when more characters might become available for coloring.

Finally, return dp[|t|][-1] as the minimum number of steps required to color all characters in string t. 

If dp[|t|][-1] is still -1, then it means that it's impossible to color all characters in the given strings and print -1 instead.
