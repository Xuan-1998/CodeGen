===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose a dynamic programming approach: Bottom-Up Approach with Tabulation.

Consider defining dp[i] as the maximum XOR value that can be obtained from the first i elements. Then the base case could be dp[1] = A[0]^A[1], as we need to consider adding X to either of the first two elements.

The transition relationship could be defined by considering all possible pairs of adjacent elements in the array, finding their XOR value and adding X to one of them if necessary.

Define dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + A[i-1]^A[i]) for 2 <= i <= N

Initialize dp array with X: dp[0] = X, dp[1] = A[0]^A[1]
