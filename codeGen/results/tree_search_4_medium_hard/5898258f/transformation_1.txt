Choose a dynamic programming approach: Bottom-Up Approach with Tabulation
The state expression could be dp[i] = max(dp[k-1] + (A[k]-X)*XOR(A[k+1]) for k in range(2, i+1)). The base case would be dp[0] = 0.
dp[i] = max(dp[k-1] + (A[k]-X)*XOR(A[k+1]) for k in range(2, i+1))
Another option is to use a prefix XOR array pfx, where pfx[j] denotes the XOR sum of elements from A[1] to A[j]. Then dp[i] = max(dp[k-1] + (pfx[k]-X)*XOR(pfx[k+1]) for k in range(2, i)).
The final answer would be the maximum value of the expression âˆ‘(A[i-1] XOR A[i]) that can be obtained by adding X to at most one subsequence of the array A.

This approach focuses on the maximum sum of XOR operations considering the addition of X to a subsequence.
