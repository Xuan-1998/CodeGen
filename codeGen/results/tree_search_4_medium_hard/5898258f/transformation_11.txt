===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose a dynamic programming approach: Top-Down Approach with Memoization
Implementing a recursive function with a dictionary to store intermediate results for faster computation and avoiding redundant calculations.

Base case:
dp[0] = 0, representing the sum for an empty subsequence.

Recursive formula:
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], A[i] XOR (A[i-1]-X)) for i in range(1, N)

This approach emphasizes on updating the maximum sum considering the addition of X to a subsequence.
Using a top-down approach with memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant computations.

Edge cases:
Consider the case where N=0 or all elements in A are equal. In such cases, dp[i] will always be 0.

This plan is correct and provides a good starting point for solving the problem. However, it can be improved by:

* Handling edge cases more explicitly
* Providing a clear base case definition
* Ensuring the recursive formula is well-defined and avoids infinite loops
