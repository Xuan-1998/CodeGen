Choose a dynamic programming approach: Bottom-Up Approach with Tabulation:
Implementing an iterative solution from the base case up to the current state.

The state expression could be dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] + (A[j]-X)*XOR(A[j+1]) for j in range(i)).
The base case would be dp[0] = 0. This approach focuses on the maximum sum of XOR operations considering the addition of X to a subsequence.

dp[i] = dp[i-1]
        if i == 1 else
            max(dp[i-2] + (A[j]-X)*XOR(A[j+1]) for j in range(i))

Top-Down Approach with Memoization: Implementing an iterative solution from the base case up to the current state.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k-1] + (A[k]-X)*XOR(A[k+1]) for k in range(1, i)). The base case would be dp[0][j] = 0. This approach focuses on the maximum sum of XOR operations considering the addition of X to a subsequence.

dp[i][j] = 
        if j == 0 else
            max(dp[i-1][k-1] + (A[k]-X)*XOR(A[k+1]) for k in range(1, i))
