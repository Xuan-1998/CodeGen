Choose a dynamic programming approach: Bottom-Up Approach with Tabulation.

Consider defining dp[i][j] as the maximum XOR value that can be obtained from the first i elements and j elements are considered for adding X. This way, we can avoid redundant calculations by only considering the current state and its predecessors.

Define a state as the current index i and the number of times we have added X to an element so far. Then, consider transitions where we either add X to an element or not, depending on whether it is beneficial for our XOR sum.

The base case could be dp[0][0] = 0, since there are no elements to consider initially.

For the transition from state (i-1, k) to state (i, k+1), we have two options:

* Add X to an element at index i: This would increase the XOR sum by A[i] and add X.
* Do not add X to an element at index i: This would maintain the current XOR sum.

The transition from state (i-1, k) to state (i, k) is straightforward, as we don't change the XOR sum.

The final answer would be dp[N][0], where N is the total number of elements in the array.

This approach should correctly compute the maximum XOR value that can be obtained by adding X at most once.
