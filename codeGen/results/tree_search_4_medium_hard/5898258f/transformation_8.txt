===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose a dynamic programming approach: Bottom-Up Approach with Tabulation.

Fill an array dp of size N+1, initializing dp[0] = 0. Then iterate from i = 1 to N:
- If i is odd, dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], A[i-1] XOR X).
- If i is even, dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i//2] XOR A[i-1]).
This approach takes into account the addition of X to a subsequence.

The base case is dp[0] = 0. This means that when there are no elements in the array, the maximum sum is 0.
