===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose a dynamic programming approach: Top-Down Approach with Memoization.

Base case: dp[0] = 0 (since there's no subsequence to add X to).

Recursive function:
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], A[i] XOR (dp[i-1]-X) for i in range(1, N)).

Memoization dictionary to store intermediate results: memo = {}

Top-down approach with memoization:
- Define a recursive function with the base case and the dp[i] equation.
- For each state dp[i], calculate the maximum sum by considering the addition of X to a subsequence.
- Store the result in the memo dictionary for later use.
- If the result is already stored, return it instead of recalculating.

Bottom-Up Approach with Tabulation:
- Initialize an array dp of size N+1, where dp[i] represents the maximum sum up to the i-th element.
- Iterate from i = 1 to N and calculate dp[i] based on dp[i-1] and A[i].
- At each step, consider adding X to a subsequence and update the dp[i] accordingly.

Edge cases:
- Handle invalid input (e.g., negative N or X).
- Handle edge case where N is 0 or 1.
