Choose a dynamic programming approach: Bottom-Up Approach with Tabulation:

The state expression could be dp[i] = max(dp[j-1] + (A[j]-X) XOR A[j+1]) for j in range(1, i)]. The base case would be dp[0] = 0.

dp[i] = [max(dp[j-1][0] + (A[j]-X) XOR A[j+1]) for j in range(i)]

Use a list to store intermediate results and update the values of the dp table based on previously computed values. This approach focuses on the maximum sum of XOR operations considering the addition of X to a subsequence.

To handle edge cases, initialize dp[0] = 0 and dp[i][j] is not defined for i < j. This ensures that all valid indices are considered during computation.
