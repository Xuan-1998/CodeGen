===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose a dynamic programming approach: Top-Down Approach with Memoization
Implementing a recursive function with a dictionary to store intermediate results

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max((A[j]-X)*XOR(A[j+1]) if j == i-1 else dp[i-1][j-1])

Base case: dp[0][j] = 0
This approach focuses on the maximum sum of XOR operations considering the addition of X to a subsequence

Correctness:
The plan correctly identifies the need for dynamic programming and uses memoization to store intermediate results. However, it could be improved by handling edge cases more explicitly.

Improved Plan:
Initialize dp[0][j] = 0 for all j
For i from 1 to N:
    For j from 1 to N-i+1:
        If j == i-1:
            dp[i][j] = (A[j]-X)*XOR(A[j+1])
        else:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k-1] + (A[k]-X)*XOR(A[k+1]) for k in range(1, i))

Edge Cases:
Handle the case where N == 0 and X is provided
