===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose a dynamic programming approach: Top-Down Approach with Memoization:
The state expression could be dp[i][0] = max(dp[j][1] + (A[j+1]-X)*XOR(A[j+2]) for j in range(0, i)) and dp[i][1] = max(dp[j][0] + A[j+1]*XOR(A[j+2]) for j in range(0, i)). The base case would be dp[0][0] = 0. This approach focuses on the maximum sum of XOR operations considering adding X to at most one subsequence.
Define a function that recursively computes the maximum sum considering adding X to at most one subsequence, and use a dictionary to store the results for memoization.
dp[i] = [max(dp[j][1] + (A[j+1]-X)*XOR(A[j+2]) for j in range(0, i)), max(dp[j][0] + A[j+1]*XOR(A[j+2]) for j in range(0, i))]
