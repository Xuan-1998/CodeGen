Choose a dynamic programming approach: Bottom-Up Approach with Tabulation
Consider defining dp[i][j] as the maximum XOR value that can be obtained from the first i elements and j elements are considered for adding X, then the base case could be dp[0][0] = 0. This approach looks at the possible ways of selecting elements to add X.
The transition relationship could be defined by considering all possible pairs of adjacent elements in the array, finding their XOR value and adding X to one of them if necessary.
Use a 2D table (dp) where dp[i][j] represents the maximum XOR value that can be obtained from the first i elements and j elements are considered for adding X

for N in range(1, n+1):
    dp[0][i] = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for k in range(i):
            if (A[k] ^ A[i-1]) > X:
                continue
            if (dp[k][i-1] + xor_val) > dp[k][i]:
                dp[k][i] = dp[k][i-1] + xor_val
            else:
                dp[k][i] = dp[k][i]

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        if (A[i] ^ A[j]) > X:
            continue
        if (dp[i][j-1] + xor_val) > dp[i][j]:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + xor_val
        else:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j]

print(max(dp[n-1]))
