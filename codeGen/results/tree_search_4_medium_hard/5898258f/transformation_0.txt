===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose a dynamic programming approach: Top-Down Approach with Memoization
The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k-1] + (A[k]-X)*XOR(A[k+1]) for k in range(1, i))
The base case would be dp[0][j] = 0

Let's consider the current subarray A[j..i]. We can either XOR all elements in this subarray or add X to some of them. The maximum value will occur when we XOR all elements if X is close enough to the average, and when we add X to some elements if X is far from the average.

We need a function that takes the current position i, the last added value k, and the current sum of XOR operations s as arguments. This function should calculate the maximum sum of XOR operations considering adding X to any subsequence ending at index i.

The recursive relation could be:
dp[i][j] = max(s + XOR(A[i], A[j]), dp[i-1][k-1] + XOR(A[k]-X, A[i]))

This approach is correct and considers edge cases. To improve the plan, you can add a base case for i=0 to handle the initialization.

The potential issue with this plan could be that it might not consider all possibilities of adding X to some elements. However, by considering adding X to any subsequence ending at index i, we are actually handling this case.
