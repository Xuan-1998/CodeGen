===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose a dynamic programming approach: Top-Down Approach with Memoization and Bottom-Up Approach with Tabulation.

Top-Down Approach:
1. Define dp[i] as the maximum sum that can be obtained by adding X to at most one subsequence ending at index i.
2. Base case: dp[0] = 0.
3. Recursive relation: 
    - If no operation is performed (i.e., the subsequence is not added X), then dp[i] = dp[i-1]
    - If X is added to the subsequence, then dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], A[i] XOR (dp[i-1]-X))
4. Memoization: Store intermediate results in a dictionary to avoid recomputation.

Bottom-Up Approach:
1. Define dp[i] as the maximum sum that can be obtained by adding X to at most one subsequence ending at index i.
2. Base case: dp[0] = 0.
3. Iterative relation:
    - For each i from 1 to N-1, compute dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], A[i] XOR (dp[i-1]-X))
4. Tabulation: Store intermediate results in a list or array to avoid recomputation.

Edge cases:
1. Handle the case where X is added to the first element of the subsequence.
2. Handle the case where no operation is performed (i.e., the original subsequence has the maximum sum).
