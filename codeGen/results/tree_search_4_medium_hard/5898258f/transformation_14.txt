Choose a dynamic programming approach: Bottom-Up Approach with Tabulation

Consider defining dp[i][j] as the maximum XOR value that can be obtained from the first i elements and j elements are considered for adding X, then the base case could be dp[0][0] = 0. This approach looks at the possible ways of selecting elements to add X.

 Define a dictionary dp with size N+1 x (N+X)//2 + 1. Initialize all values in dp as -âˆž. 

For i from 1 to N:
    For j from 0 to min(i, (N+X)//2):
        If j is 0 or i is 1: 
            dp[i][j] = A[0]^A[i-1] if i is 1 else 0
        Else:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k]^A[i-1]^A[i]) for k from 0 to min(j, (N+X)//2)

The final answer will be the maximum value in dp[N][0]
