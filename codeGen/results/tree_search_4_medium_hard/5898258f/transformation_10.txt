Choose a dynamic programming approach: Bottom-Up Approach with Tabulation
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-1] XOR (dp[i-2]-X)) for i in range(1, N+1)
The base case would be dp[0] = 0. This approach emphasizes on updating the maximum sum considering the addition of X to a subsequence.
Iteratively compute the solution from the base case up to the current state using a single loop.
Update the maximum sum considering the addition of X to a subsequence for each element in the array.
This approach takes care of edge cases as well, such as when N is 0 or 1.
