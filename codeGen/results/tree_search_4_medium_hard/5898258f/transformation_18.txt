===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose a dynamic programming approach: Bottom-Up Approach with Tabulation
Consider defining dp[i][j] as the maximum XOR value that can be obtained from the first i elements and j elements are considered for adding X, then the base case could be dp[0][0] = 0. This approach looks at the possible ways of selecting elements to add X.
Define a state as the current index i and the number of times we have added X to an element so far. Then, consider transitions where we either add X to an element or not, depending on whether it is beneficial for our XOR sum.

Initialize dp array with size N+1 (for 0-based indexing) and fill up the base cases: dp[0][0] = 0
Fill up the dp array iteratively using the following transitions:
    dp[i][j]: 
        If j > 0, then consider adding X to the current element. Calculate the maximum XOR value for this transition.
        Otherwise, do not add X and recursively calculate the maximum XOR value.

Initialize max_xor_sum = 0
Iterate through the dp array to find the maximum XOR sum:
    For i from 1 to N: 
        For j from 0 to min(i-1, X): 
            Update max_xor_sum if necessary

Return max_xor_sum as the final answer
