===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose a dynamic programming approach: Bottom-Up Approach with Tabulation:
Implementing an iterative function that iteratively computes the solution from the base case up to the current state.

The state expression could be dp[i] = [max(dp[j-1][0] + A[j]*XOR(A[j+1]) for j in range(1, i)) + X, max(dp[j-1][1] + A[j]*XOR(A[j+1]) for j in range(1, i))] + X.

The base case would be dp[0] = [0, 0]. This approach focuses on the maximum sum of XOR operations considering the addition of X to a subsequence.

Create a 1D array dp where dp[i] represents the maximum sum considering adding X to at most one subsequence from index 0 to i, and update the values based on previously computed values.
