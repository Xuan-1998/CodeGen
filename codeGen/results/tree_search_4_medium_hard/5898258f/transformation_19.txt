===BEGIN PLAN===
Choose a dynamic programming approach: Bottom-Up Approach with Tabulation:

Consider defining dp[i][j] as the maximum XOR value that can be obtained from the first i elements and j elements are considered for adding X, then the base case could be dp[0][0] = 0. This approach looks at the possible ways of selecting elements to add X.

The transition relationship could be defined by considering all possible pairs of adjacent elements in the array, finding their XOR value and adding X to one of them if necessary.

Initialize a table dp with dimensions (N+1) x (X+1), where dp[i][j] represents the maximum XOR value that can be obtained from the first i elements and j elements are considered for adding X.

Fill up the table dp by iterating over all possible pairs of adjacent elements in the array, considering their XOR value and adding X to one of them if necessary. Update dp[i][j] accordingly based on the current state.

In the end, return dp[N][X].
