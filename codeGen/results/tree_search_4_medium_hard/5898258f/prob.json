"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given an array A of N integers and an integer X, find the maximum value of the expression \\u2211(A[i-1] XOR A[i]) for i from 2 to N, where XOR denotes the bitwise XOR operation. You can perform the following operation at most once: select a subsequence of A and add X to all the elements of that subsequence.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of T test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers N and X. The second line contains N integers A[1], A[2], ..., A[N], representing the array A. The input is provided through standard input.\\n\\nOutput: For each test case, output a single integer representing the maximum value of the expression \\u2211(A[i-1] XOR A[i]) that can be obtained by adding X to at most one subsequence of the array A.\\n\\nConstraints: 1 \\u2264 T \\u2264 10^5, 1 \\u2264 N \\u2264 10^5, 1 \\u2264 X \\u2264 10^9, 1 \\u2264 A[i] \\u2264 10^9, and the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Dynamic programming', 'Bit manipulation', 'Mathematics']\", \"difficulties\": \"MEDIUM_HARD\", \"source\": \"codechef\", \"url\": \"https://www.codechef.com/problems/ADJXOR2\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"3\\n2 1\\n1 2\\n4 1\\n2 2 3 3\\n5 2\\n5 3 6 2 8\\n\", \"output\": \"3\\n15\\n43\\n\"}]}"
