Choose a dynamic programming approach: Bottom-Up Approach with Tabulation: Iteratively computing the solution from the base case up to the current state.

Consider defining dp[i][j] as the maximum XOR value that can be obtained from the first i elements and j elements are considered for adding X, then the base case could be dp[0][0] = 0. This approach looks at the possible ways of selecting elements to add X.

To calculate dp[i][j], consider the following: 
- If no element is added (i.e., j=0), then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]. 
- If one element is added, then it will be the maximum XOR value between the first i-1 elements and any of the last j elements. So, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] for k=0 to j) + xor(A[i], A[k]) where A[k] is an arbitrary element from the last j elements.

To find the maximum XOR value that can be obtained by adding X to at most one subsequence of the array A, we need to consider all possible combinations of adding X. This could be done by iterating over i and j and finding the maximum dp[i][j].

Finally, return the maximum value among all dp[N][j] for 0 <= j <= N.
