===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by considering all possible splits of the message and checking if each split satisfies the condition. However, this naive approach would lead to an exponential time complexity.

Instead, we can use dynamic programming with memoization to avoid counting the same splits multiple times.

Let dp[i][j] represent the number of ways to split s[0:i] into substrings with sum j and satisfying the condition. Then:

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k-1]*a[ord(s[k-1])-97] for k in range(j, i, -1)) if s[i-1:j].isalpha() and j-i+1<=max(a) else 0

The base case is when i == 0. In this case, dp[0][j] should return 1 if j == 0, otherwise it should return 0.

To find the number of ways to split s into substrings with sum n and satisfying the condition, we iterate over all possible sums from 1 to n and update dp[n][i].

Finally, we return dp[n][n] as the answer.

We can improve this plan by using a 2D array to store the dynamic programming state more efficiently. This would reduce the space complexity.

The potential issues with this plan are:

* It doesn't handle non-alphabetic characters in s.
* It assumes that a[1] to a[26] represent the maximum number of times each character in the English alphabet can appear consecutively in any substring of s.
* It doesn't handle edge cases, such as when n is 0 or s is an empty string.

To include edge cases, we should add conditions to check if n and s are valid inputs. For example, if n is 0, return 1 because there's only one way to split the message into substrings (i.e., not splitting it at all).
