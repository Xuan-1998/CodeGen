===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming to count the number of ways to split the message into substrings that satisfy the condition.

Let dp[i][j] represent the number of ways to split the substring s[i:j] into substrings that satisfy the condition. We can use the following recurrence relation:

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i][k] * dp[k+1][j] for k in range(i+1, j))

This is because a valid split of the substring s[i:j] must be the combination of valid splits of two substrings s[i:k] and s[k+1:j]. We can initialize dp[0][n-1] to 1 if it's possible to split the entire message into substrings that satisfy the condition, and 0 otherwise.

To find the length of the longest substring over all the ways and the minimum number of substrings over all the ways, we can maintain two additional arrays: max_length[i][j] and min_substrings[i][j]. We can use the following recurrence relations:

max_length[i][j] = max(max_length[i][k] + len(s[k:j]) for k in range(i+1, j))

min_substrings[i][j] = min(min_substrings[i][k] + 1 for k in range(i+1, j)) if any(dp[i][k] for k in range(i+1, j))

We can initialize max_length[0][n-1] to the length of the entire message and min_substrings[0][n-1] to 1.

Finally, we can return dp[0][n-1] as the number of ways to split the message into substrings that satisfy the condition, modulo 10^9 + 7. We can also return max_length[0][n-1] and min_substrings[0][n-1] as the length of the longest substring over all the ways and the minimum number of substrings over all the ways.
