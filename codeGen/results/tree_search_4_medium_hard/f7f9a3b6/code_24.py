===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize a dictionary dp where dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to split the substring s[i:j] into substrings that satisfy the condition.
2. Iterate over all possible splits of the message and check if each split satisfies the condition:
    - For each split, iterate over possible characters in the English alphabet.
    - Check if the number of times a character appears consecutively in any substring does not exceed a[i].
3. Memoize the results of subproblems using the dp dictionary to store the counts of valid splits for each substring.
4. To calculate dp[i][j], iterate over possible split points k in range(i, j) and check if:
    - dp[k+1][j] is true
    - s[i:k+1] is alphabetic and all characters are within max(a)
5. If both conditions are met, update dp[i][j]
6. Finally, return the count of valid splits for the entire message (s[0:n]) as the number of ways to split the message.
7. Calculate the length of the longest substring by iterating over possible splits and keeping track of the maximum length.
8. Calculate the minimum number of substrings by finding the smallest number of splits that satisfies the condition.
