===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem. Split the message into two parts, one containing only unique characters and another part with at most a[i] repeated occurrences of the same character. Count the number of ways to split the message in each part separately and then combine them.

Define the state as: dp[i][j] = number of ways to split the string s[0..i-1] into j substrings such that each substring has at most a[s[i-1]-1] repeated occurrences of the same character.

dp[i][j] = (k==1 and 1 or sum(dp[i-k][0]) for k in range(j+1)) * sum(a[ord(c)-1] for c in set(s[:i]).intersection(set('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[k-1])))
Implement a recursive approach using memoization, where the function calls itself with smaller indices and updated states until it reaches the base case, then combines the results to find the total number of ways to split the string.

To improve the plan, consider adding an optimization step to reduce the number of recursive calls. This could be done by sorting the characters in s and a and using this information to prune the search space.

The potential issues with the plan are that it may not be efficient due to the exponential time complexity of the recursive approach and it does not handle edge cases such as when n or any value in a is 0. It also assumes that all values in a are unique, which may not be the case.

To include edge cases, add checks at the beginning of the function to return 1 if n or any value in a is 0 and to return 0 if a contains duplicates. Also, handle the base case where j=1 by returning 1.
