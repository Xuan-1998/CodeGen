===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with memoization.

Let dp[i][j] be the number of ways to split the string s from position i to j such that each substring satisfies the condition. We initialize dp[0][n-1] to 1 because there is only one way to split the entire string (no splits at all).

The state transition relationship can be formulated as follows:

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k-1][i-1] * count(i, j, k) for k in range(i+1, j+1))

where count(i, j, k) is 1 if each substring from i to k satisfies the condition and 0 otherwise.

We use memoization to store previously computed values of dp[i][j] in a dictionary or hash map for faster lookup. This way, we avoid counting the same splits multiple times.

Finally, we return dp[0][n-1] as our answer.
