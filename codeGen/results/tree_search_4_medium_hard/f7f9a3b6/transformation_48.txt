===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the state as: dp[i][j] = maximum number of times s[0..i] can be split into j substrings such that each substring has at most a[s[i]-1] repeated occurrences of the same character.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[k-1][min(j, count(s[i-1], 0, i))) + 1 for k in range(1, j+1)) if s[i-1] appears only once in the current substring else dp[i-1][j]

Calculate the maximum number of times the message can be split into substrings using memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
