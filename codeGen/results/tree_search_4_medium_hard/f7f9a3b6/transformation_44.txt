===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem. Split the message into two parts, one containing only unique characters and another part with at most a[i] repeated occurrences of the same character. Count the number of ways to split the message in each part separately and then combine them.

Define the state as: dp[i][k] = maximum length of the k-th longest substring in all possible splits of s[0..i].

dp[i][j] = number of ways to split the first i characters into j substrings such that:
    - The length of the last substring is at most a[0]
    - The sum of lengths of all substrings is equal to i
    - dp[k][l] is known for 0 <= l < j

DP with two variables: Use a 2D array dp[i][k] where:
    - dp[i][k] represents the maximum length of the k-th longest substring in all possible splits of s[0..i]
    - Initialize dp[0][k] = 1 for 1 <= k <= 26 (base case: no substrings)

Update dp[i][k]:
    - If i < a[0], set dp[i][k] to the number of ways to split the first i characters into k substrings
    - Else, calculate the maximum length of the k-th longest substring in all possible splits of s[0..i-a[0]]
        + For each way to split the last a[0] characters, update dp[i][k]

Find the number of ways to split the message:
    - Initialize count = 1
    - For each i from 1 to n:
        + Calculate the maximum length of the k-th longest substring in all possible splits of s[0..i]
        + Update count by multiplying it with the number of ways to split the remaining characters

Calculate the minimum and maximum lengths of substrings:
    - Initialize min_len = n, max_len = 0
    - For each i from 1 to n:
        + Calculate the maximum length of the k-th longest substring in all possible splits of s[0..i]
        + Update min_len and max_len accordingly

Output:
    - The number of ways to split the message (modulo 10^9 + 7)
    - The maximum length of substrings
    - The minimum length of substrings
