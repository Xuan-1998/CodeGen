===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] = number of ways to split the string s[0..i-1] into j substrings such that each substring has at most a[s[i-1]-1] repeated occurrences of the same character.

Create a dictionary dp with default value 0 to store the intermediate results. Initialize it as dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(n+1)].

Then, for each character c in the string s:
    Update the values of dp[i][j] using the previous state dp[i-1][k] and the condition a[ord(c)-97].
        If c is unique, update dp[i][0] = 1
        Else, update dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k-1] * a[ord(c)-97] + k for k in range(1, i//a[ord(c)-97]+1))

For each j from n to 1:
    Update the number of ways to split s into j substrings: dp[n][j] = sum(dp[i][j-1] * (dp[n-i-1][0] if i < n else 0) for i in range(j))
Update the length of the longest substring and minimum number of substrings.
