===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem. Split the message into two parts: one containing only unique characters and another part with at most a[i] repeated occurrences of the same character. Count the number of ways to split the message in each part separately, then combine them.

Define the state as:
dp[i][j] = minimum number of substrings required to split s[0..i] into j substrings such that each substring has at most a[s[i-1]-1] repeated occurrences of the same character.
dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][l] + 1 for k in range(i) for l in range(26) if sum(s[m] == chr(m+96) for m in range(k, i)) <= a[ord(s[i-1])-97])
Implement memoization using recursive function calls and a dictionary to store intermediate results.

Consider the base case: dp[0][j] = 1 for all j (since there's only one way to split an empty string).

For each character in the message, update the dynamic programming table based on the previous characters. If the current character is unique or can be repeated at most a[s[i-1]-1] times, then we have two options:
- Continue with the same number of substrings.
- Start a new substring.

The time complexity will be O(n * 26) due to the nested loops and the space complexity will be O(n * 26) for storing intermediate results.
