===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by considering all possible splits of the message and checking if each split satisfies the condition. We can use dynamic programming to avoid counting the same splits multiple times.

dp[i][j] = 1 if there exists a split at position i such that each substring from i+1 to j satisfies the condition; 0 otherwise

The dynamic programming state can be defined as dp[i][j], which represents whether there exists a split at position i such that each substring from i+1 to j satisfies the condition.

We also need to memoize the function that calculates whether a given substring satisfies the condition. This is because we don't want to recalculate the same substrings multiple times, which can be done by storing the results of previously calculated substrings in a separate table or array.

The base case for our dynamic programming state dp[i][j] would be when j-i+1 equals 0 (no characters), then dp[i][j] is always true. This means we don't need to check any conditions because there are no characters to check.

When j-i+1 greater than or equal to 1, we need to check the condition of whether each substring from i+1 to j satisfies the given constraints. To do this, we can iterate over all possible splits at position i and calculate dp[i][j] for each split by checking if the characters from i+1 to j satisfy the conditions.

Finally, the number of ways to split the message into substrings that fulfill the conditions is the sum of all dp[i][n-1], where n is the length of the message. The longest substring and minimum number of substrings can be calculated similarly by iterating over all possible splits.

This plan seems correct, but it's always a good idea to double-check your logic for edge cases. For example, what if there are no characters in the message (n equals 0)? Or what if each character appears at most once (a[i] is 1 for all i from 1 to 26)?
