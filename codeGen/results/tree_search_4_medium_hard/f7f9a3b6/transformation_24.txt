===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by considering all possible splits of the message and checking if each split satisfies the condition. Use dynamic programming to avoid counting the same splits multiple times.

dp[i][j] = 1 if it's possible to split the substring s[i:j] into substrings that satisfy the condition, where:
    - dp[k+1][j] is true for some k in range(i, j)
    - s[i:j] is alphabetic and all characters are within max(a)

dp[i][j] = 0 otherwise

Memoize the results of subproblems using a dictionary to store the counts of valid splits for each substring. This will avoid repeated calculations.

To calculate dp[i][j], iterate over possible split points k in range(i, j) and check if:
    - dp[k+1][j] is true
    - s[i:k+1] is alphabetic and all characters are within max(a)
If both conditions are met, update dp[i][j]

Finally, return the count of valid splits for the entire message (s[0:n]) as the number of ways to split the message. Calculate the length of the longest substring by iterating over possible splits and keeping track of the maximum length. Calculate the minimum number of substrings by finding the smallest number of splits that satisfies the condition.
