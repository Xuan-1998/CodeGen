===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem. Split the message into two parts, one containing only unique characters and another part with at most a[i] repeated occurrences of the same character. Count the number of ways to split the message in each part separately and then combine them.

Define the state as: dp[i][j] = number of ways to split the string s[0..i-1] into j substrings such that each substring has at most a[s[i-1]-1] repeated occurrences of the same character.

dp[i][j] = sum((k==0 and 1 or dp[i-k][0]) * comb(i-k-1, a[ord(s[i-k-1])-97]-1) for k in range(1, i+1))

Split the message into two parts: one with unique characters and another part where each character appears at most a[i] times.

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + (s[i-1] is unique or s[i-1] appears at most a[ord(s[i-1])-97]-1 times) * dp[i-1-j][j]

To count the number of ways to split the message in each part, calculate the total number of unique characters and repeated occurrences.

For each character in the string, decide whether it's unique or appears at most a[i] times. 

If the current character is unique, increment j by 1; otherwise, decrement i by the maximum allowed repeated occurrences of the same character.

Finally, return dp[n][0].
