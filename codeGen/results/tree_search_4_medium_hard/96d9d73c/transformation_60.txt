===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the solution using a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.
Initialize a 2D array dp with dimensions N+1 and K+1, where dp[i][j] equals false for all i and j.
Set dp[0][0] to true, as it's always possible to partition an empty array into zero partitions.
Iterate over the array from left to right:
    For each element A[i]:
        Update dp[i][0] to false, as it's not possible to have a partition with zero elements.
        If A[i] > M, set dp[i][j] to false for all j, as no more partitions are possible after this point.
        Iterate over the array from left to right and update dp[i][k] based on the following rules:
            If there exists p such that all elements from 0 to p are less than or equal to M away from each other, 
                and the remaining elements (from p+1 to i-1) can be partitioned into k-1 partitions of size at least K, then set dp[i][k] to true.
            If there doesn't exist such a partition point p, then set dp[i][k] to false.
    Check if there exists j such that dp[N][j] equals true. 
        If yes, return true as it's possible to partition the array into j partitions.
    Otherwise, return false as it's not possible to partition the array.
