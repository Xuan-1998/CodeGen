===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.

dp[i][j] represents whether the jth partition has at least K elements.
Let dp[i][j] be true if A[0..i-1] can be partitioned into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M. Then, dp[i][j] is true iff for all k where 1 <= k <= i-1, the first k elements are in one partition, and the rest i-k elements also satisfy the same condition.

Initialize dp table as a 2D array with size (N+1) x (K+1), where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.

Base cases: 
dp[0][j] = true for all 0 <= j <= K (since we can always start a new partition)
dp[i][0] = false for all i > 0 (since we need at least one element in each partition)

Transition relation:
For all i, 1 <= i <= N, and all j, 1 <= j <= K,
dp[i][j] is true if and only if 
    - The maximum value in the first i-1 elements does not exceed M + K
    AND
    - For some k where 0 <= k < i, dp[k][j-1] is true (since we can partition the remaining i-k elements)

Return dp[N][K]
