===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization by maintaining a dictionary called memo where memo[(i, j, m)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions with maximum difference m.

Define the state as (i, k) where i is the current index and k is the number of partitions required, and the state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] with k partitions.

The key insight here is that we need not only check if it's possible to partition A[0..i-1] into k-1 partitions (which can be done by recursively calling memo[(i-1, k-1)]) but also ensure that the maximum difference between elements in the current partition is less than or equal to M.

Define a function dp(i, k) that returns True if it's possible to partition A[0..i] into k partitions and False otherwise. This can be done by iterating over all possible j (from 1 to min(k, i//k+1)) and checking if it's possible to partition A[0..j-1] into j-1 partitions with maximum difference M.

The function dp(i, k) should return True only if there exists a j such that memo[(j, k, m)] is True for all m in [A[j], A[i]], otherwise it returns False. This ensures that the absolute difference between any pair of elements in the same partition does not exceed M.

Finally, check if dp(N, K) is True to determine whether it's possible to partition the entire array into K partitions with maximum difference M.
