===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.

dp[i][j] equals True if there exists a valid partition for the subarray A[0..i-1], otherwise False.

Let's consider two cases:
1. The last element of the subarray is within [A[i-K], A[i+K]].
   In this case, we can try to partition the remaining elements into j-1 partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M. This can be done by checking dp[i-K][j-1].
2. The last element of the subarray is not within [A[i-K], A[i+K]].
   In this case, we need to try all possible values for the first partition. Let's say the size of the first partition is k (k >= K). Then, we can check if the remaining elements can be partitioned into j-1 partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M. This can be done by checking dp[i-k][j-1].

So, dp[i][j] = any(dp[i-K][j-1]) or (any(dp[i-k][j-1] for k in range(1, min(i+1, i-K+K+1))))

This plan considers all possible cases and edge cases.
