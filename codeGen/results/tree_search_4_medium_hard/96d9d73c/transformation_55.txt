===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the solution using a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.

dp[i][j] = (exists k in [0, i-K) such that 
        dp[k][j-1] and max(A[k:k+K])-min(A[k:k+K]) <= M
    ) or j == 1

Define a base case for j = 1: dp[0][1] = True (since it's always possible to partition the empty array into one partition)

Then fill in the rest of the table using dynamic programming principles:
- For each i, consider all possible values of k such that 0 <= k < i-K and dp[k][j-1]
- If any such k exists and max(A[k:k+K])-min(A[k:k+K]) <= M, then set dp[i][j] = True
- Otherwise, if j == 1 (base case), then set dp[i][j] = True
- Otherwise, set dp[i][j] = False

Finally, return dp[N][K]
