Tabulate the solution using a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.

dp[i][j] equals 1 if and only if there exists a partition point p such that all elements from 0 to p are less than or equal to M away from each other, and the remaining elements (from p+1 to i-1) can be partitioned into j-1 partitions of size at least K.

dp[i][j] equals max(dp[k][j-1] * (the number of ways to partition A[0..k-1] into j-1 partitions), dp[i-k][j-1]) for some 0 â‰¤ k < i, if and only if the elements from 0 to k are all less than or equal to M away from each other.

Precompute the prefix sums of the array and use them to speed up the calculation of dp[i][j].

Initialize a variable valid such that valid equals 1 if it is possible to partition A[0..i-1] into j partitions, and 0 otherwise. 

Iterate over all possible values of k from 0 to i-1.
Calculate the number of ways to partition A[0..k-1] into j-1 partitions using a dynamic programming approach with memoization.
Update dp[i][j] as max(dp[k][j-1] * (the number of ways to partition A[0..k-1] into j-1 partitions), dp[i-k][j-1]) if the elements from 0 to k are all less than or equal to M away from each other.
Update valid accordingly.

Return valid as the final answer.
