===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the solution using a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.

dp[i][j] equals 1 if and only if there exists a partition point p such that all elements from 0 to p are less than or equal to M away from each other, 
and the remaining elements (from p+1 to i-1) can be partitioned into j-1 partitions of size at least K.

Create a dp array with size (N+K+1) x (M+1), where 
dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, such that no two elements in the same partition are more than M apart. 

Fill the first row and column with 0, as it's not possible to partition an empty array or a single element.

For each i from 1 to N, 
for each j from 1 to min(i, K), 
dp[i][j] equals 1 if dp[k][j-1] * (the number of ways to partition A[0..k-1] into k partitions) for some 0 â‰¤ k < i is true, and the elements from 0 to k are all less than or equal to M away from each other. 

Return dp[N][K].
