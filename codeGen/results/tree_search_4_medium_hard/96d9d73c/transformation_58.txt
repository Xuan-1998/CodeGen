===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the solution using a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.

dp[i][j] = TRUE if:
    - It is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into (j-1) partitions
    - The maximum element in the last partition minus the minimum element does not exceed M

Update the dp array using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach:

for i from 1 to N:
    for j from K to min(K, i):
        if all elements in A[0..i-1] are within the range [A[i-K], A[i]]
            dp[i][j] = TRUE
        else:
            dp[i][j] = FALSE

Return dp[N][K]
