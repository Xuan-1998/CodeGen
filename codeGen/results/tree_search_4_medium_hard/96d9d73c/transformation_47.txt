===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization by maintaining a dictionary called memo where memo[(i, j)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.

Define the state as (i, j, M) where i is the current index, j is the number of partitions so far, and M is the maximum allowed difference between elements in the same partition. The state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] into j partitions with maximum difference M.

Maintain two arrays, one for whether each element can be part of its own partition (dp1) and another for whether the current partition has at least K elements (dp2).

Initialize dp1[i] = True for all i where 0 ≤ i < N. This is because initially, it's possible to put every element in its own partition.

For each i from 1 to N-1:

    Initialize dp2[i] = False for all j from 0 to K-1.
    For each j from 0 to K-1:
        If A[i] - M ≤ A[i-k] and dp1[i-k] is True, then set dp2[j] = True where k = min(j+1, i).
    
    Initialize memo[(i, 1)] = True. This means it's always possible to partition the array into one partition.

    For each j from 1 to K-1:
        If (dp2[j] is True and memo[(i-1, j-1)] is True) then set memo[(i, j)] = True.
    
    Return memo[(N-1, K-1)]
