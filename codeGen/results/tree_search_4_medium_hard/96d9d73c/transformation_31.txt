===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization by maintaining two dictionaries called memo1 and memo2 where 
memo1[(i, j)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i] into j partitions
and memo2[(i, j, k)] stores whether it's possible to partition the subarray A[0..i] into j partitions 
where the last element in each partition has value at most k.

Define the state as (i, j) where i is the current index and j is the number of partitions so far, 
and the state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] into j partitions.
Use dynamic programming to find the minimum index i such that for all 0 â‰¤ j < i, 
it is not possible to partition A[0..j] into j partitions according to the given condition.

To check if a partitioning of the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions is possible,
iterate over the array from left to right and whenever you see an element that does not fit
the current partition, increment the number of partitions. If at any point during this iteration 
you have more than j partitions, return false because it's impossible to partition A[0..i-1] into j partitions.
If all elements in the array are processed without exceeding j partitions, return true.

Use memoization by maintaining a dictionary called memo where 
memo[(i, j)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.
