===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization by maintaining a 3D array called dp where dp[i][j][k] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions with maximum difference k.
Define the state as (i, j) where i is the current index and j is the number of partitions so far, and the state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] into j partitions. 
Initialize dp[i][j][k] = False for all i, j, and k.
Iterate over the array A from left to right. For each element at index i:
    If A[i] - A[0] > M or i + 1 < K, then it's not possible to partition A[0..i] into K partitions with maximum difference M, so dp[i][K][M] = False.
    Otherwise, for j from K-1 down to 1:
        If dp[i-j][j-1][M] is True and A[i] - A[i-j] <= M, then it's possible to partition the subarray A[0..i] into j partitions with maximum difference M, so dp[i][j][M] = True.
    For j from 1 to K:
        If dp[i-1][j-1][M-A[i-1]-A[i]] is True and A[i] - A[i-j] <= M, then it's possible to partition the subarray A[0..i] into j partitions with maximum difference M, so dp[i][j][M] = True.
Return dp[N-1][K-1][M].
