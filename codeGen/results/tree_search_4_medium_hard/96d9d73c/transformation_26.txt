===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the dynamic programming table as a 3D array dp[i][j][k] where dp[i][j][k] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M, such that the maximum value in any partition does not exceed k.
dp[i][j][k] represents whether the jth partition has at least K elements. Let dp[i][j][k] be true if A[0..i-1] can be partitioned into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M, such that the maximum value in any partition does not exceed k.
Then, dp[i][j][k] is true iff for all l where 1 <= l <= i-1, the first l elements are in one partition, and the rest i-l elements also satisfy the same condition, with a maximum value not exceeding k + M.
Implement tabulation by iterating over all possible i, j, and k values and filling up the dp table accordingly. Initialize dp[0][j][k] to be false for all j and k, since an empty array cannot be partitioned into any number of partitions. Initialize dp[i][0][k] to be true if A[0..i-1] can be partitioned into one partition with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M, such that the maximum value does not exceed k.
Finally, check whether dp[N][K][M] is true. If it is, return true; otherwise, return false.
