===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization by maintaining a dictionary called memo where memo[(i, j)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.

Define the state as (i, j) where i is the current index and j is the number of partitions so far. The state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] into j partitions.
Use a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is true if it's possible to partition the subarray A[0..i] into j partitions.

Define dp as a 2D array where dp[i][j] is true if it's possible to partition the subarray A[0..i] into j partitions and use tabulation by filling up the dp array from top to bottom.
For each i, check for all j in [K, N], whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j-1 partitions. If it is possible, then it's also possible to partition the subarray A[0..i] into j partitions with maximum difference M.
