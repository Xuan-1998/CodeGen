Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.

dp[i][j] is true if there exists a partition point p such that 0 ≤ p ≤ i, A[p-1]-M ≤ A[i-1] ≤ A[p-1]+M, dp[p][j-1] is true, and the remaining elements in subarray A[0..p-2] can be partitioned into j-1 partitions.

Initialize the base cases: dp[0][0] = True, as an empty array can always be partitioned into 0 partitions. dp[i][0] = False for i > 0, as a non-empty array cannot be partitioned into 0 partitions.
dp[0][j] = False for j > 0, as the empty array cannot be partitioned into more than 0 partitions.

Fill in the dp table using bottom-up dynamic programming: for each i from 1 to N and j from 1 to min(i, K), check if there exists a p such that 0 ≤ p ≤ i, A[p-1]-M ≤ A[i-1] ≤ A[p-1]+M, and dp[p][j-1] is true. If such a p exists, then dp[i][j] should be True; otherwise, it should be False.

The final answer is dp[N][K].
