Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[i][j] where:
    - dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.
    - For i = 0, dp[i][j] equals True for all j (base case)
    - For i > 0:
        - dp[i][j] equals False if there is no valid partition for the subarray A[0..i-1]
        - If there exists a valid partition for the subarray A[0..i-1], then consider extending each of the j partitions
            + Check if the current element A[i] can be added to one of the existing partitions without violating the rules (absolute difference not exceeding M)
                - If it can, update dp[i][j] to True
                - If not, check if a new partition with at least K elements can be started from the current element and update dp[i][j] accordingly
        - If no valid partition is found for any j, set dp[i][j] to False

The final answer will be stored in dp[N][K+1]. If it equals True, then it's possible to partition the array according to the given rules; otherwise, it's not.
