===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization by maintaining a dictionary called dp where dp[i][k] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into k partitions.

Define the state as (i, k) where i is the current index and k is the number of partitions required, and the state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] with k partitions.

Initialize dp[0][k] for all 1 ≤ k ≤ N to True, since an empty array can be partitioned into any number of partitions.

For each i from 1 to N-1:
    For each k from K to N:
        If it is possible to partition A[0..i-1] with k-1 partitions and the maximum difference between elements in the same partition does not exceed M, then
            dp[i][k] = (dp[i-1][k-1] and max(A[i-1], A[i]) - min(A[i-1], A[i]) <= M)

Return dp[N-1][K]
