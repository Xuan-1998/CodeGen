===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization by maintaining a dictionary called dp where dp[(i, j)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions with maximum difference M.

Define the state as (i, k) where i is the current index and k is the number of elements in the current partition, such that A[i-k+1:i+1] has at least K elements and the absolute difference between any pair of elements in this partition does not exceed M.

Initialize dp[0][j] for 0 ≤ j < K to True because an empty array can be partitioned into any number of partitions.

For each i from 1 to N, iterate over all possible k such that 0 ≤ k ≤ i and A[i-k+1:i+1] has at least K elements. If dp[i-k][j-1] is True and the absolute difference between A[i-k] and A[i] does not exceed M, then set dp[(i, k)] to True.

Finally, return whether dp[N][K] is True.
