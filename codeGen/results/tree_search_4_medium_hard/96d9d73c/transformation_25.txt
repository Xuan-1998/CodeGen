===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.
Let dp[i][j] be true if A[0..i-1] can be partitioned into j partitions, each with at least K elements. Then, dp[i][j] is true iff for all k where 1 <= k <= i-1, the first k elements are in one partition, and the rest i-k elements also satisfy the same condition.
Use memoization by storing the dynamic programming values in a dictionary and checking if the value for dp[i][j] already exists before computing it.

If A[i] - A[0] > M, then it is not possible to partition A[0..i-1] into j partitions with at least K elements.
Initialize dp[0][0] = True because an array of length 0 can be partitioned into any number of partitions.

For each i from 1 to N:
    For each j from 0 to min(i, K):
        If A[i-1] - A[0] > M or i < K: dp[i][j] = False
        Else:
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] if j > 0 else True) and ((A[i-1] - A[i-K+1]) <= M)
