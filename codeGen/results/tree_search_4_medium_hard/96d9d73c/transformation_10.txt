===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.
dp[i][j] equals True if there exists a valid partition for the subarray A[0..i-1], otherwise False.
For all i > 0, dp[i][0] = False because it's impossible to have only one partition.
Initialize the base case: dp[0][0] = True because an empty array can be considered as being in a single partition.
For each i from 1 to N-1 and each j from 1 to min(i, K), dp[i][j] is True if:
    - The last element of A[0..i-1] is less than or equal to the maximum value of the previous j-1 partitions (maxprev) + M, where maxprev is the maximum value in the previous j-1 partitions.
    - There exists a valid partition for the subarray A[0..i-2], which can be split into j-1 partitions and the last element is appended to one of these partitions.
dp[i][j] equals False if any of the above conditions are not met.
For all i > 0, dp[i][K] = True because it's always possible to have at least K elements in each partition, even if they're all equal.
Return dp[N-1][K].
