===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, considering only elements up to index i-1.

dp[i][j] = (A[i]-A[i-1]) <= M and dp[i-1][min(j-1, ceil((i-1)/M)+1)]

Tabulate the solution by using dynamic programming with a time complexity of O(N*M) and space complexity of O(N*M).

Initialize dp[0][j] for all j to true.

For each i from 1 to N:
    For each j from 1 to min(i/M+1, K):
        if (A[i-1]-A[i-2]) > M or i < K:
            dp[i][j] = false
        else:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][min(j-1, ceil((i-1)/M)+1)]

Return dp[N][K]
