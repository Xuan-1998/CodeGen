===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.
dp[i][j] equals True if there exists a valid partition for the subarray A[0..i-1], otherwise False.
dp[i][j] is True if it is possible to extend a valid partition of the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.

For i = 0 to N-1: 
    For j = 1 to ceil((i+K-1)/K): 
        dp[i][j] = (dp[i-K+1][j-1] and A[i-K]-M <= A[i-1] <= A[i-K]+M) or
                   (i < K and j == 1)
    end for
end for

Return dp[N-1][any positive integer that satisfies the condition]
