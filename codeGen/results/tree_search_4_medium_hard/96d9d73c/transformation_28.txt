===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization by maintaining a dictionary called memo where memo[(i, j)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.

Define the state as (i, j) where i is the current index and j is the number of partitions so far, and the state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] into j partitions.
Memoize whether a subarray ending at index i can be partitioned into j partitions using the condition that each partition has at least K elements and absolute difference between any pair of elements in the same partition does not exceed M.

Define the state as dp[i] where i is the current index and the state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] into at least K partitions.
Initialize dp[0] = True, since an empty array can be partitioned into at least K partitions (all of them are empty).

For each index i from 1 to N-1:
    For each partition j from 1 to min(i+1, K):
        If the subarray A[0..i-1] can be partitioned into j-1 partitions and the current element A[i] is within M of all elements in the last partition (check using a sliding window approach), then it's possible to partition A[0..i] into j partitions.
        Update dp[i] = True if possible, False otherwise.

Return dp[N-1].
