===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.

dp[i][j] = (A[i-1] - A[0]) % (M+1) <= 0 && dp[i-1][j]
This line is missing in your original plan. This condition checks if the current partition's maximum element does not exceed the minimum element of the previous partition by more than M.

Let dp[i][j] be true if A[0..i-1] can be partitioned into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M. Then, dp[i][j] is true iff there exists a partition point k such that 1 <= k <= i-1, the first k elements are in one partition, and the rest i-k elements are also in one partition.

Create a dynamic programming table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.
