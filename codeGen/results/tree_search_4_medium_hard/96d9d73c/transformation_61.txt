===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the solution using a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.
dp[i][j] equals 1 if and only if there exists a partition point p such that all elements from 0 to p are less than or equal to M away from each other, 
and the remaining elements (from p+1 to i-1) can be partitioned into j-1 partitions of size at least K.
We need to handle edge cases: dp[0][j] should be 1 for all j because an empty subarray can always be partitioned into any number of partitions. 
dp[i][0] should be 0 for all i because a subarray cannot be partitioned into zero partitions.

To implement memoization, define a function f(i, j) that returns 1 if it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, and 0 otherwise. 
Use a dictionary or cache to store previously computed values of f(i, j), so as to avoid redundant computation.

Initialize dp with base cases: for i from 0 to N-1, set dp[i][0] = 1 and dp[i][j] = 0 for all j > 0.
For each i from K to N-1, calculate dp[i][j] based on the previously computed values of f(i, j) and store them in the cache.

Finally, return f(N, K).
