===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization by maintaining a dictionary called memo where memo[(i, j)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.

Define the state as (i, k) where i is the current index and k is the number of partitions required, and the state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] with k partitions. The dynamic programming recurrence relation would be:
dp[i][k] = dp[i-1][k] or dp[i-1][k-1] and |A[i]-A[i-k]| <= M

Maintain two states: (i, k) and (i, m), where the first state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] with k partitions, and the second state represents whether it's possible to maintain a maximum difference of m in the subarray A[0..i].

Use a top-down approach by recursively calculating dp[i][k] based on dp[i-1][k] and dp[i-1][k-1]. If it's not possible to partition, then return false.

Update memo[(i, k)] with the calculated value of dp[i][k].

Return dp[N][K]
