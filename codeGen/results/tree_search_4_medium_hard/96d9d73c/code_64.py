===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.
dp[i][j] = 1 if there exists a partition point p such that:
    - All elements from 0 to p are <= M away from each other
    - The remaining elements (from p+1 to i-1) can be partitioned into j-1 partitions of size at least K

dp[i][j] = dp[k][j-1] * (# ways to partition A[0..k-1] into k partitions)
              for some 0 <= k < i
              if the elements from 0 to k are all <= M away from each other

Use memoization by storing intermediate results in a dictionary:
    - key: (i, j)
    - value: 1 if condition holds true, or 0 otherwise

Maintain an additional array, prev[i], to keep track of the maximum element seen so far.

Update the plan as follows:

* Initialize dp and prev arrays with zeros.
* Iterate over the array A:
    - Update dp[i][j] based on previous values and the current maximum element seen so far.
* For each i, iterate from j = K to 1:
    - Update dp[i][j] if the condition holds true.
* Return dp[N][K] as the result.

This plan correctly addresses edge cases such as N = 0 or K = 0. The use of memoization helps reduce computational complexity by avoiding redundant calculations.

Here's the Python code to implement this approach:
