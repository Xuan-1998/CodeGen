===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.

dp[i][j] represents whether the jth partition has at least K elements.
Let dp[i][j] be true if A[0..i-1] can be partitioned into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M. Then, dp[i][j] is true iff there exists a partition point k such that 1 <= k <= i-1, the first k elements are in one partition, the rest i-k elements can also be partitioned into another j-1 partitions.

Fill dp[i][j] based on whether A[0..i-1] can be partitioned into j partitions with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M, considering all possible i and j. For each i from 1 to N, for each j from 1 to min(i/K, (M+1)/M), if the maximum element in A[0..i-1] minus the minimum element is less than or equal to M, then dp[i][j] = true; else dp[i][j] = false.
