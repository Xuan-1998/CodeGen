===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization by maintaining a dictionary called memo where memo[(i, j)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.
Define the state as (i, k, m) where i is the current index, k is the number of partitions required, and m is the maximum allowed difference between elements in the same partition, and the state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] with k partitions and maximum difference m.
Maintain two states: (i, k) and (i, m), where the first state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] with k partitions, and the second state represents whether it's possible to maintain a maximum difference of m in the subarray A[0..i].
Implement tabulation using a 3D array dp where dp[i][k][m] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into k partitions with maximum difference m.
For each element at index i, check if it's possible to partition the previous subarray A[0..i-1] into k-1 or k partitions with maximum difference m. If possible, update dp[i][k][m].
Use the following base cases: 
- dp[0][k][m] is always false for k > 0 and true for k = 0.
- dp[i][0][m] is always true if A[i] <= M + max(A[:i]).
- dp[i][k][0] is always true if i >= K - 1.
