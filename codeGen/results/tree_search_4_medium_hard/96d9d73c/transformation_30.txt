===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization by maintaining a dictionary called memo where memo[(i, j)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.
Define the state as (i, j) where i is the current index and j is the number of partitions so far, and the state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] into j partitions.
Initialize memo[(0, 0)] to True because an empty array can be partitioned into zero partitions.
For each index i from 1 to N-1:
    For each number of partitions j from 1 to min(i, K):
        If it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j-1 partitions (memo[(i-1, j-1)]) and the absolute difference between the maximum element in A[0..i-1] and the minimum element in A[i] does not exceed M:
            memo[(i, j)] = True
        Else:
            memo[(i, j)] = False
Return memo[(N-1, K)]
Maintain a dictionary called dp where dp[i][j] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i] into j partitions.
For each index i from 0 to N-1:
    For each number of partitions j from 0 to min(i+1, K):
        If it's possible to partition the subarray A[0..i] into j partitions (dp[i][j]) and the absolute difference between the maximum element in A[0..i] and the minimum element in A[i+1] does not exceed M:
            dp[i+1][j+1] = True
        Else:
            dp[i+1][j+1] = False
Return dp[N-1][K]
