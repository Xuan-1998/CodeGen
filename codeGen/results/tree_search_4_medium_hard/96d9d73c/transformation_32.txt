===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization by maintaining a dictionary called memo where memo[(i, j)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.

Define the state as (i, j) where i is the current index and j is the number of partitions so far, and the state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] into j partitions.

Use dynamic programming to find the minimum index i such that for all 0 â‰¤ j < i, it is not possible to partition A[0..j] into j partitions according to the given condition.

Define the state as dp[i][j] where i is the current index and j is the number of partitions so far, and the state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] into j partitions.

Initialize a variable called 'result' which will store the minimum index i. Initialize dp with all values set to False.

For each element in array A:
    For each number of partitions j from K to 1 (inclusive):
        If A[i] is less than or equal to M and it's possible to partition subarray A[0..i-1] into j-1 partitions, then it's possible to partition subarray A[0..i] into j partitions.
        Set dp[i][j] to True.

    For each number of partitions j from K to 1 (inclusive):
        If dp[i][j] is True:
            Update the 'result' variable with i as it's the first index where we can partition array A into at least K partitions.
            Break out of the inner loop.

Return result.
