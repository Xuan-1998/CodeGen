===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization by maintaining a dictionary called memo where memo[(i, j)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.

Define the state as (i, k, m) where i is the current index, k is the number of partitions required, and m is the maximum allowed difference between elements in the same partition, and the state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] with k partitions and maximum difference m.

Maintain two states: (i, k) and (i, m), where the first state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] with k partitions, and the second state represents whether it's possible to maintain a maximum difference of m in the subarray A[0..i].

Use dictionary memo where memo[(i, j)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.

Initialize memo as an empty dictionary.

For each i from 1 to N:
    For each k from K to N:
        Initialize a variable dp[i][k] as false.
        For each m from 1 to M:
            If it's possible to partition A[0..i-1] into k-1 partitions with maximum difference m, and the last element in that partition is A[i-1], then
                dp[i][k] = True

    Return dp[N][K]
