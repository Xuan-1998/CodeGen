===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization by maintaining two dictionaries called memo and dp where 
memo[(i, j)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions
dp[(i, j)] is true if it's possible to partition the subarray A[0..i] into j partitions.

Define the state as (i, j, M) where i is the current index, j is the number of partitions so far, and M is the maximum allowed difference between elements in the same partition.
The state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] into j partitions with maximum difference M.

Maintain a dictionary dp where dp[(i, j)] is true if it's possible to partition the subarray A[0..i] into j partitions.
Maintain another 2D array same as dp, but store its complement i.e., (not dp[i][j]) for easier lookup.

For each state (i, j, M), check two possibilities: 
1. If it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j-1 partitions with maximum difference M, then consider adding an element at index i.
2. If it's not possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions with maximum difference M, then consider reducing the number of partitions by 1.

Return dp[(N, K)] as the final answer which represents whether it is possible to partition the array A into K partitions.
