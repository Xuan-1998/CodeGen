===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.

Let's start by initializing the base cases:
dp[0][0] = True // since an empty array can be partitioned into 0 partitions
for i from 1 to N:
    dp[i][0] = False // it is impossible to partition a single-element array

Now, let's fill in the dp table using the following recurrence relation:
dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] and A[i-1]-A[i-K+1] <= M) or (exists k such that 0 < k <= i-K and dp[k][j-1])

This means it's possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions if either:
- The last K elements can be included in the current partition without exceeding M, and it's possible to partition the remaining subarray into j-1 partitions
- There exists a partition point k such that 0 < k <= i-K, and it's possible to partition the subarray A[0..k-1] into j-1 partitions

Finally, check if dp[N][j] is True for some j >= K. If so, return True; otherwise, return False.
