Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[N+1][K+1] where dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.
Create an array prev[K+1] of size K+1 to store the maximum element in the previous partition.
Fill up the dp table in a bottom-up manner. For any cell dp[i][j], it's possible if and only if there exists a number k such that:
    - k is a valid partition (i.e., A[i-1] - M <= prev[k] && prev[k] + M >= A[0..i-2].max)
    - The remaining subarray A[0..i-k-1] can be partitioned into j-1 partitions.
Initialize the base case dp[0][j] to true for all j, as it's always possible to create an empty array.
Iterate through the array and fill up the dp table. For each cell, check if there exists a valid k such that:
    - A[i-1] - M <= prev[k] && prev[k] + M >= max(A[0..i-k-2])
    - The remaining subarray A[0..i-k-1] can be partitioned into j-1 partitions.
Update the dp table accordingly and store the maximum element in the current partition in prev[k].
Return dp[N][K] as the final result, indicating whether it's possible to partition the array according to the given rules.
