===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the solution using a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.

dp[i][j] equals 1 if and only if there exists a partition point p such that all elements from 0 to p are less than or equal to M away from each other, and the remaining elements (from p+1 to i-1) can be partitioned into j-1 partitions of size at least K.

dp[i][j] equals dp[k][j-1] * (the number of ways to partition A[0..k-1] into k partitions) for some 0 â‰¤ k < i, if and only if the elements from 0 to k are all less than or equal to M away from each other.

Implement dynamic programming using nested loops to fill up the dp array, with outer loop running from i=1 to N and inner loop running from j=1 to min(K, i).
