===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.

dp[i][j] is true if there exists a partition point p such that 0 ≤ p ≤ i, A[p-1]-M ≤ A[i-1] ≤ A[p-1]+M, dp[p][j-1] is true, and the remaining elements in subarray A[0..p-2] can be partitioned into j-1 partitions.

For each cell dp[i][0], set it to false because we cannot have zero partitions.

Use nested loops to fill up the dp table in bottom-up manner, starting from small values of i and j. For each cell dp[i][j], check if there exists a p such that 0 ≤ p ≤ i, A[p-1]-M ≤ A[i-1] ≤ A[p-1]+M, and dp[p][j-1] is true.

If found, set dp[i][j] to true; otherwise, set it to false.

Finally, check if dp[N][K] is true. If it is, then we can partition the array into K partitions with each having at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.

If it's not, then we cannot do so.
