===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the solution using a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.

dp[i][j] = (A[i] <= max(A[i-K:i])) and (A[i] >= min(A[i-K:i])) and (dp[i-K][j] or dp[i-K][j-1])
Use a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.

If i < K, then dp[i][j] = False for all j > 1

Return dp[N][K]
