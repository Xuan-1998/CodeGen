===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.
dp[i][j] equals True if there exists a valid partition for the subarray A[0..i-1], otherwise False.
For i from 1 to N:
    For j from 1 to min(K, i):
        If dp[i-1][j-1] is True and A[i-1] - A[i-k+1] <= M, then set dp[i][j] = True; 
        else if j == 1, set dp[i][j] = True;
        otherwise, set dp[i][j] = False.
