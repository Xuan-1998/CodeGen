===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.

dp[i][j] represents whether the jth partition has at least K elements.

Let dp[i][j] be true if A[0..i-1] can be partitioned into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M. Then, dp[i][j] is true iff there exists a partition point k such that 1 <= k <= i-1, the first k elements are in one partition, and the rest i-k elements are also in one partition.

Use memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

For each i from K to N, for each j from 1 to i//K (since the maximum number of partitions is i//K), check if it's possible to partition the first i elements into j partitions such that each partition has at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M. If it's possible, set dp[i][j] to True.

Finally, check if there exists a j such that dp[N][j] is True. If it is, then it's possible to partition the array A into j partitions satisfying the given conditions. Otherwise, return False.
