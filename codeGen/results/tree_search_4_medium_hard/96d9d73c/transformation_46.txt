===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization by maintaining a dictionary called memo where memo[(i, j)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.

Define the state as (i, j, M) where i is the current index, j is the number of partitions so far, and M is the maximum allowed difference between elements in the same partition. The state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] into j partitions with maximum difference M.

Maintain two arrays: one for whether each element can be part of its own partition (dp1), and another for whether the current partition has at least K elements (dp2).

Initialize dp1[i] and dp2[i] as False, because initially no element can be part of its own partition and no partition has at least K elements.

Maintain a set of elements that can be part of their own partition (canBePartitioned) and update this set for each element. Then check if there are at least K elements in the set.

For each i from 1 to N:
    If dp2[i-1] is True, then it's possible to partition A[0..i-1] into j partitions with maximum difference M.
    For each j from 1 to min(i, K):
        Calculate the minimum and maximum values in the current partition (minPartitionValue, maxPartitionValue).
        If maxPartitionValue - minPartitionValue <= M:
            memo[(i, j)] = True
        else:
            memo[(i, j)] = False

Return memo[(N, K)]
