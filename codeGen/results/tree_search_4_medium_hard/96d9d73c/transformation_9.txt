===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[N+1][K+1] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.
dp[i][j] equals True if there exists a valid partition for the subarray A[0..i-1], otherwise False.

Initially, set dp[0][j] to False for all 0 <= j <= K, since it is impossible to partition an empty array into any number of partitions. Also, set dp[i][0] to True for all 1 <= i <= N, since it is always possible to partition the array into no partitions.

For 1 <= i <= N and 1 <= j <= K, calculate dp[i][j] as follows:
- If A[i-1] - M >= K, then set dp[i][j] to dp[i-1][j], since we can safely include the current element in one of the partitions.
- Else if A[i-1] + M < K, then set dp[i][j] to False, since we cannot include the current element in any partition without violating the absolute difference constraint.
- Otherwise, calculate the minimum and maximum possible values for the current element that would still satisfy the constraints. Let's call these values min_val and max_val.
  - If min_val >= K, then set dp[i][j] to dp[i-1][j], since we can safely include the current element in one of the partitions.
  - Else if max_val < K, then set dp[i][j] to False, since we cannot include the current element in any partition without violating the absolute difference constraint.
  - Otherwise, calculate the number of valid partitions for the subarray A[0..i-1] that have at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M. If this number is less than or equal to j, then set dp[i][j] to True; otherwise, set dp[i][j] to False.

Finally, return dp[N][K].
