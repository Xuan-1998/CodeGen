===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.

dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M. This can be calculated by iterating through the array from left to right and considering all possible partition points p such that 0 ≤ p ≤ i, A[p-1]-M ≤ A[i-1] ≤ A[p-1]+M.

Initialize dp[0][j] as false for all j, and dp[i][0] as true for all i. This represents the base case where we can always partition an empty array or a single element array into 0 partitions.

Update the plan as follows:
For each i from 1 to N-1:
    For each j from K to min(i, K):
        If A[i-1]-M ≤ A[0] ≤ A[i-1]+M and dp[i-1][j] is true, then set dp[i][j] as true.
    Else, set dp[i][K-1] as true.

Return dp[N-1][K]. This represents the answer to the problem: whether it is possible to partition the array into K partitions with at least K elements each and absolute difference not exceeding M.
