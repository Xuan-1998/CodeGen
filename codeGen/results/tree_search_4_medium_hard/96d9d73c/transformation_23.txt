===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.

dp[i][j] represents whether the jth partition has at least K elements.
Let dp[i][j] be true if A[0..i-1] can be partitioned into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M. Then, dp[i][j] is true iff there exists a partition point k such that 1 <= k <= i-1, the first k elements are in one partition, the rest i-k elements can also be partitioned into another j-1 partitions.

Dynamically compute dp[i][j] based on the previous subproblems dp[k][j-1] and dp[i-k][j], considering all possible k where 0 <= k < i. For each k, check if the absolute difference between A[k-1] and A[0..k-2] (if exists) does not exceed M. If it does not, set dp[i][j] as true.

For j = 1, set dp[i][j] as true if A[0..i-1] has at least K elements.
For j = N (where N is the size of the array), set all dp[i][N] to false since it's not possible to partition an array into more partitions than its size.
