===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization by maintaining two dictionaries: memo and dp.

memo[(i, j)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, where i is the current index and j is the number of partitions so far.
dp[i] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1].

Define a state as (i, j) where i is the current index and j is the number of partitions so far. This state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] into j partitions.

Memoize by using dp and memo:

* If it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j-1 partitions, and the last element in that partitioning is not more than M away from the first element of the next partition, then memo[(i, j)] = True.
* If it's possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-K+1] into j-1 partitions, and each partition has at least K elements, then memo[(i, j)] = True.

Use the base case that if i < K, then memo[(i, 1)] = True.
Finally, return dp[N]. This will give us whether it's possible to partition A[0..N] into any number of partitions.
