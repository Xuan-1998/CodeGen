===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.

dp[i][j] equals True if there exists a valid partition for the subarray A[0..i-1], otherwise False.
dp[i][j] is True if it is possible to extend a valid partition of the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.

dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] and |A[i]-A[i-K]| <= M) or ((exists valid partition for subarray A[0..i-K], with at least j-1 partitions) and (max element in the last partition is less than or equal to A[i-1]))

For initialization, dp[0][j] = False for all j > 0.
dp[0][0] = True.

For each i from 1 to N, for each j from 0 to min(i, K), calculate dp[i][j].
