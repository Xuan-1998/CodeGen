===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.
dp[i][j] equals True if there exists a valid partition for the subarray A[0..i-1], otherwise False.
Let's sort the array A in ascending order. This is to ensure that we can consider all possible partitions efficiently.
dp[i][j] = (all(dp[k][j-1] for k in range(max(0, i-K*(j-1)), min(i, j*K))))
This condition checks if it's possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions. The inner loop ensures that each partition has at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.
