Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.

The base case is when i = K or j = 1. In this case, it's always possible to partition the array into one partition (j = 1) or K elements (i = K).

For larger i and j, use a bottom-up approach to fill dp[i][j]. 

Let dp[i][j] be true if A[0..i-1] can be partitioned into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M. Then, dp[i][j] is true iff there exists a partition point k such that 1 <= k <= i-1, the first k elements are in one partition, the rest i-k elements can also be partitioned into another j-1 partitions.

Start by initializing all dp[i][0] and dp[0][j] to false, since it's not possible to have no elements or zero partitions.

Then, for each 1 <= i <= N and 1 <= j <= M:
    - If the difference between A[i-1] and A[i-K+1] is less than or equal to M, then dp[i][j] can be true if the previous partition (i-K+1) can be divided into j-1 partitions. 
    - Otherwise, dp[i][j] should be false.
