===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization by maintaining a dictionary called memo where memo[(i, j)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.

Define the state as (i, j) where i is the current index and j is the number of partitions so far, and use memoization to store whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] into j partitions based on the condition that each partition has at least K elements and absolute difference between any pair of elements in the same partition does not exceed M.

Maintain a dictionary called memo where memo[(i, j)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions. If memo[(i, j)] is True, then we can partition A[0..i] into j+1 partitions by adding the current element to one of the existing partitions if its absolute difference with any element in that partition does not exceed M.

Base case: for i = 0 and 0 â‰¤ j < K, memo[(i, j)] should be False because we cannot partition an empty array into more than zero partitions.

Transition from state (i-1, j) to state (i, j+1): if it is possible to partition A[0..i-1] into j partitions and the current element can be added to one of those partitions without violating the condition, then memo[(i, j+1)] should be True.

Transition from state (i-1, K) to state (i, 1): if it is possible to partition A[0..i-1] into K partitions and the current element can start a new partition with at least K elements without violating the condition, then memo[(i, 1)] should be True.

Transition from state (i-1, j) to state (i, j): if it is not possible to partition A[0..i-1] into j partitions or adding the current element to any of those partitions would violate the condition, then memo[(i, j)] should be False.

To determine whether it's possible to partition the entire array A[0..N-1] into K partitions, we check if memo[(N-1, K)] is True. If so, return True; otherwise, return False.
