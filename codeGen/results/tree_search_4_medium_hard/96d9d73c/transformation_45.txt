===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization by maintaining a dictionary called memo where memo[(i, j)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.

Define the state as (i, j) where i is the current index and j is the number of partitions so far. The state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] into j partitions.

Maintain a dictionary called dp where dp[i][j] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i] into j partitions.
Let dp[0][0] be True and dp[0][j] be False for all j > 0. This represents that we can't partition an empty array.

For each element i in A:

    If i is less than or equal to K:
        For each possible number of partitions j:
            If it's possible to partition the previous elements into j-1 partitions and the current element fits within the maximum difference M, then mark dp[i][j] as True.
            Otherwise, mark dp[i][j] as False.

    Else:
        For each possible number of partitions j:
            If it's not possible to fit this element in any existing partition (i.e., the elements are more than M apart) and we need at least K elements in a partition, then mark dp[i][j] as True.
            Otherwise, mark dp[i][j] as False.

Finally, check if it's possible to partition the entire array into j partitions for some j. If so, return True; otherwise, return False.
