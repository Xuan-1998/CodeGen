===BEGIN PLAN===
Use memoization by maintaining a dictionary called memo where memo[(i, j)] stores whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.

Define the state as (i, j) where i is the current index, and j is the number of partitions so far. The state represents whether it's possible to partition A[0..i] into j partitions.

Use a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is true if it's possible to partition the subarray A[0..i] into j partitions.

Use a recursive function with memoization to store whether it's possible to partition the subarray A[0..i] into j partitions. If dp[i][j] is false, return false as well. Otherwise, iterate over all elements in A[0..i] and check if it's possible to partition A[0..k] into j-1 partitions for each k.

If it's possible to partition A[0..k] into j-1 partitions, update dp[i][j] accordingly and return true. If not, return false.

Finally, use a loop to iterate over all elements in the array and check if it's possible to partition the entire array into K partitions. If so, return True; otherwise, return False.
