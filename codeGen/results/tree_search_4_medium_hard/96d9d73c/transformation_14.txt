===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the dynamic programming table as a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions, each with at least K elements and absolute difference not exceeding M.
dp[i][j] equals True if there exists a valid partition for the subarray A[0..i-1], otherwise False.
The plan seems correct so far. However, we should also consider the base case where i < K. In this case, it's impossible to partition the array into j partitions with at least K elements each.

dp[i][j] is True if there exists a valid partition for the subarray A[0..i-1] where all elements in this partition are within [A[0], A[K]]
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] or (A[i] - M <= dp[i-1][int((i-K)/M)+1] and A[i] + M >= dp[i-1][int((i+K)/M)+1])
