===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulate the solution using a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to partition the subarray A[0..i-1] into j partitions.

dp[i][j] equals 1 if and only if there exists a partition point p such that all elements from 0 to p are less than or equal to M away from each other, and the remaining elements (from p+1 to i-1) can be partitioned into j-1 partitions of size at least K.

dp[i][j] equals dp[k][j-1] * (the number of ways to partition A[0..k-1] into k partitions) for some 0 â‰¤ k < i, if and only if the elements from 0 to k are all less than or equal to M away from each other.

Use memoization by storing the intermediate results in a dictionary, where the key is the tuple (i, j) and the value is 1 if the condition holds true, or 0 otherwise.

Maintain an additional array, prev[i], to keep track of the maximum element seen so far. This helps to efficiently calculate dp[k][j-1] * (the number of ways to partition A[0..k-1] into k partitions).

Update the plan as follows:

* Initialize dp and prev arrays with zeros.
* Iterate over the array A, updating dp[i][j] based on previous values and the current maximum element seen so far.
* For each i, iterate from j = K to 1, and update dp[i][j] if the condition holds true.
* Return dp[N][K] as the result.

This plan correctly addresses edge cases such as N = 0 or K = 0. The use of memoization helps to reduce computational complexity by avoiding redundant calculations.
