State: dp[i][j] = 1 if it is possible to make all connected components in the sub-tree rooted at node i with exactly j nodes have the same XOR, else 0.

dp[i][j] = (1 if there's a node u in the subtree rooted at i such that 
    dp[u][k-1] is 1 and all values except the value at u have the same XOR, 
    else 0);

initialization: 
    dp[0][j] = 0 for j = 0 to k (since there's no node 0)

dp[i][j] = (1 if there's a node u in the subtree rooted at i such that 
    dp[u][k-1] is 1 and all values except the value at u have the same XOR, 
    else 0);

for each edge (u, v):
    for j from k-1 to 1:
        if dp[u][j-1] is 1:
            if dp[v][j-1] is 1:
                dp[i][j] = 1
            else: 
                dp[i][j] = 0
        elif dp[v][j-1] is 1:
            if all values except the value at u have the same XOR:
                dp[i][j] = 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = 0

final answer: dp[0][k]

Note: The plan seems to be correct, but it's missing a crucial point. It doesn't handle the case where k is less than the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at i. This should be handled separately.
