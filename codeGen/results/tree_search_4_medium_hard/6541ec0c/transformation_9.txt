===BEGIN PLAN===
The tree structure makes me think of a recursive approach with memoization. This is because we need to consider all possible combinations of edge deletions and their resulting connected components.

The state expression could be defined as the number of nodes in a sub-tree rooted at node i, with the base case being trees containing only one node (i.e., leaf nodes).

State: The value assigned to each node in the tree, represented by a set or a list

Use dynamic programming to fill up a 2D table where each cell represents the number of ways to partition the tree rooted at node i into connected components with XOR value j.

Define a recursive function that takes as input the current node i and the desired XOR value j. This function should return the number of nodes in the sub-tree rooted at node i that have the same XOR value j.

The base case for this recursion is when node i has no children, in which case the number of nodes with XOR value j is simply the count of nodes with value j in node i's subtree.

For the recursive case, consider each child c of node i. For each child c, recursively compute the number of nodes in c's subtree that have XOR value j. Then, add 1 to this result if node i also has value j, and subtract 1 if it doesn't (since we're not counting itself). Finally, sum up the results for all children c.
