===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j][xor_val] = 1 if it is possible to make all connected components in the sub-tree rooted at node i with exactly j nodes and having xor_val as the XOR value of each component have the same XOR, else 0.

State:
    - dp[i][j]: boolean indicating whether it's possible to make all connected components in the subtree rooted at node i with exactly j nodes.
    - dp[i][j][xor_val]: boolean indicating whether it's possible to make all connected components in the subtree rooted at node i with exactly j nodes having xor_val as the XOR value of each component.

Transition Function:
    - For each node i from 2 to n, and for each j from 1 to k:
        - dp[i][j] = True if there's an edge between node i-1 and node i.
        - If there is an edge, then consider all possible values of xor_val.
            + If (a[i-1] ^ xor_val) % 2 == 0, update dp[i][j][xor_val] to the AND operation of dp[i-1][k][xor_val] and True for k ranging from 1 to j+1.

Base Case:
    - For node 1, set dp[1][1] = [True], since a single node can always be considered as its own component with the same XOR value.

Final Answer:
    - For each test case, calculate dp[n][k]. If it's True, then output "YES", else output "NO".

This plan seems to handle the constraints correctly and should give the correct answer.
