===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we are looking for a condition that can be met after deleting at most k-1 edges, it seems more natural to use dynamic programming with bottom-up approach (tabulation) as we build up the solutions from smaller subproblems.

Let dp[i][j] represent whether it is possible to delete at most j-1 edges from the tree rooted at node i, considering all previous nodes.
dp[i][j] = True if there are no children;
dp[i][j] = dp[children[i]][max(0, j-1)] for every child node k of i;

Implement memoization by using a dictionary to store previously computed values of dp[i][j] to avoid redundant computations.

For each test case:
    1. Initialize an empty dictionary dp and a variable ans.
    2. Iterate over the edges in the tree, updating dp according to the plan above.
    3. Check if it is possible to delete at most k-1 edges from the tree by checking dp[0][k-1].
    4. If possible, set ans = "YES", otherwise set ans = "NO".
    5. Print ans.
