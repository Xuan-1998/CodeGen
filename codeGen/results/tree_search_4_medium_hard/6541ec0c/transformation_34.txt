State: dp[i][j] = 1 if it is possible to make all connected components in the sub-tree rooted at node i with exactly j nodes have the same XOR, else 0.

dp[i][j] = (1 if there's a node u in the subtree rooted at i such that dp[u][k-1] is 1 and all values except the value at u have the same XOR, else 0);

dp[i] = [False]*(k+1) for i in range(n+1)

Initialization: 
    dp[0][j] = False for j in range(k+1)
    dp[i][0] = True for i in range(1, n+1)

Transition:
    For each node i:
        For each j from k-1 down to 0:
            If there's a child u such that dp[u][k-1-j] is True and the XOR of all values in the subtree rooted at i except the value at u is the same, then set dp[i][j] = True

Output:
    For each node i, return "YES" if dp[i][k] is True, else "NO"
