===BEGIN PLAN===
The tree structure makes me think of a recursive approach with memoization. This is because we need to consider all possible combinations of edge deletions and their resulting connected components.

The state expression could be defined as a boolean indicating whether the tree rooted at node i has a unique XOR value among its connected components, with the base case being single-node trees where this condition is trivially true.

state: integer representing the current XOR value of nodes in the subtree rooted at node i, and transition based on updating this state when traversing the tree

Utilize a top-down approach with memoization, where you define a recursive function that calculates the result for a given node and updates the memoization dictionary accordingly. The base case for the recursion would be when the current node is a leaf (i.e., has no children), in which case the state is trivially true.

The recursive step would involve recursively calling the function on each child of the current node, updating the state based on the XOR values of the children's subtrees, and then checking if the updated state satisfies the condition.

To determine whether it's possible to delete at most k-1 edges such that all connected components have the same XOR value, we would perform a DFS traversal starting from any node, calculating the XOR value for each visited node, and updating our answer accordingly.
