===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we are looking for a condition that can be met after deleting at most k-1 edges, it seems more natural to use dynamic programming with bottom-up approach (tabulation) as we build up the solutions from smaller subproblems.

Let dp[i][j] represent whether it is possible to delete at most j-1 edges from the tree rooted at node i, considering all previous nodes. We can calculate this value based on the values of its children and the value of the current node.

For leaf nodes (i.e., nodes with no children), we set dp[i][j] = True for all 0 ≤ j ≤ k-1, since there are no edges to delete.

For internal nodes, we iterate over each child c of i. For each child c, we calculate whether it's possible to delete at most j-1 edges from the tree rooted at node c, considering all previous nodes (dp[c][j-1]). If this is true and the value of the current node i does not match the bitwise XOR of its children, then we set dp[i][j] = True. Otherwise, we set it to False.

Finally, we return "YES" if dp[1][k-1] is True, and "NO" otherwise.
