===BEGIN PLAN===
The tree structure makes me think of a recursive approach with memoization. This is because we need to consider all possible combinations of edge deletions and their resulting connected components.

The state expression could be defined as a tuple of three integers (min_xor, max_xor, nodes_left) representing the minimum XOR value, maximum XOR value, and number of nodes left in the sub-tree rooted at node i. The base case would be when there are no more nodes left in the tree.

Use dynamic programming with a 4D table where the first dimension is for the current node, the second dimension is for the minimum XOR value, the third dimension is for the maximum XOR value, and the fourth dimension is for the number of nodes left. The base case would be when there are no more nodes left in the tree.

Memoization using a recursive function that uses a dictionary to store intermediate results for subproblems with the same state.

To improve the plan:

* Instead of storing intermediate results in a dictionary, use dynamic programming directly by iterating over all possible combinations of edge deletions.
* In each iteration, calculate the XOR values of the connected components and update the table accordingly.

Potential issues with the plan:

* The recursive function may cause stack overflow for large input sizes. This can be avoided by using dynamic programming.
* The plan does not handle the case when there are no edges left in the tree. This should be added as a special case.

Edge cases:

* What if the input tree is empty?
* What if the input tree has only one node?
