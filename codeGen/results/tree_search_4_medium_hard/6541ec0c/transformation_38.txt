===BEGIN PLAN===
Given the constraints that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, I'm thinking that a bottom-up dynamic programming approach might be faster than a top-down approach due to reduced time complexity for larger inputs.

State: dp[node_val][edge_count] = 1 if it is possible to make all connected components in the tree with edge_count edges and node_val as the value of every node in those components have the same XOR, else 0.
dp[node][edge_count] = 1 if there is a valid configuration for nodes with value node up to edge_count edges, else 0.

Use bottom-up dynamic programming approach and initialize dp array as [[False]*(k+1) for _ in range(10**9 + 1)].

For each node_value from 1 to 10^9:
    For each edge_count from k to 1:
        If node_value is the same as all children, set dp[node_value][edge_count] = True.
        Else, iterate over each child and for each child, if there is a valid configuration for that child up to edge_count - 1 edges, then update dp[child_node_val][edge_count-1] = True.

For each node_value from 1 to 10^9:
    If dp[node_value][k] is True, return "YES".
Else, return "NO".
