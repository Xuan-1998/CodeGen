===BEGIN PLAN===
The tree structure makes me think of a recursive approach with memoization. This is because we need to consider all possible combinations of edge deletions and their resulting connected components.

The state expression could be defined as a pair of integers representing the minimum and maximum XOR values of all connected components in the sub-tree rooted at node i, with the base case being empty subtrees where these bounds are irrelevant.

Consider a recursive function that takes four parameters: current node i, minimum XOR value mi, maximum XOR value mx, and k - 1 as the remaining edges to be deleted. The function would recursively traverse the tree, updating the state based on the XOR values of nodes in each subtree and the number of edges to be deleted.

Think about implementing memoization using a dictionary to store the intermediate results and avoid redundant computations.

The recursive function could return "YES" if it's possible to delete at least one edge from the sub-tree such that all connected components have the same bitwise XOR value, or "NO" otherwise.

To avoid edge cases where k is too small or n is 1, we should add a condition to check if k >= n - 1 before entering the recursive function. This ensures that the problem statement's constraints are respected.

The function would also need to handle the case when it reaches a leaf node (i.e., a node with no children), in which case it returns "YES" if all connected components have the same bitwise XOR value and at least one edge can be deleted, or "NO" otherwise.

Here's an example of how this plan could be implemented:
