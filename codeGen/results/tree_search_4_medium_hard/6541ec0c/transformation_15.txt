===BEGIN PLAN===
The tree structure makes me think of a recursive approach with memoization. This is because we need to consider all possible combinations of edge deletions and their resulting connected components.

state: dictionary representing the XOR values for each node i, where state[i] = (is_unique_xor_value, current_xor_value)
    - is_unique_xor_value: boolean indicating whether the tree rooted at node i has a unique XOR value among its connected components
    - current_xor_value: integer representing the current XOR value of nodes in the subtree rooted at node i

The base case could be a single-node tree where this condition is trivially true. We can start from any node and recursively traverse the tree, updating the state as we go.

Use a recursive function with a dictionary-based memoization to store intermediate results.

Function: dfs(node_id)
    - Base case: if node_id has no children, return (True, 0) since it's a single-node tree
    - Recursive case:
        * Traverse all children of node_id
        * For each child, calculate the XOR value of its nodes and update the state accordingly
        * If any child returns False for is_unique_xor_value, return False
        * Otherwise, return (True, current_xor_value)

Memoization: store intermediate results in a dictionary memo[node_id] = (is_unique_xor_value, current_xor_value)
    - Before calculating the result for node_id, check if it's already stored in memo
    - If found, use the cached value instead of recalculating

Return the result of dfs(0) as the answer, where 0 is an arbitrary root node.
