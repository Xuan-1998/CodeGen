===BEGIN PLAN===
The tree structure makes me think of a recursive approach with memoization. This is because we need to consider all possible combinations of edge deletions and their resulting connected components.

State: dp[i] = {number of nodes in subtree rooted at node i, number of edges in the subtree, set of values in the subtree}

Base case: A tree containing only one node (i.e., a leaf node) with no edges and value equal to its assigned value

State transition:
- If node i is not visited yet (i.e., it's still in the recursion stack), then recursively explore all its children, update dp[i] accordingly.
- If node i has been visited before (i.e., it's popped from the recursion stack), then return the cached result for that subtree.

Memoization:
- Create a memo dictionary to store the results of subproblems. When exploring a subtree, check if the result is already stored in memo; if so, return it directly.
- Update the memo dictionary with the current result after exploring each subtree.

Edge cases:
- Handle trees with fewer than 2 nodes (i.e., no edges).
- Handle trees with only one node (i.e., a leaf node).
