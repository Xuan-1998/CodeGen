===BEGIN PLAN===
The tree structure makes me think of a recursive approach with memoization. This is because we need to consider all possible combinations of edge deletions and their resulting connected components.

The state expression could be defined as a pair of integers representing the minimum and maximum XOR values of all connected components in the sub-tree rooted at node i, with the base case being empty subtrees where these bounds are irrelevant.

However, this problem seems more suitable for Depth-First Search (DFS) than Dynamic Programming. This is because we need to consider the tree structure and delete edges one by one.

Use a DFS-based approach where each node has two values: the minimum XOR value of its connected components and the maximum XOR value of its connected components. We can start from an arbitrary node, and for each edge we delete, update the values of the nodes in the connected components.

Tabulation by filling up a 2D table where each cell is filled based on the minimum number of edges to remove in its subtrees. This will help us track the possible combinations of edge deletions and their resulting connected components.
