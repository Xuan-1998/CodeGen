===BEGIN PLAN===
The tree structure makes me think of a recursive approach with memoization. This is because we need to consider all possible combinations of edge deletions and their resulting connected components.

The state expression could be defined as a pair of integers representing the minimum and maximum XOR values of all connected components in the sub-tree rooted at node i, with the base case being empty subtrees where these bounds are irrelevant.

Define a state as a tuple (i, mi, mx) representing the current node i, minimum XOR value mi, and maximum XOR value mx. Define a transition function that updates the state by considering all possible edge deletions from the current node i.

Define a recursive function dfs(node, mi, mx) that takes the current node's state as input and returns an updated state after considering all possible edge deletions from the current node. The function should return (node, min(mi + ai, mx + ai), max(mi + ai, mx + ai)) where ai is the value of the current node.

The base case for the recursion would be when there are no more nodes to consider or when we have reached the maximum allowed number of deleted edges.

To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can use a 3D array dp[i][k][2] where i ranges from 0 to n-1, k ranges from 0 to min(n-1, k), and the last dimension is (mi, mx). The value at dp[i][k][mi, mx] would be 1 if it's possible to get XOR values ranging from mi to mx by deleting up to k edges in the sub-tree rooted at node i, and 0 otherwise.

We can then fill this array in a bottom-up manner using the transition function. Finally, we can iterate over all nodes and check for all possible combinations of edge deletions that result in XOR values being the same across all connected components. If we find such a combination, we return "YES", otherwise, we return "NO".
