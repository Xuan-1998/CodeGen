===BEGIN PLAN===
The tree structure makes me think of a recursive approach with memoization. This is because we need to consider all possible combinations of edge deletions and their resulting connected components.

state: a dictionary representing the subtree rooted at node i, mapping each node to its value
transition by updating this dictionary when adding or removing nodes from the subtree

function dp(i):
    if i has only one child:
        return True
    else:
        for j in i's children:
            if j is not root(j) and root(j) is not None:
                if root(j) is not None:
                    return False
        return True

memo = {}
def solve(n, k):
    memo[(0, 0)] = True
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(i+1, n+1):
            if dp(i):
                if dp(j):
                    result = (i, j)
                    return result
