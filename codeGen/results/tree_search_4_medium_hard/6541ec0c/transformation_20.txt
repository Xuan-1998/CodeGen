===BEGIN PLAN===
The tree structure makes me think of a recursive approach with memoization. This is because we need to consider all possible combinations of edge deletions and their resulting connected components.

The state expression could be defined as a boolean indicating whether the tree rooted at node i has a unique XOR value among its connected components, with the base case being single-node trees where this condition is trivially true.

state: a list of integers representing the values of nodes in the subtree rooted at node i, and transition by updating this list when adding or removing nodes from the subtree

Tabulate values using a bottom-up approach with iteration

For each node i:
    1. Initialize state[i] as [node value]
    2. For each child j of i:
        - Recursively calculate the state[j] for each child
        - Calculate the XOR of all child states and add to state[i]
    3. If k > 0, try removing edges:
        - For each child j of i, remove the edge between i and j
        - Recursively calculate the state[j] for each removed child
        - Update the state[i] with the XOR of all child states
    4. If there are no more nodes to process or k reaches 0, return the state

For each test case:
    1. Initialize a boolean variable result as TRUE
    2. For each node i:
        - Calculate the state[i]
        - If the XOR value is not unique among its connected components, set result as FALSE and break the loop
    3. Print "YES" if result is TRUE, otherwise print "NO"
