===BEGIN PLAN===
State: dp[i][j] = 1 if it is possible to make all connected components in the sub-tree rooted at node i with exactly j nodes have the same XOR, else 0.

dp[i][j] = (1 if the subtree rooted at i has an even number of nodes and all values are the same in the XOR, else 0);

Fill up dp table by iterating over the tree. For each node i:
    If i is a leaf node: 
        dp[i][1] = 1 if value of node i can be made equal to every other node's value.
    Else:
        Iterate over all children c of node i, and recursively fill up dp[c][j] for j from 1 to k-1. Then calculate dp[i][j] as the maximum of these values.

The final answer will be the maximum j such that dp[root][j] is 1.
