===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we are looking for a condition that can be met after deleting at most k-1 edges, it seems more natural to use dynamic programming with bottom-up approach (tabulation) as we build up the solutions from smaller subproblems.

Let dp[i][j] represent whether it is possible to delete at most j-1 edges from the tree rooted at node i, considering all previous nodes.

Create a dynamic programming table with size (n+1) x (k+1), where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to delete at most j-1 edges from the tree rooted at node i, considering all previous nodes.

For each node i, we need to consider its children and update our dp[i][j] accordingly. If a child node k has a value that is not the XOR of its parent's value with any other values in its subtree (since deleting this edge would disconnect it from its parent), then we cannot delete edges in this subtree without changing the bitwise XOR.

For each node i, iterate over its children and for each child k, check if the XOR of its parent's value with any other values in its subtree is equal to its own value. If yes, update dp[i][j] = False; otherwise, dp[i][j] = True.

Finally, return "YES" if dp[1][k-1] is True and "NO" otherwise.
