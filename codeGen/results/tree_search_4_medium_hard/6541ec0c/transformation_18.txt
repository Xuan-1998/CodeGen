===BEGIN PLAN===
The tree structure makes me think of a recursive approach with memoization. This is because we need to consider all possible combinations of edge deletions and their resulting connected components.

The state expression could be defined as a boolean indicating whether the tree rooted at node i has a unique XOR value among its connected components, with the base case being single-node trees where this condition is trivially true.

state: 
    - dp[i]: A boolean array representing for each node i, whether it's possible to delete edges so that all nodes in its subtree have the same XOR value.
transition:
    - For a leaf node i (only one child), return True
    - For an internal node i with children j and k: 
        * If the XOR of values in the left subtree is the same as the right, then check if either or both subtrees satisfy the condition. If yes, return True.
        * Else, recursively try to delete edges from the left and right subtrees separately and combine their results.

Use dynamic programming with a recursive state expression to update a memoized table
