===BEGIN PLAN===
The tree structure makes me think of a recursive approach with memoization. This is because we need to consider all possible combinations of edge deletions and their resulting connected components.

The state expression could be defined as a boolean indicating whether the tree rooted at node i has a unique XOR value among its connected components, with the base case being single-node trees where this condition is trivially true.

state: boolean[] memo; // memoized results for sub-trees
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    state[i] = false; // initialize all states as unknown
}

function dfs(node, parent):
    if (node == -1) return; // base case: empty tree

    for each child of node:
        dfs(child, node); // explore sub-tree rooted at child
        if (parent != -1): // only consider edges not connecting the current node to its parent
            // compute XOR value of connected components in this subtree
            int xor_value = 0;
            foreach child:
                xor_value ^= values[child];
            // check if all subtrees have the same XOR value as the root
            for each child:
                if (xor_value != values[child]):
                    state[node] = false; // set current node's state to unknown
                    break;

    if (!parent): // update parent node's state based on its children's states
        int xor_value = 0;
        boolean has_unique_xor = true;
        for each child:
            xor_value ^= values[child];
            if (state[child]):
                state[node] = false; // set current node's state to unknown

    // now, all nodes' states are updated based on their subtrees
    // we can check the root node's state to determine whether it is possible to delete edges and satisfy the condition

function solve(k):
    for each node:
        if (state[node]):
            return "YES"; // it is possible to delete at most k-1 edges
    return "NO"; // impossible to satisfy the condition with less than k-1 edge deletions
