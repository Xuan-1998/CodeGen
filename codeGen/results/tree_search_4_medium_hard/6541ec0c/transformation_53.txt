===BEGIN PLAN===
Given the constraints that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, I'm thinking that a bottom-up dynamic programming approach might be faster than a top-down approach due to reduced time complexity for larger inputs.

State: dp[i][j][xor_val] = 1 if it is possible to make all connected components in the sub-tree rooted at node i with exactly j nodes and having xor_val as the XOR value of each component have the same XOR, else 0.
dp[i][j][xor_val] = 1 if all subtrees rooted at node i with exactly j nodes and having xor_val as their XOR value can be made to have the same XOR after at most k edge deletions, else 0.

Use a 3D table dp[i][j][xor_val] where i represents node indices, j represents number of nodes in the subtree rooted at i, and xor_val represents the XOR value of each component.
For each node i, iterate from 1 to n (inclusive) for number of nodes j. Then, iterate from 0 to 10^9 (inclusive) for xor_val. For each pair (j, xor_val), check if it is possible to make all connected components in the sub-tree rooted at node i with exactly j nodes and having xor_val as their XOR value have the same XOR.

Update:
For each edge between node u and v, update dp[u][j-1][xor_val] for all j from 2 to min(j, n) and xor_val from 0 to 10^9 (inclusive). If there exists a node w such that dp[w][j][xor_val] is 1, then mark this edge as removable.
If the number of removable edges is at least k-1, return "YES", else return "NO".
