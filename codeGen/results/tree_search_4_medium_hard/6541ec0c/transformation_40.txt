===BEGIN PLAN===
Given the constraints that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, I'm thinking that a bottom-up dynamic programming approach might be faster than a top-down approach due to reduced time complexity for larger inputs.

State: dp[node_val][edge_count] = 1 if it is possible to make all connected components in the tree with edge_count edges and node_val as the value of every node in those components have the same XOR, else 0.
dp[node][edge_count] = 1 if there is a valid configuration for nodes with value node up to edge_count edges, else 0.

Use a dictionary-based memoization approach by storing previously computed values of dp in a dictionary.
For each node, check all possible combinations of edges connected to it and update the dp state accordingly.

State transition:
- If a node has no children (i.e., it's a leaf node), dp[node][edge_count] = 1 only if edge_count is less than or equal to k-1.
- If a node has children, consider all possible configurations of edges between them and update the dp state accordingly.

Iterate through all nodes in the tree, considering each node as a root node. For each node, try all combinations of edges connected to it, and update the dp state.

Finally, iterate through all nodes again, checking if there exists at least one valid configuration for every connected component with XOR equal to 0 (i.e., dp[node][edge_count] = 1 for some edge_count). If found, return "YES". Else, return "NO".
