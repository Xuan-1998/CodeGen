===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we are looking for a condition that can be met after deleting at most k-1 edges, it seems more natural to use dynamic programming with bottom-up approach (tabulation) as we build up the solutions from smaller subproblems.

Let dp[i][j] represent whether it is possible to delete at most j-1 edges from the tree rooted at node i, considering all previous nodes.

dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to delete at most j-1 edges from the tree rooted at node i, considering all previous nodes (dp[i][j] = True if node i has value x and all its children have values y such that y ^ x == 0;)

For each edge connecting node u to node v, we can update dp[u][j] by checking whether it's possible to delete at most j-1 edges from the tree rooted at node u, considering all previous nodes, and also considering the value of node v.

We can do this by iterating over all nodes and for each node i, iterate from k-1 to 1 and fill in the dp[i][j] values accordingly. This ensures that we consider all possible edge deletions.

For the leaf nodes (nodes with no children), we can set their corresponding dp values as True if they meet the condition of bitwise XOR being the same for their subtree.

We also need to handle the root node separately, since it doesn't have a parent node.

Finally, after filling up the dp array, we can check whether it's possible to delete at most k-1 edges from the entire tree by checking dp[0][k-1].
