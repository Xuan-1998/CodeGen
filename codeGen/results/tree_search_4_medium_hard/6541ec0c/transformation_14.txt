===BEGIN PLAN===
The tree structure makes me think of a recursive approach with memoization. This is because we need to consider all possible combinations of edge deletions and their resulting connected components.

state: boolean indicating whether tree rooted at node i has a unique XOR value among its connected components, with memoized results for sub-trees

Dynamically create a table where each entry corresponds to a node's unique XOR value among its connected components and update it accordingly. 

Create an array dp[] of size n+1 where dp[i] will store the answer for node i.

For each node i:

* If i is a leaf node (no children), then the answer is True.
* Else, consider all possible subtrees rooted at i's children. For each child j:
    * Calculate the XOR value of its connected components and store it in variable xor_val.
    * Check if all subtrees rooted at other children k (k != j) have the same XOR value as xor_val. If they do, then dp[i] = True; otherwise, dp[i] = False.
* Return dp[n].
