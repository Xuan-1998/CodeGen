===BEGIN PLAN===
The tree structure makes me think of a recursive approach with memoization. This is because we need to consider all possible combinations of edge deletions and their resulting connected components.

The state expression could be defined as a pair of integers representing the minimum and maximum XOR values of all connected components in the sub-tree rooted at node i, with the base case being empty subtrees where these bounds are irrelevant.

Consider using a dynamic programming approach to fill up a table, where each cell represents the possible combinations of edge deletions for a given subtree. Initialize the table with base cases (empty subtrees) and then recursively populate it by considering all child nodes and their corresponding XOR values.

To avoid redundant calculations, use memoization to store the results of subproblems in the table. This can be achieved using a hash map where the key is the state (node i, mi, mx) and the value is the result of the recursive function call.

The final answer would be whether there exists at least one combination of edge deletions that satisfies the condition for all connected components in the original tree.
