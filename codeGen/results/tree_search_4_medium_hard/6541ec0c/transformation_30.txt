===BEGIN PLAN===
Given the constraints that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, I'm thinking that a bottom-up dynamic programming approach might be faster than a top-down approach due to reduced time complexity for larger inputs.

State: dp[i][j] = 1 if it is possible to make all connected components in the sub-tree rooted at node i with exactly j nodes have the same XOR, else 0.
dp[i][j] = (1 if the subtree rooted at i has an even number of nodes and all values are the same in the XOR, else 0);

Create a dp table with dimensions n+1 x k+1, where dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to make all connected components in the sub-tree rooted at node i have exactly j nodes and the same XOR.

Initialize dp[0][0] = 1 since we can always delete all edges from an empty graph.

For each node i from 1 to n:
    For each number of nodes j from 0 to k:
        If the current node has value v_i, calculate the XOR of the values in its left subtree and store it as x.
        If j == 0, set dp[i][j] = 1 if and only if x is the same as v_i (since we can't delete edges from a single node).
        Else:
            Initialize the maximum possible XOR for this sub-tree to -1.
            For each node in the left subtree of i:
                If the node has an even number of children, update the maximum possible XOR with the XOR of the node's value and the current max XOR.
                Otherwise, check if the node's value is the same as the XOR of its children; if so, update the maximum possible XOR.
            Set dp[i][j] = 1 if the maximum possible XOR for this sub-tree matches x.

For each test case:
    If there exists a j such that dp[n][j] == 1 and j <= k-1, output "YES".
    Else, output "NO".
