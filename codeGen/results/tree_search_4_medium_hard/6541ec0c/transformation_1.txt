===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we are looking for a condition that can be met after deleting at most k-1 edges, it seems more natural to use dynamic programming with bottom-up approach (tabulation) as we build up the solutions from smaller subproblems.

Let dp[i][j] represent whether it is possible to delete at most j-1 edges from the tree rooted at node i, considering all previous nodes.
dp[i][0] = True if the node is root
dp[i][j+1] = True if dp[i][j] and for every child node k of i, dp[k][max(0, j-1)] = True

Implement memoization using a dictionary to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

For each node i, iterate over its children j. If the current child j has already been processed (i.e., its corresponding dp[j] is available), calculate dp[i][j+1] based on whether it's possible to delete at most j-1 edges from the tree rooted at node j and recursively process all of its own children.
If the current child j hasn't been processed yet, mark as False for now (it will be re-calculated later).

After processing all nodes, check if dp[0][k] is True. If it's not, return "NO". Otherwise, return "YES".
