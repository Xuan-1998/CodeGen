===BEGIN PLAN===
The tree structure makes me think of a recursive approach with memoization. This is because we need to consider all possible combinations of edge deletions and their resulting connected components.

The state expression could be defined as a pair of integers representing the minimum and maximum XOR values of all connected components in the sub-tree rooted at node i, with the base case being empty subtrees where these bounds are irrelevant.

Define a state as a tuple (i, mi, mx) representing the current node i, minimum XOR value mi, and maximum XOR value mx. Define a transition function that updates the state by considering all possible edge deletions from the current node i.

Use dynamic programming to create a 3D table where each cell represents the minimum and maximum XOR values of all connected components in the sub-tree rooted at node i, considering at most k-1 edge deletions.

For each node i, iterate over its children j. For each child j, consider deleting the edge between i and j. Update the state by calculating the new mi and mx values based on the current state and the values of nodes in the subtree rooted at j.

Use a pruning strategy to reduce the number of states to consider. For example, if we know that the minimum XOR value is greater than the maximum XOR value for some sub-tree, we can skip considering that sub-tree further.
