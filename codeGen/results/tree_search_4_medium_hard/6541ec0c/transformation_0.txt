===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i][j] represent whether it is possible to delete at most j-1 edges from the tree rooted at node i, considering all previous nodes.

Use a 2D table with size (n+1) x (k+1), where dp[i][j] represents whether it is possible to delete at most j-1 edges from the tree rooted at node i, considering all previous nodes.

For each edge (u,v), if u<v, update dp[v][max(0,j-1)] using dp[u][max(0,j-1)]. This represents the fact that we can only consider edges that haven't been processed yet.

Finally, return "YES" if there exists a node i such that dp[i][k] is True; otherwise, return "NO".

This plan ensures that it correctly checks all possible subproblems and builds up the solution from smaller problems.
