===BEGIN PLAN===
Given the constraints that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, I'm thinking that a bottom-up dynamic programming approach might be faster than a top-down approach due to reduced time complexity for larger inputs.

State: dp[node_val][edge_count] = 1 if it is possible to make all connected components in the tree with edge_count edges and node_val as the value of every node in those components have the same XOR, else 0.

We can iterate through each node in the tree and consider removing all its edges. This would create k-1 new connected components. We then update dp[node][edge_count] based on whether it's possible to make all these components have the same XOR value.

To do this, we can sort the nodes by their values. Then, for each edge (u, v), if u and v are in different connected components, we can remove the edge without affecting the XOR value of the remaining components. This means that dp[u][edge_count] = 1 implies dp[v][edge_count] = 1 as well.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting, which is efficient given the constraints.
