===BEGIN PLAN===
The tree structure makes me think of a recursive approach with memoization. This is because we need to consider all possible combinations of edge deletions and their resulting connected components.

The state expression could be defined as a tuple (i, mi, mx) representing the current node i, minimum XOR value mi, and maximum XOR value mx. Define a state as a tuple (i, mi, mx) representing the current node i, minimum XOR value mi, and maximum XOR value mx.

Define a transition function that updates the state by considering all possible edge deletions from the current node i. For each child node j, update the state by recursively calling the function with the new state as (j, xor(a[i], a[j]), xor(a[i], a[j])) if the parent-child edge is deleted.

Implement memoization using recursion with a dictionary to store previously computed results for overlapping sub-trees.

For each test case, initialize an empty dictionary dp and compute the result for the root node. If there exists a connected component that has XOR value not in the range [mi, mx], output "NO". Otherwise, output "YES".
