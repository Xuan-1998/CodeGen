===BEGIN PLAN===
Given the constraints that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, I'm thinking that a bottom-up dynamic programming approach might be faster than a top-down approach due to reduced time complexity for larger inputs.

State: dp[i][j] = 
    if it is possible to make all connected components in the sub-tree rooted at node i with exactly j nodes have the same XOR, else 0.
dp[i][j] = 
    (1 
        if the subtree rooted at i has an even number of nodes and all values are the same in the XOR, 
        else 0); 

Use memoization by creating a dictionary to store previously computed values of dp[i][j], and update the table based on these stored values.
Use the following base cases:
    - Base case: For leaf nodes (i.e., nodes with no children), set dp[i][1] = 1 if all values are the same in the XOR, else 0. 
    - Recursive case: For a node i with children ci for j in [2..k], update dp[i][j] based on the minimum value of dp[ci][j-1] over all ci such that 1 ≤ ci ≤ n and ci ≠ i.
