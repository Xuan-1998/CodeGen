State: dp[i][j] = 1 if it is possible to make all connected components in the sub-tree rooted at node i with exactly j nodes have the same XOR, else 0.

dp[i][0] = 1 for all i (base case)

dp[i][j] = 1 if and only if 
    - All children of i have dp[ui][j-1] = 1
    - AND all parents of i have dp[vi][j-1] = 1

if the above condition is met, then it's possible to make all connected components in the subtree rooted at node i with exactly j nodes have the same XOR.

This plan can be improved by iterating over children and parents first and then update dp[i][j]. This way we reduce unnecessary calculations.

Potential issues:
- The base case should include checking for single node trees.
- Edge cases: If k = 1, then it's always possible to delete at most k-1 edges.
