===BEGIN PLAN===
The tree structure makes me think of a recursive approach with memoization. This is because we need to consider all possible combinations of edge deletions and their resulting connected components.

The state expression could be defined as a pair of integers representing the minimum and maximum XOR values of all connected components in the sub-tree rooted at node i, with the base case being empty subtrees where these bounds are irrelevant.

Consider a recursive function that takes three parameters: current node i, minimum XOR value mi, and maximum XOR value mx. The function would recursively traverse the tree, updating the state based on the XOR values of nodes in each subtree and the number of edges to be deleted.

Try using dynamic programming with tabulation by initializing a 3D array dp, where dp[i][j][k] represents whether it's possible to delete at most j edges from the subtree rooted at node i such that for every connected component, the bitwise XOR of the values of nodes in it is k. The base case would be when there are no more edges to be deleted (i.e., j == 0), and we can check if all connected components have the same XOR value.

Update the dp array by considering each node i and each possible number of edges j to be deleted from the subtree rooted at i. For each edge e, calculate the XOR values for both subtrees after removing e and update dp[i][j][k] accordingly.

Finally, return whether it's possible to delete at most k-1 edges such that all connected components have the same XOR value by checking if there exists a state in dp where j == k-1.
