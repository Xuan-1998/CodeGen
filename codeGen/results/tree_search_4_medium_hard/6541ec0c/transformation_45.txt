Given the constraints that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5, I'm thinking that a bottom-up dynamic programming approach might be faster than a top-down approach due to reduced time complexity for larger inputs.

State: dp[node_val][edge_count] = 1 if it is possible to make all connected components in the tree with edge_count edges and node_val as the value of every node in those components have the same XOR, else 0.
dp[prev_node][curr_edge_count] = 1 if there is a valid configuration for nodes with values up to prev_node, with curr_edge_count edges remaining, else 0.

Use dynamic programming with three nested loops:
    - Loop over all possible node values
    - For each node value, loop over all possible edge counts
    - For each pair of node value and edge count, calculate the XOR of the node values in the connected components

Check if it's possible to make all connected components have the same XOR by considering the edges that need to be removed.
