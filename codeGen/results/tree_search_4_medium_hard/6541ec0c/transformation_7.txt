===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i][j] represent whether it is possible to delete at most j-1 edges from the tree rooted at node i, considering all previous nodes.

The base case is when there are no children for a given node. In this case, we can always achieve the condition by not deleting any edges (dp[i][0] = True).

For each node i and integer j, we consider two cases: either delete an edge from node i or don't delete any edges.

If we decide to delete an edge from node i, then dp[i][j-1] must be True. This is because we need to ensure that after deleting the edge, all children of node i have the same XOR value as node i.

On the other hand, if we don't delete any edges, then the condition holds true for all children of node i (dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]).

We use memoization by defining a dictionary that maps (i, j) tuples to their corresponding boolean values. This allows us to avoid recomputing the same subproblems multiple times.

The final answer is whether dp[0][k-1] is True. If it's True, then we can delete at most k-1 edges and achieve the condition for all connected components.
