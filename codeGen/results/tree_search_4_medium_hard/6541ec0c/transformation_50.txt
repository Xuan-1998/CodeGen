State: dp[i][j][xor_val] = 1 if it is possible to make all connected components in the sub-tree rooted at node i with exactly j nodes and having xor_val as the XOR value of each component have the same XOR, else 0.

dp[i][j] = 1 if there are at least k edges deleted from the tree such that for every connected component in the remaining subtree rooted at node i, the bitwise XOR of its nodes is the same with dp[prev_node][j-1], else 0.

Create a 3D DP array to store states for each node, number of edges deleted, and XOR value

Step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize the 3D DP array with all values as 0.
2. Iterate over each node i from 1 to n (inclusive).
    - For each node i, iterate over each possible number of edges deleted j from 0 to k-1 (inclusive).
        - For each possible XOR value xor_val from 0 to 10^9 (inclusive), update the DP state accordingly.
            - If it's possible to make all connected components in the sub-tree rooted at node i with exactly j nodes and having xor_val as the XOR value of each component have the same XOR, set dp[i][j][xor_val] = 1. Else, keep it as 0.

Step to check if it is possible:
1. Iterate over each node i from 1 to n (inclusive).
    - For each node i, iterate over each possible number of edges deleted j from k-1 to 0 (decrementing by 1 each time).
        - If dp[i][j] = 1, return "YES". Else, continue.

If the algorithm ends up not returning "YES" for all test cases, it means that it's impossible to make all connected components in the remaining subtree rooted at node i have the same XOR.
So, output "NO".
