Let's break down and analyze the plan:

The state is indeed defined as (k, l) where k represents the number of letters that can still appear at the beginning of the word, and l represents the current position in the alphabet.

The base case would be when all letters have been placed or the alphabet is exhausted. This makes sense because once we've used up all the letters or reached the end of the alphabet, there's no more possible words to generate.

Now, let's develop a recursive function that calculates the value based on the base cases and previous calculations. The function would take (k, l) as input and return the number of possible words that can be formed with k remaining letters and considering the current position in the alphabet is l.

One potential issue with this plan is that it might not account for the constraint 2i>n when deciding which letters can follow each other. We need to incorporate this rule into our recursive function.

Edge cases should also be considered, such as when k=0 (no more remaining letters) or l=n (we've reached the end of the alphabet).

Here's an updated version of the plan:

state: (k, l) where k is the number of remaining letters that can appear at the beginning, and l is the current position in the alphabet.
Let k' = min(k-1, 2l-n) be the maximum number of letters that can follow the letter at position l.

Let's define a recursive function dp(k, l) that returns the number of possible words that can be formed with k remaining letters and considering the current position in the alphabet is l:

dp(0, n) = 1 (base case: no more remaining letters)
dp(k, l) = sum(dp(min(k-1, 2l-n), i) for i in range(l+1)) + dp(k-k', l)

where k' is calculated as above.

The base cases are:

* dp(0, n) = 1 (no more remaining letters)
* dp(k, n) = 1 if k=0 or 2n > size of alphabet

This plan should correctly calculate the number of possible words that can be formed in the alien language. It takes into account the constraint 2i>n when deciding which letters can follow each other and also handles edge cases.
