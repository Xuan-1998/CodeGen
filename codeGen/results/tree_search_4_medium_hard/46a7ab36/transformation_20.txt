The state could be represented by (n, m) where n is the remaining size of the alphabet and m is the remaining length of the word. The base case would be when there are no more characters left to place in the word.

dp[i][j] = (
    j == 0
        ? 1
        : sum(
            dp[k][j-1] * 
            min(min(2*k + m, n), k/2 + m) - k/2
            for k in range(i+1)
        ),
    for 0 <= i < n, j >= 0

Use dictionary to store the results of subproblems and look them up as needed

if j == 0:
    return 1
elif dp[i][j-1] is not None:
    result = 0
    for k in range(i+1):
        if 2*k + m <= n and (k/2 + m >= j or k/2 + m >= i - k):
            result += dp[k][j-1]
    return result % (10**8 + 7)
else:
    return 0
