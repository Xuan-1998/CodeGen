Feedback:

The plan is correct. It captures the essential idea of using dynamic programming to solve this problem.

Improvement suggestions:

* Consider adding a check for edge cases, such as when i <= 0 or j <= 0.
* The transition condition can be simplified further by removing the inner if statement and directly calculating the sum based on the remaining letters in the alphabet.

Potential issues with the plan:

* The table initialization could lead to performance issues if n or m is large. Consider using a more efficient data structure, such as a dictionary, instead.
