===BEGIN PLAN===
state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, j is the current index for string B, and k is the number of common characters found so far;
The base case is when there are no more common characters to find, at which point the maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common characters minus the total lengths of the strings.
For each possible substring S1 in A and each possible substring S2 in B, calculate LCS(S1, S2) and add it to k
state_expression = (i+1, j+1, k) if current characters match
state_expression = (i, j+1, 0) or (i+1, j, 0) if characters don't match
Implement a recursive function with memoization to calculate the maximum similarity score
For each possible substring S1 in A and each possible substring S2 in B, use dynamic programming to fill up a 2D table where dp[i][j] represents the maximum similarity score for substrings ending at i in string A and j in string B
In the bottom-up approach, start from the base case (i.e., when there are no more common characters to find) and work your way up
