===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with memoization to build a 2D table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings.

State expression: dp[i][j] represents the LCS of substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1].

Base case: When one or both strings are empty, the LCS is an empty string.

Transition relationship:
  - If A[i-1] == B[j-1], then dp[i][j] = 4 * length(LCS) - (i + j) = 4 * length(dp[i-1][j-1]) - (i + j)
  - Else, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

Memoization: Store the results of subproblems in a dictionary or hash map and reuse them when necessary.

Edge cases:
  - When one or both strings are empty, return the similarity score as 0.
  - When the two input strings are identical, return the similarity score as 4 * length(A) - 2 * length(A)

This plan seems correct in terms of capturing the essence of dynamic programming. The state expression and transition relationship correctly represent the LCS problem.

The memoization step is essential to avoid redundant computations and improve the efficiency of the solution.

The edge cases are also well-handled, as they cover the base cases when one or both strings are empty.

To further improve this plan, you could consider using a more efficient algorithm for computing the LCS, such as the Ukkonen's algorithm or the Hirschberg's algorithm. However, these algorithms might be overkill given the constraints of the problem (n, m <= 5000).

Overall, this plan is sound and should lead to a correct solution.
