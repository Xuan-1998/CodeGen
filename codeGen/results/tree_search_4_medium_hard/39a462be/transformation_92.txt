Use dynamic programming to build a 3D table where each cell represents the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two substrings. The state expression is the pair of substrings, and the base case is when one or both strings are empty.

The state expression is a 3D array dp[i][j][k] where dp[i][j][k] represents the LCS length of A[0..i-k] and B[0..j-k]. The base case is when k = 0, in which case the LCS length is calculated as 0.

The recursive case is when k > 0. In this case, the LCS length is the maximum of three values:

* dp[i-1][j][k-1] (the LCS length of A[0..i-k] and B[0..j-k-1])
* dp[i][j-1][k-1] (the LCS length of A[0..i-k-1] and B[0..j-k])
* 1 + dp[matrix(i-1)[j-1][k-1]] (the LCS length of A[0..i-k-1] and B[0..j-k-1])

The similarity score is then calculated as 4 times the maximum LCS length minus the sum of the lengths of the two strings.

This plan correctly calculates the maximal similarity score over all pairs of substrings. The recursive case correctly handles the cases where k > 0, and the base case correctly handles the cases where one or both strings are empty. The state expression is clear and well-defined.

The only potential issue with this plan is that it may not be efficient for large input sizes due to its high space complexity. However, since the constraint is n, m <= 5,000, this should not be a problem in practice.
