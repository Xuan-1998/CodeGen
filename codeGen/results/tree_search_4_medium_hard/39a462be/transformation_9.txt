===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be viewed as a 2D DP table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings. To improve the plan, we can precompute and store all possible LCS of A and B using a 1D DP table. This will reduce the time complexity of calculating the LCS for each cell in the 2D DP table.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = max(4 * len(lcs(A[0..i], B[0..j])) - (i + j), dp[i-1][j-1] + 4) if i > 0 and j > 0 else 0

We use a 2D DP table to store the similarity scores between all possible substrings of A and B. The base case is when one of i or j is 0.

The updated plan takes into account the precomputation of LCS and uses a more accurate state expression.
