state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, j is the current index for string B, and k is the number of common characters found so far;
The base case is when there are no more common characters to find, at which point the maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common characters minus the total lengths of the strings.
i, j, k
state_expression = (0, 0, 0) as the initial state where i and j are both starting from the beginning of their respective strings and there have been no common characters found so far;
iterate through each character in both strings using a loop:
    if the current characters match:
        recursively call the function with incremented indices and incremented k
    else:
        calculate the maximum similarity score based on the current state (i, j, k)
        update the memoization table with the calculated value
memoize the results for later use
calculate the maximum similarity score by iterating through each possible pair of substrings and keeping track of the highest score found so far
return the maximum similarity score found
