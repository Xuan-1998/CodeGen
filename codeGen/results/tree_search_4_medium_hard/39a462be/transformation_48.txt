===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by building a suffix tree for both strings and then calculating the similarity score based on the number of nodes at the same level in the suffix trees.

state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, j is the current index for string B, and k is the number of common characters found so far;
The base case is when there are no more common characters to find, at which point the maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common characters minus the total lengths of the strings.

Transition
Dynamic programming with a 2D table: Create a 2D table to store the maximum similarity scores for all possible prefixes of both strings.
Build the suffix tree for string A and string B. For each node in the suffix trees, calculate the number of nodes at the same level. This will give you the number of common characters found so far.

For each pair of substrings from string A and string B, find the longest common subsequence (LCS) using dynamic programming.
The maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the LCS minus the sum of the lengths of the two strings.
