===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by using a 2D table where the state is (i, j) representing the maximum similarity score up to indices i in string A and j in string B.
state_expression = (i, j) represents the maximum similarity score up to indices i in string A and j in string B; The base case is when there are no more common characters to find, at which point the maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common characters minus the total lengths of the strings.
Transition
Implement a dynamic programming table using a 2D array to store the state expressions and their corresponding maximum similarity scores. Initialize the base case where there are no more common characters to find, then fill up the table by considering all possible combinations of characters in string A and B.
The final answer is the value at the last cell (n, m) of the 2D array.
