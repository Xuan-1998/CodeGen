state_expression = dp[i][j]
where dp is a 2D table storing the maximum similarity scores for substrings of lengths i and j;
The base case is when either i or j reaches the end of one of the strings, at which point the maximum similarity score is simply the length of the remaining string minus its own length.
dp[i][j] represents the maximum similarity score for substrings of lengths i and j, with dp[0][j] being the length of string A minus j, and similarly for dp[i][0];
Implement tabulation by creating a 2D table where each cell represents the maximum similarity score for substrings of lengths i and j.
for i from 1 to n:
    for j from 1 to m:
        if i == 1 or j == 1:
            dp[i][j] = min(i, j)
        else:
            max_similarity = 0
            for k from 0 to min(i, j):
                similarity = dp[i-k-1][j-k-1] + k * 4 - i - j
                if similarity > max_similarity:
                    max_similarity = similarity
            dp[i][j] = max_similarity
max_similarity = 0
for i from 1 to n:
    for j from 1 to m:
        if i == 1 or j == 1:
            continue
        if dp[i][j] > max_similarity:
            max_similarity = dp[i][j]
print(max_similarity)
