===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming and building 2D tables for both strings A and B.

state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, j is the current index for string B, and k is the number of common characters found so far;

The base case is when there are no more common characters to find, at which point the maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common characters minus the total lengths of the strings.

For each possible substring S1 in A and each possible substring S2 in B, calculate LCS(S1, S2) and add it to k

Create a 2D table where the state is represented by (i, j, k) and use dynamic programming to fill the table. The cell at position (i, j, k) will store the maximum similarity score for the substrings of length i in A and j in B with k common characters found so far.

The base case for this dynamic programming problem is when i or j reaches 0, at which point there are no more characters to compare. In this case, the maximum similarity score is calculated as 4 times the number of common characters found so far minus the total lengths of the strings.

To fill the table, iterate over all possible substrings S1 in A and S2 in B. For each pair of substrings, calculate LCS(S1, S2) and add it to k. Then, use the current value of k to calculate the maximum similarity score for the current substrings.

The maximum similarity score is then found by iterating over all cells in the table and keeping track of the cell with the highest value.
