Use dynamic programming to build a 2D table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings. The state expression is the pair of substrings, and the base case is when one or both strings are empty.

The state expression is a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the similarity score between the substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1]. The base case is when i or j is 0, in which case the similarity score is calculated as the sum of lengths minus 4 times the length of the shorter string.

The transition equation remains the same: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + 4 * min(i, j), dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) for i > 0 and j > 0. If i or j is 0, the state represents one of the strings being empty, so the transition is calculated based on the other string's length.

The initialization remains: dp = [[[-1 for _ in range(m+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]]: Initialize a 2D table with all elements set to -1 and use it as the base case.
