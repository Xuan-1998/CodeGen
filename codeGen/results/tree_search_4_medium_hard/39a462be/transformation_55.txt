===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming with a 2D table where each cell represents the similarity score for the substrings ending at indices i and j in strings A and B respectively.

state_expression = (i, j) where i is the current index for string A, and j is the current index for string B;

Base case: When there are no more characters to compare (i.e., i == 0 or j == 0), the maximum similarity score is calculated as 4 times the length of the common substring found so far minus the total lengths of the strings.

State:
Use memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a 2D table dp[][] and then looking up these solutions when you need to reuse them. The recurrence relation for filling the dp[][] table is:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + 4, dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

where dp[i][j] represents the maximum similarity score for the substrings ending at indices i and j in strings A and B.

The final answer is stored in dp[n][m].
