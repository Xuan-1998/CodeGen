===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be viewed as a 2D DP table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings. The optimal substructure is the longest common subsequence of two strings, which can be calculated using a 1D DP table.

Define a 2D DP table dp[m+1][n+1] where dp[i][j] represents the similarity score between substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1]. The state expression is dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) if i > 0 and j > 0, otherwise it's 4 * (dp[i-1][j-1] - (i + j)).

The base case is when either i or j is 0. Initialize the DP table as follows: dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 0 for all i and j.

Use a 2D DP table with state transitions to fill the table from top-down, where each cell depends on the values of its top-left neighbor.

The final answer is stored in the bottom-right corner of the DP table: max(dp[m][n]).
