===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be viewed as a 2D DP table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings. The optimal substructure is the longest common subsequence of two strings, which can be calculated using a 1D DP table.

Define a 2D DP table dp[n+1][m+1] where dp[i][j] represents the similarity score between substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1]. The state expression is:

dp[i][j] = max(0, (A[i-1] == B[j-1]) * 4 + dp[i-1][j-1]) if i > 0 and j > 0
otherwise it's 0.

The base case is when either i or j is 0:

dp[i][0] = 0 for all i
dp[0][j] = 0 for all j

Finally, the maximum similarity score is dp[n][m].
