===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to build a 2D table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings. The state expression is the pair of substrings, and the base case is when one or both strings are empty.

The state expression is a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the LCS of substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1]. The base case is when one or both strings are empty, in which case the LCS is an empty string.

The transition relationship is correct: dp[i][j] = 4 * length(LCS) - (i + j). However, we should only consider common characters to calculate the LCS. We can do this by initializing a 2D array lcs[i][j] where lcs[i][j] represents the LCS of substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1] that ends at index i-1 in string A and j-1 in string B. Then, we update dp[i][j] as 4 * lcs[i][j].length - (i + j) if A[i-1] == B[j-1], else dp[i-1][j-1].

Implement tabulation using nested loops to fill up the 2D table with the state values. We should iterate over all characters in both strings and update the table accordingly.

To improve the plan, we can precompute the lengths of strings A and B for easier reference during calculation.

The plan does not explicitly handle edge cases, but it will work correctly as long as the input strings are within the given constraints.
