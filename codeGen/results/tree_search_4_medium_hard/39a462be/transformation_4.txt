===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be viewed as a 3D DP table where each cell represents the maximum similarity score between two substrings. The optimal substructure is the longest common subsequence of two strings, which can be calculated using a 2D DP table.

Let state dp[i][j][k] represent the maximum similarity score between substrings A[0..i-1], B[0..j-1], and C[0..k-1]. The base case is when either i, j, or k is 0, in which case the maximum similarity score is 0.

dp[i][j][k] is the maximum of:
	* dp[i-1][j-1][k-1] + 4*length_of_longest_common_subsequence
	* dp[i-1][j][k]
	* dp[i][j-1][k]

Use a 3D DP array to store the maximum similarity scores for all possible substrings of strings A, B, and C.

To avoid calculating the same subproblems multiple times, use memoization or caching to store the results of subproblems as they are solved. This can significantly improve the efficiency of the algorithm.

The plan includes edge cases, such as when either i, j, or k is 0.
