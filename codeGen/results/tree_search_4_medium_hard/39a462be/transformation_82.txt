===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to build a 2D table where each cell represents the LCS of two substrings. The state expression is the pair of substrings, and the base case is when one or both strings are empty.

The state expression is a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the LCS of substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1]. The base case is when one or both strings are empty, in which case the LCS is an empty string.

The recurrence relation is:
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + (A[i-1] == B[j-1]), dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

This is because we can either include the current characters in the LCS or not. If they match, we add 1 to the length of the LCS. If they don't match, we consider two cases: either the LCS only includes characters from A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1], or it only includes characters from A[0..i-2] and B[0..j-2].

Use this recurrence relation to fill in the 2D array. Then, use memoization with a recursive function that calculates the LCS of two substrings, and then use this function to calculate the maximal similarity score.

The state expression is still dp[i][j], but now it represents the maximum similarity score over all pairs of substrings ending at A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1].

The recurrence relation is:
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + 4 - (i+j), dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

This is because we can either include the current characters in the LCS and add to the similarity score, or not. If they don't match, we consider two cases: either the LCS only includes characters from A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1], or it only includes characters from A[0..i-2] and B[0..j-2].

Finally, return dp[n][m] as the maximal similarity score.
