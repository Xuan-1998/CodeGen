state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A and j is the current index for string B; The state represents the similarity score up to the current indices.

Let state be a tuple (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, j is the current index for string B, and k is the length of the longest common subsequence found so far. The transition relationship would be: if the characters at indices i in string A and j in string B are equal, then (i+1, j+1, max(k, 1)). Otherwise, it's the tuple with the maximum value of k.

Define a recursive function that calculates the state value based on the current characters in the strings and stores the results in a dictionary for memoization.

The plan can be improved by initializing the base case to consider all substrings (i.e., i = 0 and j = 0) with an initial similarity score of 4 times the length of the longest common subsequence of empty strings, which is 0. This ensures that the base case considers all possible pairs of substrings.

The plan also needs to handle edge cases where one string is a prefix of the other or they are identical. In these cases, the maximum similarity score would be the sum of the lengths of the strings minus their LCS length.

To further improve the plan, consider using dynamic programming with bottom-up approach instead of top-down recursive function as it can lead to faster execution time.

Finally, note that this plan does not handle the constraint of $1 \leq n, m \leq 5\*10^3$. If the strings are too large to fit in memory, consider using an external memory algorithm or a distributed computing approach.
