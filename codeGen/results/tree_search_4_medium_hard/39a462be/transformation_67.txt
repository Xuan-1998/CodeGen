===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by building a dynamic programming table where dp[i][j] represents the maximum similarity score when the current substring of A has i characters and the current substring of B has j characters. The state is (i, j) where i is the current index for string A and j is the current index for string B.

state_expression = dp[i][j]
where:
- dp[0][j] is 0 because there are no common characters
- dp[i][0] is 0 because there are no common characters
- base case: when i == n (length of A) or j == m (length of B), the maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common characters minus the total lengths of the strings.
- recursive case:
    - if A[i-1] == B[j-1], then consider including this character in the common substring, so dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1, dp[i-1][j]) (considering all possible lengths of LCS)
    - otherwise, do not include this character in the common substring, so dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

Memoization using recursion to avoid redundant calculations
