state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, j is the current index for string B, and k is the number of common characters found so far; The base case is when there are no more common characters to find, at which point the maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common characters minus the total lengths of the strings.

For each possible pair of characters (a, b) from A[i] to B[j], if a == b then update k and move to the next pair of characters

dp = [[[0 for _ in range(max_len + 1)] for _ in range(max_len + 1)] for _ in range(max_len + 1)]

for i in range(1, max_len + 1):
    for j in range(1, max_len + 1):
        for k in range(max_len + 1):
            if k == 0:
                dp[i][j][k] = 4 * min(i, j) - (i + j)
            else:
                if A[i-1] == B[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j][k] = max(dp[i-1][j-1][k-1], 4*k-(i+j))
                else:
                    dp[i][j][k] = max(dp[i-1][j][k], dp[i][j-1][k])
