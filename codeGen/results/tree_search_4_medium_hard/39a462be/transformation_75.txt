state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, j is the current index for string B, and k is the number of common characters found so far; 
The base case is when there are no more common characters to find, at which point the maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common characters minus the total lengths of the strings.

state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is less than or equal to n, j is less than or equal to m, and k is less than or equal to min(i + 1, j + 1); 

For each possible index i for string A and j for string B, check if characters at indices i and j are the same. If they are, move to the next pair of characters.

state_expression = (i - 1, j - 1, k) if A[i] == B[j]; else state_expression = (n, m, 0);

Use dynamic programming with a 3D table dp[i][j][k] where i is less than or equal to n, j is less than or equal to m, and k is less than or equal to min(i + 1, j + 1) to store the lengths of common subsequences.

dp[i][j][k] = 0 if i > n || j > m; else if A[i] == B[j]:
    dp[i][j][k] = dp[i - 1][j - 1][k] + 1;
else: 
    min(dp[i-1][j][k], dp[i][j-1][k]);

state_expression = (n, m, k); 

return max(dp[n][m][k]) * 4 - n - m;

The plan includes edge cases. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the problem is solved efficiently.
