===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be viewed as a 2D DP table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings. The optimal substructure is the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two strings, which can be calculated using a 1D DP table.
Let state dp[i][j] represent the similarity score between substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1]. The base case is when either i or j is 0, in which case the similarity score is 0.
dp[i][j] represents the maximum similarity score for substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1].

To calculate dp[i][j], consider the following options:
* If the characters at position i of string A and j of string B are equal, then we can add 4 to the similarity score of the substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1]. This is because the LCS now includes an additional character.
* Otherwise, we take the maximum of the similarity scores from the two options:
	+ The similarity score for the substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1].
	+ The similarity score for the substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-2].

The final answer is the maximum of the values in the last row of the 2D DP table, which represents the maximum similarity score over all pairs of substrings.
