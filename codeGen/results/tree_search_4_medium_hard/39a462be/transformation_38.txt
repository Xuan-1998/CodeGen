===BEGIN PLAN===
state_expression = dp[i][j] where dp is a 2D table storing the maximum similarity scores for substrings of lengths i and j;
The base case is when either i or j reaches the end of one of the strings, at which point the maximum similarity score is simply the length of the remaining string minus its own length;

dp[i][j] is the maximum similarity score for substrings of lengths i and j, where each cell only depends on previous cells along the diagonal or one row/column above it;
Build a 2D table to store the dynamic programming results; Start filling the table from the bottom-right corner (i.e., when both strings have ended); Initialize the base case as mentioned above;

For the rest of the cells, consider the maximum similarity score for substrings ending at characters A[i-1] and B[j-1]; This can be achieved by considering the LCS of these two characters; The number of common characters in this LCS is 4 times the length of the LCS minus the sum of the lengths of the remaining strings;
Continue filling the table from left to right, top to bottom;

Finally, return dp[0][0] as it represents the maximum similarity score for substrings of lengths 0 and 0 (i.e., empty strings);
This score is calculated by considering the LCS of the empty strings, which is also an empty string; The length of this LCS is 4 times its own length minus the sum of the lengths of the empty strings;
