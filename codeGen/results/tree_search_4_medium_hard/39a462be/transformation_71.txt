state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, j is the current index for string B, and k is the number of common characters found so far;
The base case is when there are no more common characters to find, at which point the maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common characters minus the total lengths of the strings.
i, j

Implement a recursive function that takes the current indices for strings A and B as input, and uses the base case to calculate the maximum similarity score when there are no more common characters to find.

state_expression = (i+1, j, k+1) if the current character in string A matches the current character in string B
state_expression = (i+1, j-1, k) otherwise

return 4 * k - i - j + 4 when there are no more common characters to find
