===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by building a suffix tree for both strings and then calculating the similarity score based on the number of nodes at the same level in the suffix trees.

state_expression = dp[i][j] where dp is a 2D table storing the maximum similarity scores for substrings of lengths i and j; 
The base case is when either i or j reaches the end of one of the strings, at which point the maximum similarity score is simply the length of the remaining string minus its own length.

dp[i][j] is the maximum similarity score for substrings of lengths i and j, where each cell only depends on previous cells along the diagonal or one row/column above it;

Applying memoization to cache and reuse previously computed values.

Feedback:
The plan is correct in identifying dynamic programming as a viable approach. However, building suffix trees might not be necessary. Instead, we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.

Improvement suggestions:
- Instead of using suffix trees, consider using a 2D table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum similarity score for substrings of lengths i and j.
- The base case should be modified to handle edge cases correctly. For example, when one string is longer than the other, we need to handle this case separately.

Potential issues with the plan:
- The plan doesn't explicitly mention handling edge cases such as when one string is longer than the other or when both strings are of length 1.
- It might be difficult to apply memoization correctly in this problem.

Edge cases:
The plan should explicitly handle edge cases such as when one string is longer than the other, and when both strings are of length 1. These edge cases can affect the maximum similarity score computation.
