===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to build a 2D table where each cell represents the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two substrings.

The state expression is a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the LCS of substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1]. The base case is when one or both strings are empty, in which case the LCS is an empty string.

dp[i][j] = max({
    0 (if A[i-1] != B[j-1]), 
    dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 (if A[i-1] == B[j-1])
})

Fill up the 2D table using a bottom-up approach, where each cell represents the LCS of two substrings.

The final answer is calculated as 4 * max({dp[n][m], dp[m][n]}) - (n + m)
