===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be viewed as a 2D DP table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings. The optimal substructure is the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two strings, which can be calculated using a 1D DP table.
Define a 2D DP table dp[m+1][n+1] where dp[i][j] represents the similarity score between substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1]. The state expression is:
    if i == 0 or j == 0: 
        return 0
    elif A[i-1] == B[j-1]:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 4
    else:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
Memoize the LCS calculation using a 1D DP table for each pair of substrings.
The maximal similarity score over all pairs of substrings is then the maximum value in the 2D DP table: 
    return max(max(row) for row in dp)
