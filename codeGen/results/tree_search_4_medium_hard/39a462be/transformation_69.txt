state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, j is the current index for string B, and k is the number of common characters found so far;
The base case is when there are no more common characters to find, at which point the maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common characters minus the total lengths of the strings.
i, j
Create a dynamic programming table with dimensions (n+1) x (m+1) to store the maximum similarity score at each position.
