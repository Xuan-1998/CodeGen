===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming without building a suffix tree for both strings.

state_expression = (i, j) where i is the current index for string A and j is the current index for string B; The state represents the similarity score up to the current indices.
Let dp[i][j] be a 2D array where i is the length of the substring of A ending at index i, j is the length of the substring of B ending at index j, and dp[i][j] stores the similarity score for these two substrings. The transition relationship would be:
    if the characters at indices i-1 in string A and j-1 in string B are equal, then dp[i][j] = 4 + dp[i-1][j-1].
    Otherwise, dp[i][j] is the maximum of 4 and dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1].

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to fill up the state_expression (i, j) for all possible combinations of substrings in both strings.

Let's initialize the base cases: dp[0][j] = -j and dp[i][0] = -i. This is because if the length of one string is 0, then the similarity score will be minus the length of the other string.

Then use the transition relationship to fill up the state_expression (i, j) for all possible combinations of substrings in both strings.
Finally, return dp[n][m] as the maximum similarity score over all pairs of substrings.
