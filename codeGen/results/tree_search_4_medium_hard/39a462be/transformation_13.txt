===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be viewed as a 2D DP table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings. The optimal substructure is the longest common subsequence of two strings, which can be calculated using a 1D DP table.

Let dp[i][j] be the similarity score for the substrings A[0..i] and B[0..j]. Then:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + (A[i-1] == B[j-1])

The base case is when one of i or j is 0. For example, if i is 0 then:

dp[0][j] = -j

Similarly, if j is 0 then:

dp[i][0] = -i

Use a dictionary to store the intermediate results and avoid recalculating the same subproblem multiple times.

To calculate dp[i][j], we need to consider three cases:
1. A[i-1] == B[j-1]: In this case, we add 4 to the similarity score of the substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1].

2. A[i-1] != B[j-1], but they have a common character: In this case, we don't add anything to the similarity score of the substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1].

3. They don't have a common character: In this case, we take the maximum of the similarity scores of the substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j], and A[0..i] and B[0..j-1].

Finally, calculate the maximal similarity score over all pairs of substrings by iterating through the DP table.
