The plan is mostly correct. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. Viewing the problem as a 2D DP table: Correct! The problem can indeed be viewed as a 2D DP table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings.

2. Defining the state expression: Mostly correct! The state expression is close, but it should include the case where the current characters don't match. This is crucial for correctly calculating the longest common subsequence.

3. Implementing memoization using recursion: Correct! Memoization can be used to store the calculated similarity scores and avoid redundant calculations.

However, there are a few potential issues with the plan:

1. Edge cases: The plan doesn't explicitly address edge cases such as when one or both strings are empty. These cases should be handled separately and correctly.

2. Time complexity: While the dynamic programming approach is correct, the time complexity of the current plan is O(m*n), which might be too slow for large inputs. To improve this, we can consider using a more efficient algorithm or data structure.

Here's an updated version of the detailed plan:
