state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, j is the current index for string B, and k is the number of common characters found so far; 
The base case is when there are no more common characters to find, at which point the maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common characters minus the total lengths of the strings.
For each possible pair of characters (a, b) from A[i] to B[j], if a == b then update k and move to the next pair of characters
state_expression = (i-1, j-1, k+1);

Use a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum similarity score for the first i characters of A and j characters of B.
