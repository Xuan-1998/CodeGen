The problem can be solved by building a suffix tree for both strings and then calculating the similarity score based on the number of nodes at the same level in the suffix trees.

state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, j is the current index for string B, and k is the number of common characters found so far; The base case is when there are no more common characters to find, at which point the maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common characters minus the total lengths of the strings.

state_transition = {
    (i, j, k): 
        if i < len(A) and j < len(B) and A[i] == B[j]:
            return (i+1, j+1, k+1)
        else:
            return None
}

dp = {}
for i in range(len(A)):
    for j in range(len(B)):
        dp[(i, j)] = state_transition((i, j, 0))
        if dp[(i, j)] is not None:
            dp[(i, j)] = (dp[(i, j)][0], dp[(i, j)][1], dp[(i, j)][2] + 1)
        else:
            dp[(i, j)] = (0, 0, 0)

max_similarity = 0
for k in range(max(len(A), len(B))):
    for i in range(len(A) - k):
        for j in range(len(B) - k):
            if dp[(i, j)][2] == k:
                max_similarity = max(max_similarity, 4*k - (len(A) + len(B)))

print(max_similarity)
