The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming and building a 2D table to store the maximum similarity scores for substrings of different lengths.

state_expression = dp[i][j] where dp is a 2D table storing the maximum similarity scores for substrings of lengths i and j; The base case is when either i or j reaches the end of one of the strings, at which point the maximum similarity score is simply the length of the remaining string minus its own length.

dp[i][0] = dp[0][j] = 4 * (min(i, len(B)) - j) where B is the shorter string; 

Use dynamic programming to build a 2D table where state_expression = dp[i][j] represents the maximum similarity score for substrings of lengths i and j.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k] + dp[k][j-1] - k) for all k from 0 to min(i, j);

The maximum value in the table is the answer.
