===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be viewed as a 2D DP table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings. The optimal substructure is the longest common subsequence of two strings, which can be calculated using a 1D DP table.

To calculate the state expression dp[i][j], we need to consider the longest common subsequence (LCS) of A[0..i] and B[0..j]. We can use a hybrid approach that combines top-down dynamic programming with memoization to efficiently compute this LCS. The state expression is dp[i][j] = 4 * len(LCS(A[0..i], B[0..j])) - (i + j).

The base case is when one of i or j is 0, in which case the similarity score is simply the length of the longer string minus its length. This can be handled separately from the recursive case.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + (A[i-1] == B[j-1]), dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

This plan should correctly calculate the maximal similarity score over all pairs of substrings. It includes edge cases by handling the base case separately.

One potential issue with this plan is that it may not be efficient for large inputs, as it involves a lot of repeated calculations. This could potentially be improved using a more efficient algorithm or data structure.
