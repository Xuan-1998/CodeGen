state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, 
                          j is the current index for string B, and 
                          k is the number of common characters found so far; 

The base case is when there are no more common characters to find, at which point 
the maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common characters minus 
the total lengths of the strings.

Use memoization to cache the results of expensive function calls and avoid 
redundant computations.

Build a suffix tree for both strings A and B using Ukkonen's algorithm or 
the Suffix Tree Construction Algorithm by Weiner. This will help in efficiently 
finding common substrings between the two strings.

Calculate the similarity score based on the number of nodes at the same level 
in the suffix trees. This can be done by iterating through the levels of the 
suffix trees and comparing the nodes at each level. For each pair of nodes, if 
they are the same then increment a counter for that level.

The maximum similarity score will be 4 times the length of the longest common 
subsequence minus the total lengths of the strings.

Return the maximum similarity score as the final answer.
