===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by using Dynamic Programming with Suffix Trees.

state_expression = dp[i][j] where dp is a 2D table storing the maximum similarity scores for substrings of lengths i and j;
The base case is when either i or j reaches the end of one of the strings, at which point the maximum similarity score is simply the length of the remaining string minus its own length.

dp[i][j] is the maximum similarity score for substrings of lengths i and j, where each cell only depends on previous cells along the diagonal or one row/column above it;
Using a dynamic programming table to store the maximum similarity scores for substrings of different lengths.
Build Suffix Trees for both strings A and B;
Calculate the number of nodes at the same level in the suffix trees;
Use this information to calculate the similarity score based on the number of nodes at the same level in the suffix trees.
