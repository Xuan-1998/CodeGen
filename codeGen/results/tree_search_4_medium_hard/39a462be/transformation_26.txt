The problem can be solved by building a suffix tree for both strings and then calculating the similarity score based on the number of nodes at the same level in the suffix trees.

state_expression = (i, j) where i is the current index for string A and j is the current index for string B; The state represents the similarity score up to the current indices.
Let state be a 2D array dp[i][j] where i is the length of the substring of A ending at index i, j is the length of the substring of B ending at index j, and dp[i][j] stores the similarity score for these two substrings.

The transition relationship would be: if the characters at indices i-1 in string A and j-1 in string B are equal, then dp[i][j] = 4 + dp[i-1][j-1]. Otherwise, dp[i][j] is the maximum of 4 and dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1].

Utilize memoization with a 2D array dp[i][j] to tabulate the transition relationships for each pair of characters at indices i-1 in string A and j-1 in string B.

For initialization, set dp[0][j] = 0 for all j and dp[i][0] = 0 for all i. This represents the similarity score for the empty strings.

To calculate the final answer, iterate over the last row of dp (i.e., dp[n][*]) or the last column of dp (i.e., dp[*][m]), depending on whether you want to consider only substrings from string A or only substrings from string B. The maximum value in this row/column would be the final answer.
