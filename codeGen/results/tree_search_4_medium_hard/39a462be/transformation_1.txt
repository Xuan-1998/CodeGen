===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be viewed as a 2D DP table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings. The optimal substructure is the longest common subsequence of two strings, which can be calculated using a 1D DP table.

Let state dp[i][j] represent the similarity score between substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1]. The base case is when either i or j is 0, in which case the similarity score is 0.

The recursive formula for dp[i][j] can be written as:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + (min(i-1, j-1) == 0 ? 4 : 4 - min(i-1, j-1)) if A[i-1] == B[j-1] else dp[i-1][j] or dp[i][j-1])

The maximum similarity score can be found by iterating over the DP table and returning the maximum value.

To use memoization to store the results of costly function calls involving longest common subsequences, you can create a dictionary that maps tuples of indices i and j to their corresponding similarity scores.
