===BEGIN PLAN===
state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, j is the current index for string B, and k is the number of common characters found so far;
The base case is when there are no more common characters to find, at which point the maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common characters minus the total lengths of the strings.

Transition
memoization_with_dictionary = {i: {j: (k, maximum_similarity_score) for j in range(m+1)} for i in range(n+1)}

Memoization:
- Initialize a dictionary memo with dimensions n*m to store maximum similarity scores.
- For each possible pair (i, j) of indices in strings A and B, calculate the maximum similarity score as 4 times the length of common characters minus total lengths of strings.
- Store this value in the memo dictionary.

Memoization_with_dictionary:
- Create a dictionary memo with dimensions n*m to store maximum similarity scores for all possible prefixes of both strings.
- Initialize the memo dictionary with base case values: (i, j, k) = 4 times length of common characters minus total lengths of strings when there are no more common characters to find.

Memoization_with_dictionary:
state_expression = (i, j, k)
memo[i][j] = max(0, k + 4 * len(common_chars(A[:i], B[:j])) - i - j)

Memoization_with_dictionary:
- For all possible pairs of substrings, calculate maximum similarity score based on length of common characters and lengths of strings.
- Store this value in memo dictionary.

Memoization_with_dictionary:
state_expression = (i, j, k)
memo[i][j] = max(memo[i-1][j-1], memo[i-1][j], memo[i][j-1])

Memoization_with_dictionary:
- Calculate maximum similarity score for a pair of substrings based on the scores of similar prefixes.
- Store this value in memo dictionary.

Memoization_with_dictionary:
state_expression = (i, j, k)
maximum_similarity_score = max((k + 4 * len(common_chars(A[:i], B[:j])) - i - j) for i in range(n+1) for j in range(m+1))

Memoization_with_dictionary:
- Calculate maximum similarity score over all pairs of substrings.
- Return this value as the solution.

Memoization_with_dictionary:
state_expression = (i, j, k)
return maximum_similarity_score
