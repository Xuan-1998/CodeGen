===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be viewed as a 2D DP table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings. The optimal substructure is the longest common subsequence of two strings, which can be calculated using a 1D DP table.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = 4 * len(lcs(A[0..i], B[0..j])) - (i + j), and the base case is when one of i or j is 0.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + (A[i-1] == B[j-1]), dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

To implement memoization, use a dictionary to store and reuse previously computed values of the 2D DP table.

For each pair of substrings, compute their LCS using the same 1D DP approach. Then calculate the similarity score based on the length of the LCS.

Finally, iterate over all pairs of substrings, calculate their similarity scores, and keep track of the maximum score seen so far.
