The problem can be solved by building a suffix tree for both strings and then calculating the similarity score based on the number of nodes at the same level in the suffix trees.

state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, j is the current index for string B, and k is the number of common characters found so far;

The base case is when there are no more common characters to find, at which point the maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common characters minus the total lengths of the strings.

s1, s2, k

Implement memoization by defining a recursive function that uses a dictionary to store previously computed values and avoid redundant calculations.

state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, j is the current index for string B, and k is the number of common characters found so far;

The updated state expression should include the number of common characters found so far, as well as the indices for both strings.
