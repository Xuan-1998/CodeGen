===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to build a 2D table where each cell represents the LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) between two substrings. The state expression is the pair of substrings, and the base case is when one or both strings are empty.

The state expression is a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the LCS of substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1]. The base case is when one or both strings are empty, in which case the LCS is an empty string.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) if A[i-1] == B[j-1], else dp[i-1][j-1].

Use a 2D table with dimensions (n+1) x (m+1) to store the LCS for all possible substrings. The similarity score between two strings is then calculated as 4 times the length of their LCS minus the sum of their lengths.

To improve this plan, we can add edge cases such as when one or both strings are empty, in which case the LCS is an empty string and the similarity score is 0.

The potential issue with this plan is that it does not handle the case where one or both strings are empty. We need to include these edge cases to ensure our solution works correctly for all possible inputs.

Here is the updated version of the plan:
