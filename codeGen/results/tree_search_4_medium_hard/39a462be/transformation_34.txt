===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by building a suffix tree for both strings and then calculating the similarity score based on the number of nodes at the same level in the suffix trees.

state_expression = dp[i][j] where dp is a 2D table storing the maximum similarity scores for substrings of lengths i and j;
The base case is when either i or j reaches the end of one of the strings, at which point the maximum similarity score is simply the length of the remaining string minus its own length.

dp[i][j] represents the maximum similarity score for substrings of lengths i and j, with dp[0][j] being the length of string A minus j, and similarly for dp[i][0];

Use memoization to store the maximum similarity scores for substrings of lengths i and j in a dictionary, with state_expression = dp[i][j].

The updated plan includes edge cases for strings of different lengths. For example, when one string is much longer than the other, the maximum similarity score will be achieved by matching the shorter string to the end of the longer string.

Here's an improved version of the plan:

Initialize a 2D table dp with dimensions (n+1) x (m+1), where n and m are the lengths of strings A and B respectively. Set all entries in the first row or column to 0, since these represent the maximum similarity scores for substrings that extend beyond one of the strings.

For each entry dp[i][j] in the table, calculate its value as follows:
- If i or j is 0, set dp[i][j] = max(0, min(i, j)), which represents the base case where either string has been fully matched.
- Otherwise, consider all substrings of length i and j that end at position i in A and j in B. Calculate their similarity scores by summing the lengths of these substrings minus 4 times the length of their LCS. Keep track of the maximum similarity score among these substrings.

The final answer is stored in dp[n][m], which represents the maximum similarity score for all possible pairs of substrings.

This plan should correctly calculate the maximum similarity score and handle edge cases.
