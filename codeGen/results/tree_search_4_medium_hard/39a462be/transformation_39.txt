The problem can be solved by building a suffix tree for both strings and then calculating the similarity score based on the number of nodes at the same level in the suffix trees.

state_expression = dp[i][j] where dp is a 2D table storing the maximum similarity scores for substrings of lengths i and j; The base case is when either i or j reaches the end of one of the strings, at which point the maximum similarity score is simply the length of the remaining string minus its own length.

dp[i][j] is the maximum similarity score for substrings of lengths i and j, where transitions depend on matching/mismatching characters between the current position in strings A and B

Using a dynamic programming table to store the maximum similarity scores for substrings of lengths i and j. For each cell dp[i][j], consider all possible substrings of lengths i-1 and j-1 that end at the current position in both strings, and update dp[i][j] based on whether these substrings match or mismatch.

The updated plan includes edge cases: when either i or j reaches the end of one of the strings, the maximum similarity score is calculated as described above. When neither i nor j reaches the end of a string, consider all possible matching/mismatching characters between the current position in both strings and update dp[i][j] accordingly.

The plan avoids potential issues by considering all possible substrings of lengths i-1 and j-1 that end at the current position in both strings. This ensures that all possible combinations of matching/mismatching characters are considered when updating the maximum similarity score.
