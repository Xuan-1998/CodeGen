===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be viewed as a 2D DP table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings. The optimal substructure is the longest common subsequence of two strings, which can be calculated using a 1D DP table.

Define a 2D DP table dp[m+1][n+1] where dp[i][j] represents the similarity score between substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1]. The state expression is:
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1] + 4) if i > 0 and j > 0,
otherwise it's 0.

The base case is when either i or j is 0. Initialize dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, and dp[i][0] = 0 for all i.

Use the DP table to compute the similarity score between the entire strings A and B: max(dp[m][n], dp[m][0] + m, dp[0][n] + n).

Define a hash map to store the longest common subsequences of substrings and their lengths, then compute the maximum score by iterating over the stored values.

Compute the maximum similarity score by iterating over all possible pairs of substrings: for each i in range(m+1) and each j in range(n+1), check if dp[i][j] is greater than the current maximum score. If so, update the maximum score.
