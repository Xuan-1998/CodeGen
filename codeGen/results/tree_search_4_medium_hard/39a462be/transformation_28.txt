===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by building a 2D table where each cell represents the similarity score up to the current indices in string A and B.

state_expression = (i, j) where i is the current index for string A and j is the current index for string B; The state represents the similarity score up to the current indices.

Let state be a tuple (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, j is the current index for string B, and k is the length of the longest common subsequence found so far. The transition relationship would be: if the characters at indices i in string A and j in string B are equal, then (i+1, j+1, max(k, 1)). Otherwise, it's the tuple with the maximum value of k.

The plan can be updated as follows:

- Initialize a table dp with dimensions (n+1) x (m+1) where n and m are the lengths of strings A and B respectively.
- Fill up the base cases by iterating over all indices i from 0 to n and j from 0 to m. If characters at indices i in string A and j in string B are equal, then dp[i+1][j+1] = max(dp[i+1][j+1], k+1) where k is the length of the longest common subsequence found so far.
- Use nested loops to iterate over all states (i, j, k) in the table. If characters at indices i in string A and j in string B are equal, then dp[i+1][j+1] = max(dp[i+1][j+1], k+1). Otherwise, dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i+1][j].
- The maximum similarity score can be found by iterating over the last row of the table.
