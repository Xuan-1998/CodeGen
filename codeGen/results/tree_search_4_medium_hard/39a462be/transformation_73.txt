===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by building a suffix tree for both strings and then calculating the similarity score based on the number of nodes at the same level in the suffix trees.

state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, j is the current index for string B, and k is the number of common characters found so far; The base case is when there are no more common characters to find, at which point the maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common characters minus the total lengths of the strings.

Transition
Use memoization with a dictionary to cache previously computed state expressions and their maximum similarity scores. However, this approach may not be efficient as it requires building suffix trees for both strings.

Instead, use dynamic programming to build a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum similarity score up to i characters in string A and j characters in string B.

state_expression = (i, j) where i is the current index for string A and j is the current index for string B.

Transition
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + 4 if strings A and B match at character i and j, dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

Base case
dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = -i-j (since the maximum similarity score is 0 when one string ends)

Memoization
Use a dictionary to cache previously computed state expressions and their maximum similarity scores.

Final answer
Return the maximum value in the dp array.
