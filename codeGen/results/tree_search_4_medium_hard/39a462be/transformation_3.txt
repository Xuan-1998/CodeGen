===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be viewed as a 2D DP table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings. The optimal substructure is the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two strings, which can be calculated using a 1D DP table.

Let state dp[i][j] represent the similarity score between substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1]. The base case is when either i or j is 0, in which case the similarity score is 0. The recurrence relation for dp[i][j] is:

dp[i][j] = min(
    dp[i-1][j-1] + 4*length_of_lcs(A[0..i-1], B[0..j-1]),
    dp[i-1][j],
    dp[i][j-1]
)

The idea is to fill the DP table row by row, where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings. The LCS of A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1] can be calculated using a 1D DP table.

Create a 2D DP table with dimensions n+1 by m+1, where n is the length of string A and m is the length of string B. The maximum value in the DP table represents the maximal similarity score over all pairs of substrings.

The plan does not include edge cases, but it can be easily modified to handle them. For example, when i or j is 0, we set dp[i][j] = 0 as there are no common characters between two empty strings.
