===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to build a 2D table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings. The state expression is the pair of substrings, and the base case is when one or both strings are empty.

The state expression is a 3D array dp[i][j][k] where dp[i][j][k] represents the LCS length of A[0..i-k] and B[0..j-k]. The base case is when one or both strings are empty, in which case the similarity score is calculated as the sum of lengths minus 4 times the length of the shorter string.

Use a 2D table dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] is the similarity score between substrings A[0..i] and B[0..j]. Initialize dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] with base cases, then fill in the rest of the table using dynamic programming.

Let's say we have two strings A and B. We can iterate through all possible pairs of substrings A[i-k..i-1] and B[j-k..j-1]. For each pair, calculate the LCS length and update the dp[i][j] value accordingly.

To improve this plan, we could also consider pre-calculating some base cases to reduce the number of calculations needed during the dynamic programming step. Additionally, we should handle edge cases such as when one or both strings are empty.

The potential issue with this plan is that it might be slow for large inputs due to the 3D array dp[i][j][k] and the number of calculations required. However, if we use a more efficient algorithm or pre-calculate some values, this could be mitigated.

The updated version of the plan includes all necessary steps and handles edge cases:
