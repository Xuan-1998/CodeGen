===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be viewed as a 2D DP table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings. The optimal substructure is the longest common subsequence of two strings, which can be calculated using a 1D DP table.

Define a 3D DP table dp[i][j][k] to store the maximum similarity score for strings A[0..i], B[0..j] with k characters in their LCS.
The state expression is:
dp[i][j][k] = max(dp[i-1][j-1][min(k, len(lcs(A[0..i], B[0..j])))] + (A[i-1] == B[j-1]),
dp[i-1][j][k],
dp[i][j-1][k])

The base case is when i or j is 0.

Use a set or list to store the lengths of common subsequences for each pair of characters and update them accordingly.
