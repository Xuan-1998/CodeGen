The problem can be solved by building a suffix tree for both strings and then calculating the similarity score based on the number of nodes at the same level in the suffix trees.

state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, j is the current index for string B, and k is the number of common characters found so far; The base case is when there are no more common characters to find, at which point the maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common characters minus the total lengths of the strings.

states = []
for i in range(len(A)):
    for j in range(len(B)):
        if A[i] == B[j]:
            k += 1
            states.append((i, j, k))
        else:
            k = 0

max_similarity = 0
for (i, j, k) in states:
    if k > 0:
        max_similarity = max(max_similarity, 4 * k - len(A) - len(B))

return max_similarity
