===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by building a dynamic programming table to store the similarity scores of substrings and then calculating the maximal similarity score based on this table.

state_expression = (i, j) where i is the current index for string A and j is the current index for string B; The base case is when there are no more characters to consider, at which point the maximum similarity score is 0. 

For each possible substring of string A and B, calculate the similarity score as 4 times the length of the longest common subsequence minus the sum of the lengths of the substrings.

Implement a bottom-up approach using a dictionary to store the similarity scores of substrings.

1. Initialize a table dp of size (n+1) x (m+1) where n and m are the lengths of strings A and B respectively, with all elements initially set to 0.
2. For each character in string A and B from left to right:
   - If the characters at the current indices match, then update the dp table by setting the value at state (i+1, j+1) as follows: 
     - If i == n or j == m, set the value as 0. Otherwise, calculate the similarity score of the longest common subsequence ending at this position and add it to the value at state (i-1, j-1).
   - If the characters do not match, then update the dp table by setting the value at state (i+1, j) or state (i, j+1) as follows: 
     - If i == n, set the value at state (i, j+1) as 0. Otherwise, calculate the similarity score of the longest common subsequence ending at this position and add it to the value at state (i-1, j).
     - Similarly, if j == m, set the value at state (i+1, j) as 0. Otherwise, calculate the similarity score of the longest common subsequence ending at this position and add it to the value at state (i, j-1).

3. The maximum similarity score is stored in dp[n][m].
