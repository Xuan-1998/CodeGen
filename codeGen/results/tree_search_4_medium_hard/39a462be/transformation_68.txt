===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming with a 2D array instead of building suffix trees.

state_expression = (i, j) where i is the current index for string A and j is the current index for string B; The base case is when there are no more characters to compare at which point the maximum similarity score is calculated as follows: 4 times the length of LCS plus the sum of lengths of remaining parts in both strings.

State
Tabulation using a 2D array to store the maximum similarity score at each index

Transition:
- If A[i] == B[j], then there are more common characters found, and the state is updated as follows: (i - 1, j - 1, length of LCS + 1); 
- Else, the state remains the same.

Base Case
- When i or j is less than 0, return 4 times the length of LCS minus the sum of lengths of remaining parts in both strings. 

The maximum similarity score over all pairs of substrings is stored at the last cell of the 2D array.
