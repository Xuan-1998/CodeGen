state_expression = (i, j)

The state represents the similarity score up to the current indices.

Let state be a dictionary d where key is the pair of substrings and value is their similarity score.

Transition relationship:

1. Initialize dp with size n+1 x m+1 x max_length
   - Fill dp[0][0][0] with a base case value (e.g., 0)

2. For each substring of A and B:
   - Calculate the LCS for the current substring
   - Update dp[i][j][k] by considering the LCS and the similarity score from the previous state

3. The maximum similarity score is stored in dp[n][m][max_length]

Potential issues with the plan:

1. Handling edge cases: 
   - What happens when i or j reaches 0? (Consider setting base case values)
   - How do we handle strings A and B of length 0?

2. Optimizations:
   - Can we reduce the number of calculations by only considering k-length common subsequences where k is within a certain range?

3. Computational complexity:
   - The plan might have high computational complexity due to the 3D table and nested calculations.

4. Edge cases: 
   - What about strings A and B that are identical or almost identical? How do we handle these cases?

Improved version:

1. Initialize dp with a base case value for edge cases (e.g., 0 when i, j, or k reaches 0)

2. Use memoization to reduce calculations by storing intermediate results

3. Optimize the plan by considering only relevant k-length common subsequences
