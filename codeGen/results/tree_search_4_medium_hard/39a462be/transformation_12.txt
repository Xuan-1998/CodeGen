===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be viewed as a 2D DP table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings. The optimal substructure is the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two strings, which can be calculated using a 1D DP table.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = max(4 * len(lcs(A[0..i-1], B[0..j-1])) - (i + j), dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]) for i, j > 0. The base case is when one of i or j is 0.
dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 0
The goal is to find the maximum similarity score in the table.

Use a 2D DP table to store the state of each cell and calculate the similarity score in a bottom-up manner. Start by initializing the base case values for the first row or column, then fill in the rest of the table based on the recurrence relation.
The final answer is the maximum value in the last cell of the table.
