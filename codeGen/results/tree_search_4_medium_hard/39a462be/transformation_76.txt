===BEGIN PLAN===
state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, j is the current index for string B, and k is the number of common characters found so far;
The base case is when there are no more common characters to find, at which point the maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common characters minus the total lengths of the strings.

For each possible index i for string A and j for string B:
    Check if characters at indices i and j are the same. If they are:
        Move to the next pair of characters
    If not, calculate the maximum similarity score based on the current state expression (i, j, k) by considering all previous common characters found
    Use memoization with a recursive function to cache intermediate results

Calculate the final maximum similarity score by iterating through all possible pairs of substrings and keeping track of the maximum score found
