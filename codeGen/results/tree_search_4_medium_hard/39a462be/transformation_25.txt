state_expression = (i, j) where i is the current index for string A and j is the current index for string B; The state represents the similarity score up to the current indices.

Let dp be a 2D array of size m+1 * n+1 where m is the length of string A and n is the length of string B. Let's initialize it with zeros.

The transition relationship would be: if the characters at indices i-1 in string A and j-1 in string B are equal, then dp[i][j] = 4 + dp[i-1][j-1]. If they're not equal, dp[i][j] is the maximum of 4 and dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1].

To improve this plan, we can use memoization using a dictionary to store and reuse previously computed similarity scores between substring pairs. This would reduce the time complexity from O(m*n) to O(m+n).

Let's also handle edge cases: if i or j is zero, it means that the current substring is empty, so we return 0 as the similarity score.

Here's an updated version of the plan:

state_expression = (i, j)
where i is the current index for string A and j is the current index for string B
The state represents the similarity score up to the current indices

Let dp be a 2D array of size m+1 * n+1 where m is the length of string A and n is the length of string B
Let's initialize it with zeros

state = (i, j)
if i or j is zero, return 0 as the similarity score

transition relationship:
if characters at indices i-1 in string A and j-1 in string B are equal:
dp[i][j] = 4 + dp[i-1][j-1]
else:
dp[i][j] is the maximum of 4 and dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1]
