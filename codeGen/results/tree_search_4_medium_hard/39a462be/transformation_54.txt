===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by building a suffix tree for both strings and then calculating the similarity score based on the number of nodes at the same level in the suffix trees.

state_expression = (i, j, k) where i is the current index for string A, j is the current index for string B, and k is the number of common characters found so far; The base case is when there are no more common characters to find, at which point the maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common characters minus the total lengths of the strings.

state:
Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum similarity score for substrings ending at index i in string A and j in string B. 

Fill up the base case first, then fill up the rest of the dp table using dynamic programming, starting from the smallest substrings and working our way up.

For each cell dp[i][j], if the current characters in both strings match, then there are three possibilities: 
1) The maximum similarity score is the same as the one for the smaller substrings (i-1, j-1), or
2) The maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the common substring plus the dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1], or
3) The maximum similarity score is 4 times the length of the longest common subsequence of A[:i] and B[:j] minus i+j.

The answer will be stored in dp[n][m].
