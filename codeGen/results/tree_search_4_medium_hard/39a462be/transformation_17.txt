===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be viewed as a 2D DP table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings. The optimal substructure is the longest common subsequence of two strings, which can be calculated using a 1D DP table.

Define a 2D DP table dp[m+1][n+1] where dp[i][j] represents the similarity score between substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1]. The state transition is:
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + (A[i-1] == B[j-1]) * 4, dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

The base case is when either i or j is 0: dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 0 for all i and j.

To get the final answer, we need to calculate the maximum similarity score over all pairs of substrings. The maximum similarity score can be found by iterating over the last row and column of the DP table:
max_similarity = max(dp[m][k] - k for k in range(n+1)) + 4 * max(len(A) - m, len(B) - n)
