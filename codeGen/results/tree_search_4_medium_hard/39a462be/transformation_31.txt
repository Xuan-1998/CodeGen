state_expression = (i, j) where i is the current index for string A and j is the current index for string B; 
The state represents the similarity score up to the current indices.

Let state be a dictionary d where key is the pair of substrings and value is their similarity score.
The transition relationship would be: 
for each substring of A and B, calculate the LCS using dynamic programming (DP) and update the dictionary with the new similarity score. 

state_transition = (
  for i in range(len(A)):
    for j in range(len(B)):
      current_state = state.get((i, j), 0)
      lcs_length = len(lcs(A[i:], B[j:]))
      next_state = (4 * lcs_length) - (len(A[i:]) + len(B[j:]))
      state[(i, j)] = max(current_state, next_state)

return max(state.values())
