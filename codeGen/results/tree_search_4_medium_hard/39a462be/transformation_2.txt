===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be viewed as a 2D DP table where each cell represents the similarity score between two substrings. The optimal substructure is the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two strings, which can be calculated using a 1D DP table.
Let state dp[i][j] represent the similarity score between substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1]. The base case is when either i or j is 0, in which case the similarity score is 0.

dp[i][j] represents the maximum similarity score for substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..j-1].
To implement dynamic programming by using a bottom-up approach where smaller subproblems are solved first, we can iterate over all possible substrings of A and B and fill up the 2D DP table.

For each cell dp[i][j], we need to calculate its value based on previous cells. The similarity score is calculated as 4 times the length of the LCS minus the sum of i and j.
The LCS can be calculated using a 1D DP table where state dp[k] represents the maximum length of LCS for substrings A[0..i-1] and B[0..k]. We can fill up this 1D DP table by iterating over all possible substrings of A and B.

After filling up both tables, we can calculate the final answer as the maximum value in the 2D DP table.
This plan includes edge cases where i or j is 0, which are correctly handled.
