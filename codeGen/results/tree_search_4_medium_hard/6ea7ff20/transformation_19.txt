===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

Let dp[i][j] be True if p[:i] is the merge of two arrays, each with j elements, and False otherwise. Initialize a 2D table dp of size (2*n+1) x n where dp[i][j] represents whether a prefix of length i in the permutation can be merged into two arrays, each with j elements.

The base case is when j=0, meaning we're considering an empty array. In this case, check if the remaining elements in the permutation match array b. If they do, set dp[i][j] to True for all i > j, indicating that a prefix of length i can be merged into two arrays with j elements.

The recursive case is when j>0 and we're considering an element p[i-1]. There are two possibilities: either the current element belongs to array a or array b. If it belongs to array a, then consider all possible merges where the current element is part of array a. Set dp[i][j] to True if any such merge is possible. Similarly, if the current element belongs to array b, set dp[i][j] to True if any merge where the current element is part of array b is possible.

To avoid checking the same subproblem multiple times, use memoization by storing the results in a dictionary or a 2D table and only calculating each value once.

The final answer will be dp[2*n][n]. If this value is True, then it's possible to merge the permutation into two arrays with n elements. Otherwise, return False.
