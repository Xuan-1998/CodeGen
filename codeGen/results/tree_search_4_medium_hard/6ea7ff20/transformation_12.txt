===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

State: A tuple (i, a, b) representing the current index and the arrays we have processed so far. The state also includes two booleans, one indicating whether the previous element was from array a and the other indicating whether the previous element was from array b.

Transition: 
    1. If i is equal to n, return "YES" if p matches either array or both are empty.
    2. Otherwise, consider the next element pi in the permutation. 
       - If pi is less than both a[i-1] and b[j-1], add pi to p, update a and b accordingly (by removing the smallest element from the corresponding array), and recursively call the function with the updated state.
       - If pi is greater than or equal to both a[i-1] and b[j-1], swap the arrays if necessary, then add pi to p, remove the largest element from the corresponding array, and recursively call the function with the updated state.
    3. Memoize the result.

Base case: When i=n, return "YES" if p matches either array or both are empty.

Edge cases:
    - If n is less than 1, return "NO", as there are no valid arrays to match the permutation.
    - If pi is not within the range [0,2n-1], consider it an error and return "NO".

Hybrid tabulation and memoization: Combine the benefits of both approaches by using memoization for overlapping subproblems. This will significantly reduce the computation time.

Return "YES" if there exists a pair of arrays that matches the permutation; otherwise, return "NO".
