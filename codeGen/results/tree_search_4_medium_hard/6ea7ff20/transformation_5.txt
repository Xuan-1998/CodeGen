===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

Let dp[i][j] represent whether there exist arrays a and b, each of length i and with no elements in common, so that p=merge(a,b) up to the i-th element. We can initialize dp[0][0] = 1, indicating that an empty array can always be merged without common elements.

For i > 0, we have two cases:

1. The current element p[i-1] is from a. In this case, dp[i][j] should only depend on whether the previous i-1 elements could be merged without common elements, which is represented as dp[i-1][k], where k is some integer.

2. The current element p[i-1] is from b. Similarly, dp[i][j] should only depend on whether the previous i-1 elements could be merged without common elements, which is also represented as dp[i-1][k].

We can use a single variable max_length to track the maximum length of arrays that can be merged without common elements, and update it accordingly in each iteration.

Let's iterate over all possible pairs of arrays a and b, each with length up to i. For each pair, check if p[:i] is equal to merge(a,b)[:i]. If yes, then we have found a valid pair, and we can update max_length accordingly.

Finally, the answer is "YES" if max_length equals 2n, and "NO" otherwise.
