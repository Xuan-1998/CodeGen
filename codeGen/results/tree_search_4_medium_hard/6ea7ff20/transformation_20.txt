===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

Let's define dp[i][j] as True if p[:i] is the merge of two arrays, each with j elements, and False otherwise. We'll use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Base case: When j=0, we're considering an empty array. In this case, check if the remaining elements in the permutation match array b. If they do, return True; otherwise, return False.

Recursive case: For i > 0 and j > 0, consider the following cases:

* If p[i-1] < p[j-1], it means we can "remove" the first element of a and "add" the first element of b to get the current permutation. In this case, recursively check if dp[i-1][j-1] is True, and return the result.
* If p[i-1] > p[j-1], it means we can "remove" the first element of b and "add" the first element of a to get the current permutation. Again, recursively check if dp[i-1][j-1] is True, and return the result.
* If p[i-1] == p[j-1], it means the first elements of both arrays are the same. In this case, we can't "remove" or "add" anything yet, so recursively call dp[i-2][j-2] and check if the result is True.

Memoize the recursive function to avoid redundant calculations. Start from the base case (j=0) and fill up the dp table in a bottom-up manner.

Edge cases: Make sure to handle edge cases where i or j is 0 correctly.
