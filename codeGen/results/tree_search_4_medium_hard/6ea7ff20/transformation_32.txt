===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

The base case is when i=n and j=0, meaning we've reached the end of both arrays. In this case, return true if p is empty or if a and b are empty sets.

State: dp as a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents whether the permutation p up to index i can be generated by merging two arrays of length j and n-j. Initialize all values in dp as false.
Transition relationship: 
    - If i<n, then dp[i][j] = false
    - If i=n, then dp[n][0] = true if p is empty or if a and b are empty sets

Apply memoization to store the results of subproblems as you solve them.

Iterate over all possible values of j from 0 to n. For each value of j, consider all possible elements for the first array of length j.
    - If the permutation p up to index i can be generated by merging two arrays of length j and n-j, then dp[i][j] = True
    - Otherwise, dp[i][j] = False

Finally, return dp[n][n-1]
