===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about how you can use memoization to avoid solving the same subproblem multiple times and store the results in a table for later reference.

Let dp[i][j] be 1 if there exists two arrays a and b, each of length n-1, such that p=merge(a,b), where i and j are the indices in p. Define dp[i][j] as follows:

    - If p[i]<p[j], then dp[i][j]=1+dp[i+1][j]
    - If p[i]>p[j], then dp[i][j]=1+dp[i][j-1]

Create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the existence of two arrays a and b, each of length n-1, such that p=merge(a,b).

The base case is when i=j, meaning we've processed all elements in p. In this case, we can simply return YES if there's at least one pair of indices with different values. Otherwise, return NO.

For the state transitions, consider two cases:

    - If p[i]<p[j], then we know a must have an element less than p[i] and b must have an element greater than p[i]. So, dp[i][j]=1+dp[i+1][j]
    - If p[i]>p[j], then we know a must have an element greater than p[j] and b must have an element less than p[j]. So, dp[i][j]=1+dp[i][j-1]

The state transition is based on the comparison of p[i] and p[j].
