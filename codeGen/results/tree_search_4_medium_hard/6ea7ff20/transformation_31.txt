===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

State: a and b as sets; Transition relationship: dp[i][j] = True if p[:i+j+1] is empty, meaning we've reached the end of both arrays. In this case, return true if p is empty.

The base case is when i=0 or j=0, meaning one of the arrays has ended. In this case, return false, as it's not possible to merge arrays with different lengths.

Transition relationship: 
- dp[i][j] = True if p[:i+j+1] is empty
- If p[i]=p[j], then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
- If i<j and p[i]=a[n-1], then dp[i][j] = False
- If j<i and p[j]=b[m-1], then dp[i][j] = False

Use dynamic programming with bottom-up approach, where you fill up the table in a linear fashion. Initialize dp as a 2D array of size (n+1)*(n+1) filled with False.
