===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

The base case is when i=n, meaning we've reached the end of the permutation. In this case, check if the current permutation p matches either array a or b.

The state is the current permutation p up to index i, and the transition is adding the next element from either array a or b to p.

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a table with all zeros, where each cell represents the maximum length of arrays a and b that can be merged to form the permutation up to index i.

To improve this plan, we can consider using a more efficient data structure than a 2D array. We could use a hashmap or a binary search tree to store the subproblems and their solutions.

The potential issues with this plan are:

* Edge cases: What if n is very large? How will we handle this?
* Time complexity: Will our solution be efficient enough for large values of n?

To address these concerns, we could consider using a more advanced data structure or algorithm to solve the problem.

Here's an updated version of the plan that addresses these concerns:
