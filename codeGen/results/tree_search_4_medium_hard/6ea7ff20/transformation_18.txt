===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

The base case is when j=0, meaning we're considering an empty array. In this case, check if the remaining elements in the permutation match array b.

Define dp[i][j] as a boolean indicating whether there exist arrays a and b such that p[:i]=merge(a,b) and |a|=j.

Let's define two base cases: 
- When j=0 (empty array), dp[i][0] is True if the remaining elements in the permutation match array b.
- When i=2n, dp[2n][j] is False for all j, since there are no more elements to consider.

For the recursive case, consider the following: 
- If p[i-1]<p[i], then we can split the problem into two subproblems:
  - dp[i-1][j+1]: a new element has been added to array a.
  - The remaining elements in the permutation match array b (i.e., p[i:] matches array b).
- If p[i-1]>p[i], then we can split the problem into two subproblems:
  - dp[i-1][j+1]: a new element has been added to array b.
  - The remaining elements in the permutation match array a (i.e., p[i:] matches array a).

dp with Memoization: Combine tabulation and memoization for a hybrid approach that leverages both methods.

For each cell dp[i][j], calculate the value by considering all possible values of j-1 and i-1, and then update the cell accordingly.
