===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

The base case is when i=n and j=0, meaning we've reached the end of both arrays. In this case, return True if p is empty up to index i+j-1; otherwise, return False.
State: (i, j) = current positions in a and b; Transition relationship: dp[i][j] = True if p[0...i+j-1] can be merged from a[0:i] and b[0:j];
If p[i+j-1] is less than both a[i-1] and b[j-1], then the current element in p can be merged with either array; otherwise, it cannot.
Implement dynamic programming with bottom-up approach: fill up the DP table from the base case (i=n and j=0) to the top.

For edge cases:
- If n is 0 or p is empty, return True because an empty array can always be merged with another empty array.
- If a[i-1] > b[j-1], then try merging from the left; if not, try merging from the right.
