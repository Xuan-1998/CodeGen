===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.
The base case is when i=n, meaning we've reached the end of the permutation. In this case, check if the current permutation p matches either array a or b.
The state is the current permutation p up to index i, and the transition is adding the next element from either array a or b to p.
To avoid duplicate subproblems, use memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary. When the same subproblem is encountered again, its solution can be looked up instead of recomputed.

To further improve the plan:

* Define a more specific state and transition functions that take into account the problem constraints (e.g., the permutation p being broken down into smaller segments).
* Consider using a 2D array to store the dynamic programming results, where each cell [i][j] represents whether it is possible to construct the subarray p[:i+1] from arrays a[:j] and b[:k], for some k.
* Edge cases to consider: when n=0 (empty permutation), or when there are no more elements in either array a or b.
