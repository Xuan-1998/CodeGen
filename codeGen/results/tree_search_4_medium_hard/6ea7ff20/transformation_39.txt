===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about how you can use memoization to avoid solving the same subproblem multiple times and store the results in a table for later reference.

dp[i][j] = 1 if p[2*i-1] < p[2*j-1] and there exist a, b such that merge(a,b) = p[:2*i]+p[2*i:2*j], dp[i][j] = 0 otherwise

dp[i][j] = 1 if exists k such that p[2*i:2*(i+1)] and p[2*j:2*(j+1)] can be merged into a single array and all elements in the arrays are less than p[2*k], dp[i][j] = 0 otherwise

Utilize a priority queue to efficiently find the maximum or minimum value in a range and determine the feasibility of merging two arrays.
