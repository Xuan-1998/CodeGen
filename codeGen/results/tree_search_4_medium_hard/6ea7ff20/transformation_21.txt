===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

Let dp[i][j] be True if p[:i] is the merge of two arrays, each with j elements, and False otherwise. We use a dictionary memo to store intermediate results and look them up instead of recalculating.

Base case: When j=0, meaning we're considering an empty array. In this case, check if the remaining elements in the permutation match array b. If they do, then dp[i][0] = True; otherwise, dp[i][0] = False.

Recurrence: For i > 0 and j > 0, consider two cases:
1. p[i-1] < p[i-j]. In this case, dp[i][j] is the same as the result of merging p[:i-1] with an array of length j-1 and a single element p[i-1].
2. p[i-1] >= p[i-j]. In this case, dp[i][j] is the same as the result of merging an array of length i-1 with an array of length j.

Memoize: Store dp[i][j] in memo and check it before recalculating to avoid redundant computation.

Return: The final answer is dp[2n][n].
