===BEGIN PLAN===
Think about how you can use memoization to avoid solving the same subproblem multiple times and store the results in a table for later reference.

Let dp[i][j] be 1 if there exist arrays a, b such that p = merge(a,b) with no common elements.
dp[i][j] will be 0 otherwise.

For i=0: Initialize dp[0][0] to 1 because empty array can always be merged with itself.

For i from 1 to n:
    For j from 0 to n:
        If p[2i-1] < p[2j-1]:
            dp[i][j] = 1 if and only if there exist a, b such that merge(a,b) = p[:2*i]+p[2*i:2*j].
            dp[i][j] = 0 otherwise.
        If p[2i] < p[2j]:
            dp[i][j] = 1 if and only if there exist a, b such that merge(a,b) = p[:2*i]+p[2*i:2*j], dp[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

For i from n to 2n:
    For j from 0 to n:
        If p[2i-1] < p[2j-1]:
            dp[i][j] = 1 if and only if there exist a, b such that merge(a,b) = p[:2*i]+p[2*i:2*j], dp[i][j] = 0 otherwise.
        If p[2i] < p[2j]:
            dp[i][j] = 1 if and only if there exist a, b such that merge(a,b) = p[:2*i]+p[2*i:2*j], dp[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

If dp[n][n] is 1 then return "YES", else return "NO".
