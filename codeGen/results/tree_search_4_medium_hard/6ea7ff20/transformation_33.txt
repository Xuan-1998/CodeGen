===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

State: 
- i: the current index in p
- j: the current index in one of the arrays (either a or b)
- a: the set of elements in array a
- b: the set of elements in array b

Transition relationship:
dp[i][j] = True if and only if:

    - i == n and j == 0: base case, return True if p is empty
    - (a âˆ© b) == set() and can be merged from a and b
    - for every possible element x in p[i], dp[i-1][j] or dp[i-1][j+1]

Employ top-down approach, recursively solving subproblems and storing results in a dictionary.
