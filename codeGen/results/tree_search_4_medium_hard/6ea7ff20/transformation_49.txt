===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] = 1 if (i == j or dp[i-1][j-1]) and 
    p[i] != p[j] and not any element in p[:i] is equal to p[j] and 
    p[i] != p[j-1] and not any element in p[:j] is equal to p[i]
dp[i][j] = 0 otherwise

Consider defining dp[i][j] as the boolean indicating whether it's possible to rearrange the elements at indices i and j in p into two arrays a and b, such that all elements in a are distinct and all elements in b are also distinct.

State transitions:

* If p[i] == p[j], then dp[i][j] = 0
* If p[i] != p[j] and not any element in p[:i] is equal to p[j] and 
    p[i] != p[j-1] and not any element in p[:j] is equal to p[i], 
    then dp[i][j] = 1

Use dynamic programming to fill up a 2D table, where each cell represents whether it's possible to rearrange the elements at indices i and j into two arrays with no common elements.

Fill up the table in the following order:
* For i from 0 to n-1
* For j from i+1 to 2n-1
* dp[i][j] = (p[i] != p[j]) and 
    (not any element in p[:i] is equal to p[j] or not any element in p[i:j] is equal to p[0:i])
