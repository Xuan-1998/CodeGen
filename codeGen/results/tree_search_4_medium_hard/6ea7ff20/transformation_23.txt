===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.
The base case is when j=0, meaning we're considering an empty array. In this case, check if the remaining elements in the permutation match array b.

Define state s as the number of elements in array a, and transition relationship by trying all possible splits of the permutation at position i, updating s accordingly.

Apply memoization using a dictionary to cache and reuse subproblem results.

For each test case:
  Initialize a boolean flag isPossible = false
  Iterate through the permutation p from right to left (i.e., from end to start)
    For each i in range(2n-1, n-1, -1):
      If p[i] < p[i+1]:
        Split the permutation at position i into two arrays a and b
        Recursively call the function on a and b
        If the recursive call returns true:
          Set isPossible = true
          Break the loop

  Return "YES" if isPossible; otherwise, return "NO"
