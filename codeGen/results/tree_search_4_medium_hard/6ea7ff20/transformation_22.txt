===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

The base case is when j=0, meaning we're considering an empty array. In this case, check if the remaining elements in the permutation match array b.

Define state s as a pair (i, j), where i represents the current position in the permutation and j represents the number of elements in array a. The transition relationship is by trying all possible splits of the permutation at position i, updating s accordingly.

Use dynamic programming with memoization to store subproblem solutions in a 2D array dp.

For each cell dp[i][j], try all possible splits of the permutation at position i and update j accordingly. If j=0, check if the remaining elements match array b. If true, return "YES". Otherwise, recursively call dp for the remaining elements and update j.

The final answer is stored in the top-right corner of the dp array. Check this cell to determine if there exist arrays a and b that satisfy the conditions.
