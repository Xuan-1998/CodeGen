===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

Let dp[i][j] represent whether there exist arrays a and b, each of length i and with no elements in common, so that p=merge(a,b) up to the i-th element. Let c be a binary flag indicating whether there are any common elements between arrays a and b up to the i-th element.

Create a memoization dictionary where keys are tuples (i-1, j-1, c) representing the current state of arrays a and b, and values are boolean indicators indicating whether p=merge(a,b) is possible up to the i-th element. 

For each permutation pi in [0..n-1], consider two cases: 
- If pi is not in either array a or b, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j].
- If pi is in one of the arrays and not in the other, then dp[i][j] = True if the current element can be merged correctly with both arrays.

Update dp values based on these two cases. 

To improve the plan, consider sorting the permutation p beforehand to make the recursive calls more efficient. This way, you can avoid redundant comparisons by comparing elements in order of their appearance in the permutation.

The potential issue is that this plan assumes that the input permutation is valid (i.e., it has no repeated elements and its length is a multiple of 2). You should add checks to ensure that the input meets these conditions before starting the algorithm. 

This plan includes edge cases such as when i or j is less than 0, or when p[i] is not in either array. These cases can be handled by returning False or using base cases for dp[0][j] and dp[i][0].
