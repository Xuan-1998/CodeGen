===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

The base case is when j=0, meaning we're considering an empty array. In this case, check if the remaining elements in the permutation match array b.

Define dp[i][j] as a boolean indicating whether there exist arrays a and b such that p[:i]=merge(a,b) and |a|=j.

DP Tabulation: Define a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is True if permutation p[:i] can be merged into arrays a and b of length j, considering all possible splits of the remaining elements in p into two arrays a and b such that a has exactly j elements.

For each i from 1 to n:
    For each j from 0 to i:
        If j is 0, then dp[i][j] is True if p[:i] matches array b.
        Otherwise, consider all possible splits of the remaining elements in p[:i] into two arrays a and b such that |a|=j. 
        Check if either p[:j] or p[j:] can be merged with b to form p[:i], then dp[i][j] is True.

Return dp[n][n].
