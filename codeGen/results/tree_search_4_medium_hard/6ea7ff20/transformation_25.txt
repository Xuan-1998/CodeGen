===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

The base case is when i=n and j=0, meaning we've reached the end of both arrays. In this case, return true if p is empty.
State: (i, j) = current positions in a and b; Transition relationship: dp[i][j] = True if p[0...i+1] can be merged from a[0:i] and b[0:j];

Create a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents whether the permutation p[:i+j] can be obtained by merging arrays a[:i] and b[:j].
If p[i+j-1] is equal to the last element of either array, then it's guaranteed that there exist two arrays a and b that satisfy the condition. This means we can return True directly.

Transition relationship: dp[i][0] = (p[2*i] < p[2*i+1]) and a[:i] can be merged with b; 
dp[i][j] = True if p[2*i+j-1] is equal to the last element of either array, then return True.
Transition relationship: dp[i][0] or (p[2*i] > p[2*i+1]) and a[:i] can be merged with b; 
dp[i][j] = False if p[2*i+j-1] is not equal to the last element of either array, then return False.
