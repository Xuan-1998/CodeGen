===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

The base case is when i=n, meaning we've reached the end of the permutation. In this case, check if the current permutation p matches either array a or b.

State: A tuple (i, j) representing the indices in arrays a and b that we have processed so far.
Transition:
    If i < n, then consider adding ai to p and incrementing i.
    If j < n, then consider adding bj to p and incrementing j. We also need to handle the case when both i and j are less than n.

Utilize memoization by creating a dictionary memo where memo[(i, j)] = True if p matches arrays a and b up to indices i and j.
    Initialize the memo with base cases: memo[(n, 0)] = False, memo[(0, n)] = False
    For each (i, j) in range(n+1):
        If p[i] == ai or p[j] == bj:
            If i < n:
                If j < n:
                    memo[(i+1, j+1)] = True if (p[:i+1], p[:j+1]) can be merged else False
                Else: 
                    memo[(i+1, 0)] = True
            ElseIf j < n:
                memo[(i, j+1)] = True

Return "YES" if memo[(n, n-1)] is True; otherwise return "NO".
