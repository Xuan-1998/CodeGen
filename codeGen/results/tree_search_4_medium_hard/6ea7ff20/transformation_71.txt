===BEGIN PLAN===
DP[i][j] = { 1 if there exist arrays a and b such that merge(a,b) equals permutation up to index i, with array a having length j; else 0 };

Initialize a table dp of size (2n+1) x (n+1), where dp[i][j] represents whether there exist arrays a and b such that merge(a,b) equals permutation up to index i, with array a having length j.

Base case: dp[0][0] = 1, since we can always create empty arrays a and b such that merge(∅,∅)=∅ equals the permutation up to index 0, with both arrays having length 0.

For each i from 1 to 2n:
  For each j from 0 to n:
    If the current permutation element is less than or equal to any of the previous elements in the permutation, then we can split this into two cases:
      - Case 1: The last element in the array a is greater than the current permutation element. In this case, we have merge(a,b) = [b_1] + dp[i-1][j-1], since we can recursively solve for merge(a,[b_2,…,b_m]).
      - Case 2: The last element in the array b is less than or equal to the current permutation element. In this case, we have merge(a,b) = [a_1] + dp[i-1][j], since we can recursively solve for merge([a_2,…,a_n],b).
    Otherwise, if there are no previous elements in the permutation that is less than or equal to the current permutation element, then we have merge(a,b) = [a_1] + dp[i-1][0], since we can recursively solve for merge([a_2,…,a_n],∅).

Return dp[2n][n].
