dp[i][j] = 1 if p[2i]+p[2i+1] is less than or equal to p[2j]+p[2j+1], dp[i][j] = 0 otherwise

Create a dictionary memo where each key is a tuple representing the indices of the current problem and its value is whether or not it's possible to split the permutation into two arrays that satisfy the condition.
For i from 0 to n-1:
    For j from i to n-1:
        If p[2i]+p[2i+1] is less than or equal to p[2j]+p[2j+1]:
            dp[i][j] = 1
        Otherwise:
            dp[i][j] = 0
Check if it's possible to split the permutation into two arrays that satisfy the condition by looking at the bottom-right corner of the dp table.
If dp[0][n-1] is 1, then "YES" else "NO"
