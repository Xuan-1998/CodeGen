===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

The base case is when i=n, meaning we've reached the end of the permutation. In this case, check if the current permutation p matches either array a or b.

State: A tuple (a, b, p) representing the arrays and permutation we have processed so far.
Transition:
 1. If both a and b are empty, return "YES" since p is an empty permutation.
 2. If one of a or b is empty, add the non-empty array to p and continue recursively with the updated arrays.
 3. Otherwise, find the smaller element between the first elements of a and b. Add this element to p. Then, recursively solve the problem for the remaining elements in both arrays.

Apply top-down memoization by solving the problem recursively and storing intermediate results to avoid redundant computations.
