===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

State: (i, j) = current positions in a and b;
Transition relationship:
    - dp[i][j] = True if p[0...i+j-1] can be merged from a[0:i] and b[0:j];
    - dp[i][j] = False if either i or j is greater than n, meaning we've gone beyond the length of the arrays.

Base case:
    - When i=n and j=0, return True if p is empty. Otherwise, return False.
Memoization:
    - Store the solutions of subproblems as they are solved, and reuse them when needed.

Recursion:
    - dp[i][j] = True if a[i-1] < b[j-1]; 
        - then merge(a[0:i-1],b[0:j-1]) can be merged from a[0:i] and b[0:j].
    - dp[i][j] = False if a[i-1] >= b[j-1];
        - then we must add the element in array a to the beginning of the result, 
          which means p[0...i+j-1] cannot be merged from a[0:i] and b[0:j].

Edge cases:
    - When i=0 or j=0, return True if p is empty. Otherwise, return False.
    - When i=n or j=n, check the remaining elements in p to see if they can be merged.
