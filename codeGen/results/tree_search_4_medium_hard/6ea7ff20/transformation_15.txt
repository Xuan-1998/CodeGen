===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

The base case is when i=0, meaning we've reached the start of the permutation. In this case, check if the current permutation p matches either array a or b.

The state is the current permutation p up to index i, and the transition is removing the next element from either array a or b from p.

Implement dynamic programming using a recursive function with memorization, where each call to the function stores its result in a cache and looks up previously computed solutions before computing them.

For each subproblem, check if the current permutation p matches either array a or b. If it does, return "YES". If not, recursively solve the subproblem for i+1 until we reach the end of the permutation.
