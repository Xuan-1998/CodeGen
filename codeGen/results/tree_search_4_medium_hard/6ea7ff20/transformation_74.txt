state dp[i][j] = { 1 if there exist arrays a and b such that merge(a,b) equals permutation up to index i, with array a having length j; else 0 };
State: dp[i][j] = { 1 if the permutation from index 0 to i can be split into two non-empty arrays of lengths j and n-j, such that both arrays have no common elements; else 0 }.
To implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach using a 2D table where each cell dp[i][j] represents whether there exist arrays a and b such that merge(a,b) equals the permutation up to index i, with array a having length j.

state:
dp[0][j] = { 1 if p[0:j-1] can be split into two non-empty arrays of lengths j and n-j with no common elements; else 0 }
for i from 1 to 2n
    for j from 0 to min(i,n)
        dp[i][j] = {
            1 if there exist arrays a and b such that merge(a,b) equals permutation up to index i, with array a having length j;
            else 0
        }
state:
output "YES" if dp[2n][n] is 1; otherwise output "NO"
