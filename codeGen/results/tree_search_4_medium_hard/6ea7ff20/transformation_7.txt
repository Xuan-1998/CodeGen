===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

Base case: When i = n, meaning we've reached the end of the permutation. In this case, check if the current permutation p matches either array a or b.

State: A tuple (i, j) representing the indices in arrays a and b that we have processed so far.
Transition:
    If i < n, then consider adding ai to p and incrementing i.
    If j < n, then consider adding bj to p and incrementing j.
    We also need to handle the case when both i and j are less than n.

Memoize the state tuple (i, j) and use it to store the results of subproblems.

Additional step: Before memoizing, check if the current permutation p is already a valid merge of arrays a and b. If it is, return "YES". This avoids unnecessary recursive calls.
