===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

The base case is when i = n, meaning we've reached the end of the permutation. In this case, check if the current permutation p matches either array a or b.

State: A tuple (i, j) representing the indices in arrays a and b that we have processed so far.
Transition:
    - If i < n and aj <= pi:
        + If j < n and ap < aj:
            + Set dp[i][j] to FALSE
        + Else:
            + Set dp[i][j] to dp[i-1][j]
    - If i < n and aj > pi:
        + Set dp[i][j] to dp[i][j-1]
    - If j < n and bj > pj:
        + Set dp[i][j] to dp[i][j-1]
    - Else:
        + Set dp[i][j] to TRUE

Use dynamic programming by creating a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] stores whether the permutation p matches arrays a and b up to indices i and j.

Edge cases:
    - When i or j is equal to n, check if the remaining elements in p match either array a or b.
    - If both i and j are equal to n, return YES if p matches either array a or b.
