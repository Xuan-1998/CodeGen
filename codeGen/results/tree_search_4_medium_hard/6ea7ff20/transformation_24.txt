===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming to solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems that can be solved recursively.

The base case is when j=0, meaning we're considering an empty array. In this case, check if the remaining elements in the permutation match array b.

Define state s as the number of elements in array a, and transition relationship by trying all possible splits of the permutation at position i, updating s accordingly.

To improve efficiency, consider using both tabulation and memoization to store intermediate results and avoid redundant computation.

Edge cases:
- When n is 1, check if p contains two unique elements. If yes, return "YES". Otherwise, return "NO".
- When n is greater than 1, initialize a dynamic programming table dp of size (2n+1) * (n+1). Fill the table recursively by considering all possible splits of the permutation at position i and updating the state accordingly.

The final answer can be obtained by checking if there exists an s in the last row of the table such that the number of elements in array a is equal to n.
