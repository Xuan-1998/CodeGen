===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming solution where you build up a table of valid polygon configurations from left to right, using the current knight's mood as input for each configuration.

The state expression is the minimum number of sides required in the polygon to accommodate the consecutive good moods seen so far. Initialize it with 3 (minimum possible).

View the state as the number of good knights that would be needed to make up for the previous bad knight, considering the current knight's mood. The transition relationship is that when a good knight is encountered, subtract 1 from the state; if a bad knight is encountered, add 1 to the state.

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a table of size n+1 and filling it up from left to right, considering each knight's mood as the current input. If at any point the required minimum number of sides exceeds the maximum possible (n), return "NO". Otherwise, update the result accordingly.
