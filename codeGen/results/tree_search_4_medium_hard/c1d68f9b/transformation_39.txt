===BEGIN PLAN===
The approach could be dynamic programming with memoization, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a memoized dictionary.

The state could be defined as the last good knight's index, and the base case would be when there is only one knight left (the first knight).

Define the transition relationship as: if the current knight is in good mood and the previous knight was also in good mood, then the next possible state would be the same. If the current knight is not in good mood, then there's no way to form a regular polygon.

Define a recursive function that takes the current state (last good knight's index) and the total number of knights who are in good mood, and use memoization to store the results of subproblems.

The final answer would be YES if and only if there exists a last good knight whose index is 0, meaning it's the first knight. Otherwise, it would be NO.
