The approach could be bottom-up with dynamic programming, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a table.

The state could be defined as a tuple (i, s) where i is the index of the current knight and s is the set of indices of knights who are in good mood. The base case would be when the size of the set is equal to n - 1, meaning one knight left.

Define the state as a boolean value indicating whether a regular polygon can be formed with the first i-1 knights, given that the current knight's index is i and the set of indices of knights in good mood is s. The transition relationship can be defined as: if the i-th knight is in good mood (i.e., 1 is in s) and the state for the previous i-1 knights allows a regular polygon to be formed, given that the current knight's index is i-1 and the set of indices of knights in good mood is s \ {i}, then the next possible state would be True. If not, then the next possible state would be False.

Create a dynamic programming table dp of size (n+1) x 2^n, where each cell dp[i][s] represents whether a regular polygon can be formed with the first i-1 knights, given that the set of indices of knights in good mood is s. Initialize all cells to True, except for dp[0][set()] which should be False.

Fill up the table by iterating over the knights from left to right and updating each cell based on the transition relationship defined above. Finally, check whether dp[n][set(range(n))] is True; if it is, then a regular polygon can be formed with all knights in good mood sitting at its vertices.
