The approach could be top-down with memoization, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a memoized dictionary.
The state could be defined as a tuple (k, i), representing the number of good moods k and the index i of the knight being processed.

State: A 2D table dp[n][n] where n is the total number of knights. dp[i][j] represents whether we can form a regular polygon with i knights in good mood up to j-th vertex.
Transition: For each i from 1 to n-1 and j from 0 to n-1, if the current knight's mood at j is different from that of the previous one at (i-1), then we add 1 to the count of good moods; otherwise, we keep it unchanged. If the number of good moods k equals i, then dp[i][j] is true.
The base case could be when there are only two knights, in which case the polygon can always be formed if both knights have a different mood than the previous one.

Bottom-up dynamic programming approach:
1. Initialize a 2D table dp[n][n] with all values being False.
2. Iterate over each i from 1 to n-1 and j from 0 to n-1.
3. For each pair (i, j), check if the current knight's mood at j is different from that of the previous one at (i-1).
4. If it is, then add 1 to the count of good moods k; otherwise, keep it unchanged.
5. If the number of good moods k equals i, then dp[i][j] is True.
6. The answer would be whether dp[n-1][n-1] is True.
