===BEGIN PLAN===
The approach could be top-down with memoization, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a memoized dictionary.

The state could be defined as a tuple (k, even_count), where k is the number of knights that have been placed at vertices in good mood so far, and even_count represents whether the total count of 'good moods' is even or not. This way we can handle both the cases when the current knight's mood is the same as the previous one and when it's different.

Transition: 
- If the current knight's mood is the same as the previous one, then the next possible polygon can be formed only if even_count is 1 (i.e., the total count of 'good moods' is even), otherwise it cannot.
- Otherwise, we need to check whether k is divisible by 3 or not. If it is, then we can form a new polygon with k+1 knights, and update even_count accordingly. If it's not, then we cannot form a new polygon.

Implement memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary with (k, previous_mood) as keys. 

The base case would be when k = 0, where we can form a polygon with all knights in good mood if and only if there is an even number of 'good moods' initially.
