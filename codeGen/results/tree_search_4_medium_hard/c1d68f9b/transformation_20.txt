The approach could be top-down with memoization, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a memoized dictionary.

State could be defined as a tuple (i, b), where i is the current knight's index and b is the boolean indicating if the polygon can be formed up to this point. This state captures whether the polygon can be formed with the given mood of knights up to the ith position.

To tabulate the solutions for each knight's index, consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with a 1D array.

Let dp[i] denote whether the polygon can be formed with the given mood of knights up to the ith position. Then dp[i] could be calculated as follows:

- If i is the first knight, then dp[i] = (mood[i] == 1) because the polygon must start with a good-mooded knight.
- For i > 0, consider two cases:
    * Case 1: The current knight's mood is different from the previous one. In this case, we can form a polygon if and only if the polygon can be formed without including the current knight (dp[i - 1] == true). So dp[i] = dp[i - 1].
    * Case 2: The current knight's mood is the same as the previous one. Then we can form a polygon if and only if the current knight is in good mood (mood[i] == 1) and the previous kights' moods were alternating (dp[i - 1] == true). So dp[i] = (mood[i] == 1) && dp[i - 1].

The final answer would be dp[n - 1], where n is the total number of knights.

To avoid edge cases, consider initializing the array with false values for i < 3 and setting dp[0] = (mood[0] == 1). This way, you ensure that the initial conditions are considered correctly.
