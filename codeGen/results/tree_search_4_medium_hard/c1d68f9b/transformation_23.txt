===BEGIN PLAN===
The approach could be top-down with memoization, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a memoized dictionary.

The state could be defined as (n, b), where n is the current knight's index and b is a boolean indicating if the polygon can be formed up to this point. The base case would be when i == 0, in which case b would always be True because there are no knights yet. For other cases, we would recursively check if the mood of the current knight matches its position modulo the total number of knights (i.e., whether it's a "good" mood). If it is, then we can form a regular polygon up to this point and update b accordingly. Otherwise, we cannot form a regular polygon at this point.

The transition relationships would involve updating b based on the current knight's mood and position.

Define the state as (n, b) where n represents the current knight's index and b is a boolean indicating if the polygon can be formed up to this point.
If n == 0:
    return True
else:
    for i in range(n):
        if moods[i] % n != 0: 
            continue
        else:
            b = b or (mood == 1)
    return b
