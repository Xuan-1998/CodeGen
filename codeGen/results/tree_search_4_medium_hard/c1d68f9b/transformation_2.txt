===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming solution where you build up a table of valid polygon configurations from left to right, using the current knight's mood as input for each configuration.

The state expression is a tuple (k_count, mood_sum), where k_count is the count of good moods and mood_sum is the sum of all knights' moods seen so far.

State: (k_count, mood_sum)
Transition:
  - If k_count >= n/2 and mood_sum == k_count, then YES; 
    else if k_count < n/2 or mood_sum != k_count, then NO

Tabulate the solution by iterating over all possible combinations of knight moods and updating the table accordingly.

For the edge cases:
  - Check for an empty polygon (n = 0) and return "NO" in that case.
  - Check for a single knight (n = 1) and return "NO" in that case as well, since you can't form a regular polygon with just one knight.
