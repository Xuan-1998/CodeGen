===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming solution where you build up a table of valid polygon configurations from left to right, using the current knight's mood as input for each configuration.

The state expression is the maximum number of consecutive good moods seen so far, initialized with 0. This represents the number of good knights that would be needed to make up for the previous bad knight, considering the current knight's mood.

View the transition relationship as follows: when a good knight is encountered, check if the current state plus one (representing the new good knight) is divisible by n (the number of knights). If it is, update the state with the result; otherwise, keep the current state. If a bad knight is encountered, update the state to 0.

Apply memoization using a recursive function that stores intermediate results in a dictionary to avoid redundant computations.

The base case for the recursion is when the state becomes 0 or n. In this case, return "YES" if the last good knight encountered had its mood represented by 1 (indicating a valid configuration), and "NO" otherwise.
