The approach could be top-down with memoization, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a memoized dictionary.

The state could be defined as a tuple (k, s), where k is the number of knights with good moods and s is the sum of their positions around the table. This state captures whether the polygon can be formed up to this point and if all the knights with good moods are sitting at consecutive vertices.

Consider states as a tuple (i, b), where i is the current knight's index and b is the boolean indicating if the polygon can be formed up to this point. When evaluating a state, we check if the current knight has a good mood and if all the knights with good moods are sitting at consecutive vertices.

Implement memoization with a dictionary to store solutions for subproblems (k, s), where k is the number of knights with good moods and s is the sum of their positions around the table. This allows us to avoid redundant computations by reusing the stored solutions for overlapping subproblems.

When evaluating a state, if all the knights have good moods and they are sitting at consecutive vertices, we return "YES". Otherwise, we return "NO".

The base case would be when there is only one knight with a good mood or less, in which case we can form a polygon. This is because the polygon is trivially formed by a single vertex.

To solve the problem, we start from the state (n-1, 0) and recursively evaluate states until we find the base case or determine that it's impossible to form a polygon.
