===BEGIN PLAN===
You can also think of a bottom-up tabulation solution where you build up the table row by row, considering the current polygon configuration and the next knight's mood.

The state could be a boolean indicating whether the current polygon is regular, with the base case being when there is only one knight (YES) or no knights (NO).

State: A boolean indicating whether a regular polygon can be formed with the given knights in good mood, considering the current configuration;
Transition:
    - If the next knight's mood is 1 (good), then it depends on the previous state; 
    - If the next knight's mood is 0 (bad), then the state becomes 'NO' regardless of the previous state.

You can implement a dynamic programming solution by defining a table dp where dp[i] represents whether a regular polygon can be formed with the given knights in good mood, considering the first i knights.

State Transition:
    - dp[1] = YES (base case: one knight);
    - dp[2] = NO (bad mood for both);
    - For i >= 3:
        - If all previous moods were good, then consider a polygon with i sides and check if the current knight's mood is good;
        - If any of the previous moods were bad, then return NO.

The state transition depends only on the previous state and the current knight's mood. This ensures that the solution is correct for all possible inputs.

This plan includes edge cases: when there is one knight (base case), or no knights (impossible to form a polygon).
