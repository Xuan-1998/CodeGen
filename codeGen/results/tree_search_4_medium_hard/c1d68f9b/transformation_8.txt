===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming solution where you build up a table of valid polygon configurations from left to right, using the current knight's mood as input for each configuration.

The state expression is a tuple (mood_sum, k_count), where mood_sum is the sum of all knights' moods seen so far and k_count is the count of good moods.

State: (k_count+1 if m==1 else k_count-1, mood_sum+(m==1)*2), Transition: If state[0]%n >= n//3, then YES; else NO.
Implement dynamic programming by iteratively updating a 1D array based on previous computations, similar to the Fibonacci sequence.
