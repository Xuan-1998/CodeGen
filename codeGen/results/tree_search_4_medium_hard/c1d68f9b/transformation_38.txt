The approach could be top-down with memoization, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a memoized dictionary.

The state could be defined as a set s of indices of knights who are in good mood, and the base case would be when the size of the set is equal to n - 1, meaning one knight left. 

Define the state as the total number of knights who are in good mood, and the transition relationship can be defined as: 
if the current knight is in good mood and the previous knight was also in good mood, then the next possible state would be the total number of knights who are in good mood plus 1. If the current knight is not in good mood, then there's no way to form a regular polygon.

Use a dynamic programming table with O(n) space complexity and implement the transition function recursively with memoization. 

For edge cases, we should consider that if n is less than 3, we cannot form any regular polygon so return 'NO'. If all knights are in good mood, then it's possible to form a regular polygon of size n.

Here's the updated plan:
