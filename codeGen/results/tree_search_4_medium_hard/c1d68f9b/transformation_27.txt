===BEGIN PLAN===
The approach could be top-down with memoization, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a memoized dictionary.

The state could be defined as a tuple (k, prev_mood), where k is the number of knights that have been placed at vertices in good mood so far, and prev_mood is 1 if the previous knight was not in a good mood, or 0 if the previous knight was. This allows us to consider the current knight's mood relative to its predecessor.

State: (k, prev_mood) where k is the number of knights already placed, and prev_mood is 1 if the previous knight was not in a good mood, or 0 if the previous knight was.
dp = [[False for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(n+1)]

For each state (k, prev_mood), we can check if it's possible to place the remaining knights such that their moods alternate with respect to the previous one.

We start by initializing dp[0][0] and dp[0][1] as True, since placing no knights is always possible.
For k from 1 to n:
    For prev_mood in range(2):
        If the current knight's mood matches prev_mood, then we can't place it; otherwise, we can. Set dp[k][prev_mood] accordingly.

Finally, return "YES" if dp[n][0] or dp[n][1], and "NO" otherwise.
