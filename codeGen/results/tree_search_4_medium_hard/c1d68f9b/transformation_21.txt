===BEGIN PLAN===
The approach could be bottom-up with dynamic programming, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a table.

Let dp[i] represent whether a regular polygon can be formed with knights in good mood sitting at its vertices up to the ith knight. Then we have:

dp[0] = False
For i from 1 to n-1:
    dp[i] = (knight's mood is good) AND (polygon can be formed up to the previous knight)
    For j from 1 to i:
        dp[j] = (previous polygon was valid) AND (current knight's mood is good)

The base case is that a regular polygon can be formed with no knights or one knight.

We also need to handle the edge cases where n is less than or equal to 2. In this case, we cannot form a polygon with at least three sides.

Finally, the answer is whether the polygon can be formed up to the last knight, i.e., dp[n-1].
