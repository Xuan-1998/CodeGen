===BEGIN PLAN===
The approach could be bottom-up with dynamic programming, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a 2D table.

The state could be defined as a tuple (k, prev_mood), where k is the number of knights that have been placed at vertices in good mood so far, and prev_mood is the previous knight's mood. This allows us to take into account the current knight's mood in relation to the previous one.

Transition: If the current knight's mood is different from the previous one, then we can form a polygon if the total count of 'good moods' is even, otherwise we cannot. If the current knight's mood is the same as the previous one, then we can only form a polygon if the total count of 'good moods' is odd.

Use dynamic programming to fill up a 2D table where the dimensions represent the number of knights placed and their moods respectively. The base case would be when k = 0 or k = 1, in which case we return YES or NO accordingly based on the total count of 'good moods'.

Edge cases: Ensure that we handle the edge cases correctly, such as when n is less than 3.
