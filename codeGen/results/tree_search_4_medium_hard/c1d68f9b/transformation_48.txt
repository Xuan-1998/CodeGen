===BEGIN PLAN===
You can also think of a bottom-up tabulation solution where you build up the table row by row, considering the current polygon configuration and the next knight's mood.

State: The number of good-mooded knights seen so far, and whether they can form a regular polygon with that many vertices.
Transition:
  If the next knight's mood is 1 (good), increment the count and check if it forms a regular polygon with the new count;
  If the next knight's mood is 0 (bad), reset the count to 0.

Consider the knight's mood as the state variable and update it based on the previous configuration;

State transitions:
  - If there are no knights, the polygon cannot be formed.
  - If there is one good-mooded knight, the polygon can be formed.
  - For two or more good-mooded knights, consider the cases where they are all at the same angle (YES) and not (NO).
State transitions:
  - If there are no bad moods, the polygon cannot be formed.
  - If there is one bad mood, reset the count to 0.

Check for edge cases:
  - When there are no knights, return "NO".
  - When there is only one knight, return "YES".
