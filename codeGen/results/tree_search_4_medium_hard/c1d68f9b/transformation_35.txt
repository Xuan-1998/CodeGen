The approach could be top-down with memoization, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a memoized dictionary.

The state could be defined as a set s of indices of knights who are in good mood, and the base case would be when the size of the set is equal to n - 1, meaning one knight left. However, this definition seems unclear and may not accurately capture the problem's requirements. A more precise definition of the state could be necessary.

Define the state as a tuple (i, j) representing the indices of two knights who are in good mood, where i is the index of the current knight and j is the index of the previous knight. This definition seems reasonable for determining whether a regular polygon can be formed with knights in a good mood sitting at its vertices.

The transition relationship can be defined as: if both knights at positions i and j are in good mood, then the next possible state would be a tuple (i+1, j) or (j, i+1). If only one of them is in good mood, then there's no way to form a regular polygon. This definition seems correct for determining whether a regular polygon can be formed with knights in a good mood sitting at its vertices.

Use dynamic programming with bottom-up approach and tabulation: this is the most promising approach for solving this problem efficiently. It seems that memoization could also be useful here, especially if there are many repeated subproblems.

The plan looks correct overall, but it may not cover all edge cases, such as when n = 3 or when the input contains only zeros (i.e., no knights in good mood). These edge cases should be considered and included in the final solution. Additionally, a more detailed explanation of how to determine whether a regular polygon can be formed based on the given state might be helpful.
