===BEGIN PLAN===
You can also think of a bottom-up tabulation solution where you build up the table row by row, considering the current polygon configuration and the next knight's mood.

State: A tuple (k, b) representing whether k good-mooded knights can form a regular polygon with that many vertices, and whether it is indeed a regular polygon; 
Transition: If the next knight's mood is 1 (good), update (k + 1, true) if k + 1 is not greater than n and there exists an integer p such that p divides (n - 1) and k % p == 0;
If the next knight's mood is 0 (bad), update (0, false);

Start with a 2D table where each cell [i, j] represents whether a regular polygon can be formed with i good-mooded knights and j vertices;
