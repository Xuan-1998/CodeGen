===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming solution where you build up a table of valid polygon configurations from left to right, using the current knight's mood as input for each configuration.

The state expression is a tuple (mood_sum, k_count), where mood_sum is the sum of all knights' moods seen so far and k_count is the count of good moods.

State: (n-k_count, sum(mood[i] for i in range(n))%2)
Transition: If state[0] > 0 and state[1] == 0, then YES; else NO.

Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a table with a size of n+1, where the i-th entry represents whether it's possible to form a polygon with i good knights. Then, for each knight, update the table accordingly based on its mood.

Initialize dp with [False] * (n + 1) and set dp[0] to True.
For each knight in range(n):
    If mood[knight] is 1:
        dp[i+1] = or(dp[i], i%2 == 0)
    else:
        dp[i+1] = dp[i]
return "YES" if dp[n] else "NO"
