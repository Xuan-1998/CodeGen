===BEGIN PLAN===
The approach could be top-down with memoization, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a memoized dictionary.

Define the state as a tuple (s, k) where s is the set of indices of knights who are in good mood, and k is the index of the current knight. The base case would be when the size of the set is equal to n - 1, meaning one knight left.

The transition relationship can be defined as: if the i-th knight is in good mood (mood[i] == 1) and the state for the previous i-1 knights allows a regular polygon to be formed (memo[s.union({i})] == True), then the next possible state would be True. If not, then the next possible state would be False.

Use a memoized dictionary memo to store the solutions of subproblems as you solve them, and check if the solution for a given state has been computed before.

The final result can be obtained by checking the value of memo[(set(), n-1)].
