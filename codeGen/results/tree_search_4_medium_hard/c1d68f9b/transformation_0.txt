===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming solution where you build up a table of valid polygon configurations from left to right, using the current knight's mood as input for each configuration.

The state expression is a tuple (mood_sum, k_count), where mood_sum is the sum of all knights' moods seen so far and k_count is the count of good moods.

State: ((k_1, mood_sum_1), (k_2, mood_sum_2)), Transition:
    If k_1 == n/2 and all moods are 1, then YES; else NO.
Use a 3D array to store the dynamic programming table, where dp[i][j][k] represents whether it's possible to form a polygon with i knights, j good moods, and k bad moods.
Initial conditions: dp[0][j][k] = "NO" for all j, k
Final condition: dp[n][j][k] = "YES" if and only if there exists a valid configuration of the previous n-1 knights that can be extended to form a regular polygon with good moods.
Iterate through each knight from 0 to n-1:
    For each knight, calculate the new state (mood_sum, k_count) based on the current mood.
    Transition to the next state using the calculated (k_2, mood_sum_2).
    Update dp[i][j][k] with the result of the transition.

The final answer is the value of dp[n-1][n/2][0].
