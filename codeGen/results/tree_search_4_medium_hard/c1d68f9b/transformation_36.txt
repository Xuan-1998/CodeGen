===BEGIN PLAN===
The approach could be top-down with memoization, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a memoized dictionary.

Let's define the state as a tuple (i, j) representing the indices of two knights who are in good mood, where i is the index of the current knight and j is the index of the previous knight. The base case would be when the size of the set is equal to n - 1, meaning one knight left.

The transition relationship can be defined as:
if both knights at positions i and j are in good mood, then the next possible state would be a tuple (i+1, j) or (j, i+1). If only one of them is in good mood, then there's no way to form a regular polygon.

Dynamically construct a memoized dictionary to store solutions for subproblems. For each subproblem, check if it can be solved by either:
- considering the current knight and the previous one as being in good mood
- skipping the current knight and considering only the previous ones

Store the result of each subproblem in the memoized dictionary. When solving a subproblem, check if its solution is already stored in the dictionary to avoid redundant computation.

Let's use the following variables:
memo: a dictionary to store solutions for subproblems
dp[i]: True if it's possible to form a regular polygon considering only knights at indices up to i

The final answer would be dp[n - 1]
