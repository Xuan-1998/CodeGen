===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming solution where you build up a table of valid polygon configurations from left to right, using the current knight's mood as input for each configuration.

The state expression is the maximum number of consecutive good moods seen so far, initialized with 0.
Think of the state as a flag indicating whether the polygon configuration is still valid at the given position. The transition relationship is that when a good knight's mood (1) is encountered, you can either continue the current polygon or start a new one; if a bad knight's mood (0) is encountered, the current polygon becomes invalid.

Using a 2D table to store the dynamic programming states:

    - The outer dimension represents the current position.
    - The inner dimension represents the maximum number of consecutive good moods seen so far.
- Initialize with 'NO' for all states except those where the maximum number of consecutive good moods is 0, which is initialized with 'YES'.

Transition function:
    - If the current mood is good (1), you can either continue the current polygon or start a new one. So, update the state to be the maximum between the current state and 1.
    - If the current mood is bad (0), the current polygon becomes invalid, so set the state to 'NO'.

Answer the problem by checking if there exists at least one valid configuration in the table where the maximum number of consecutive good moods seen so far is equal to n / k (since a regular polygon with k sides needs at least k consecutive good moods).
