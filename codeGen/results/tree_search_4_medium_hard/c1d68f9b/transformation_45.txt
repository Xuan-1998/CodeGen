You can also think of a bottom-up tabulation solution where you build up the table row by row, considering the current polygon configuration and the next knight's mood.

State: A boolean indicating whether a regular polygon can be formed with the given knights in good mood, considering the current configuration;
Transition: If the next knight's mood is 1 (good), then it depends on the previous state; if the next knight's mood is 0 (bad), then the state becomes 'NO' regardless of the previous state.

Let memo[i][j] represent whether a regular polygon can be formed with the given knights in good mood, considering the first i knights and the next j knights are in good mood. The base cases would be when there is only one knight (YES) or no knights (NO). 

The recurrence relation would be:

- If there's only 1 knight, it's YES.
- If there are no knights, it's NO.
- For i > 0 and j > 0: 
    - If the last knight's mood is good (j == 1), then a regular polygon can be formed if and only if the previous configuration was also a regular polygon. So, memo[i][1] = memo[i-1][1].
    - If the last knight's mood is bad (j == 0), then it doesn't matter what the previous configuration was; a regular polygon cannot be formed in this case. So, memo[i][0] = NO for all i.

This way, you build up the table row by row and avoid recomputing subproblems using memoization.
