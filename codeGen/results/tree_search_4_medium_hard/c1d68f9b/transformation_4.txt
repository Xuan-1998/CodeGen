===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming solution where you build up a table of valid polygon configurations from left to right, using the current knight's mood as input for each configuration.

The state expression is a tuple (mood_sum, k_count), where mood_sum is the sum of all knights' moods seen so far and k_count is the count of good moods.

State: (n-k_count, sum(mood[i] for i in range(n))%2)
Transition:
    If state[0] > 0 and state[1] == 0, then YES;
    else NO

Use memoization by defining a function that takes the current state and returns a boolean indicating whether it's possible to form a polygon with the given number of good knights. Then, use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and avoid recomputation.

For the base case, consider when there is only one knight or two knights. If there is only one knight, it's always possible to form a polygon (with that knight as the center). For two knights, if they are both in good moods, then it's also possible to form a polygon with them sitting at its vertices.

Then, for the recursive case, iterate through all possible configurations and check if the current state is valid. If it is, update the memoization table accordingly.

Finally, return the result of the memoized function on the initial state (0, 0).
