===BEGIN PLAN===
The approach could be dynamic programming with memoization, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a memoized dictionary.

The state could be defined as a tuple (k, prev_mood), where k is the number of knights that have been placed at vertices in good mood so far. This would allow us to consider different moods of the previous knight when placing the current one.

state = [(i, 0) for i in range(n+1)]
memo = [[-1]*2 for _ in range(n+1)]

For each state (k, prev_mood), we can check if it's possible to place a regular polygon with k knights already placed and prev_mood as the mood of the previous knight. This would involve checking if there are enough good moods remaining to form a polygon.

If it is possible, return "YES", otherwise return "NO".
