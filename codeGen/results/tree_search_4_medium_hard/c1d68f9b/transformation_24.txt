===BEGIN PLAN===
The approach could be dynamic programming with memoization, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a memoized dictionary.

The state could be defined as a tuple (i, b), where i is the current knight's index and b is the boolean indicating if the polygon can be formed up to this point. The goal is to find all permutations that satisfy the condition for each configuration.

Let the state be represented by a tuple (n, p), where n is the number of knights with good moods and p is a permutation representing the order of their positions around the table. Transition relationships could be defined as generating all possible permutations for each configuration.

Use dynamic programming to create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is True if and only if it's possible to form a regular polygon with i knights having good moods, the first j-1 knights being in good mood order.

The base case would be when there are less than or equal to three knights (n <= 3), as these can always be arranged in a regular polygon. The transition relationship would involve generating all possible permutations for each configuration and updating dp[i][j] accordingly.

To improve the plan, consider implementing a pruning strategy to reduce the number of permutations that need to be generated. This could be done by considering only those permutations where the current knight is in good mood if and only if the previous k-1 knights are also in good mood.

The potential issue with this plan is that it may not terminate for larger values of n, as generating all possible permutations can result in an exponential number of possibilities. Edge cases should be considered when there are less than or equal to three knights (n <= 3), as these can always be arranged in a regular polygon.
