===BEGIN PLAN===
The approach could be dynamic programming with memoization, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a memoized dictionary.

The state could be defined as a set s of indices of knights who are in good mood. The base case would be when the size of the set is equal to n - 1, meaning one knight left.

Define the state as a boolean value indicating whether a regular polygon can be formed with the first i-1 knights, and the transition relationship can be defined as: if the i-th knight is in good mood and the state for the previous i-1 knights allows a regular polygon to be formed, then the next possible state would be True. If not, then the next possible state would be False.

Initialize an empty dictionary memo = {} and iterate over all possible states. For each state, compute its solution using the transition relationship and store it in the memo dictionary.

For edge cases, we should handle the case when n is less than 3, as there's no way to form a polygon with fewer than three knights.

Here's the updated plan:
