===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming solution where you build up a table of valid polygon configurations from left to right, using the current knight's mood as input for each configuration.

The state expression is the number of consecutive good moods, initialized with 0.
View the state as the minimum number of good knights needed to make up for the previous bad knight, considering the current knight's mood.

Define a function dp(k) that returns true if it is possible to form a regular polygon with k good knights in total and false otherwise. This will serve as the transition relationship.

Transition relationship:
- If the current knight's mood is 1 (good), update the state by subtracting 1 from the current value of k, ensuring that dp(k) returns true if and only if k >= 0.
- If the current knight's mood is 0 (bad), set k to -1 and ensure that dp(-1) returns false.

The base case for the recursion is when k = 0 or negative. In this case, it is impossible to form a regular polygon with less than or equal to zero good knights.

Define another function isValid(knights) that checks if a given configuration of knights' moods can be used to form a regular polygon. This will serve as the main function.

Transition from the plan to code:
- Initialize an array dp of size n + 1, where dp[i] represents whether it is possible to form a regular polygon with i good knights.
- Fill the dp table using the transition relationship and base case.
- Return "YES" if dp[n] returns true, indicating that a regular polygon can be formed; otherwise return "NO".
