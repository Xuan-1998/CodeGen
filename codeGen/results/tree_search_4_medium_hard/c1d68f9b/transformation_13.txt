===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming solution where you build up a table of valid polygon configurations from left to right, using the current knight's mood as input for each configuration.

The state expression is the number of consecutive good moods. Initialize with 0.

Think of the state as a flag indicating whether the polygon configuration is still valid at the given position. The transition relationship is that when a good knight's mood (1) is encountered, the flag remains valid; if a bad knight's mood (0) is encountered, the flag becomes invalid. Initialize with 'valid' and update accordingly.

The base case for the dynamic programming should be when there are less than 3 knights (since we need at least 3 to form a polygon), in which case it's always invalid to form a polygon.

Memoization can be applied using a recursive function with a memoization dictionary.

A potential issue is that the plan doesn't handle the case where all moods are bad, but there are more than 2 knights. In this case, we should return 'NO', since no polygon can be formed.

The edge cases should be handled by considering the initial state of the dynamic programming table, which should be initialized to 'invalid' (since we start with less than 3 knights), and then update accordingly as we iterate through the knight's moods.
