===BEGIN PLAN===
You can also think of a bottom-up tabulation solution where you build up the table row by row, considering the current polygon configuration and the next knight's mood.

State: A boolean indicating whether a regular polygon can be formed with the given knights in good mood, considering the current configuration;
Transition: If the next knight's mood is 1 (good), then it depends on the previous state; if the next knight's mood is 0 (bad), then the state becomes 'NO' regardless of the previous state.

You can use dynamic programming to build up a table row by row, where each cell dp[i] represents whether a regular polygon can be formed with the given knights in good mood, considering the first i knights. The transition from one state to another would depend on the current knight's mood and the previous configuration.
If the current polygon is not regular, then it doesn't matter what the next knight's mood is; you will always get 'NO'. So, you just need to update the state correctly when a new good knight appears.

Here are some key steps:

- Initialize dp[0] to 'YES' because with no knights, there can be no polygon. Then for each i from 1 to n:
  - If the current mood is 1 (good), then check if the previous configuration was regular; if it wasn't, then you get 'NO'; otherwise, update the state as before.
  - If the current mood is 0 (bad), then just set the state to 'NO' regardless of the previous configuration.

Finally, return dp[n].
