===BEGIN PLAN===
The approach could be dynamic programming with memoization, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a memoized dictionary.

The state could be defined as a tuple (k, s) where k is the number of knights who are in good mood and s is the sum of moods of all knights. The base case would be when the size of the set is equal to n - 1, meaning one knight left.

Define the state as the total number of knights who are in good mood, and the transition relationship can be defined as: if the current knight is in good mood and the previous knight was also in good mood, then the next possible state would be the total number of knights who are in good mood plus 1. If the current knight is not in good mood, then there's no way to form a regular polygon.

Implement memoized recursion using a dictionary where the keys are tuples representing the current state and the value is either 'YES' or 'NO' indicating whether a regular polygon can be formed.

The base case would be when k equals n - 1, in which case we return 'YES'. If there's no valid transition from the current state to any of the next states, then we return 'NO'.

Initialize the memoized dictionary with base cases for all possible values of k.

For each valid state (k, s), calculate the next possible states by iterating over the moods of the knights and checking if the current knight is in good mood. If it is, add the transition to the memoized dictionary. If not, return 'NO' because no regular polygon can be formed.

Finally, check if a valid state (n - 1, s) exists in the memoized dictionary. If it does, return 'YES', otherwise return 'NO'.
