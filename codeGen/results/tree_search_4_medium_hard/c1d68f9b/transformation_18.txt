The approach could be dynamic programming with memoization, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a memoized dictionary.

The state could be defined as a tuple (i, b), where i is the current knight's index and b is a boolean indicating if the polygon can be formed up to this point. The base case would be when there are less than 3 knights left, in which case we can simply check the mood of the remaining knights.

Consider states as a tuple (k, s), where k is the number of knights with good moods and s is the sum of their positions around the table.

Use dynamic programming with a 2D table to store states (i, b) and iterate from top to bottom, where i is the current knight's index and b is the boolean indicating if the polygon can be formed up to this point. For each state, check if the current knight has a good mood, and if so, recursively call the function with the updated state.

When updating the state, increment k by 1 if the current knight has a good mood, and update s by adding the position of the current knight to it.

The final answer would be the value in the bottom-right cell of the table, which represents whether a regular polygon can be formed with knights in a good mood sitting at its vertices.
