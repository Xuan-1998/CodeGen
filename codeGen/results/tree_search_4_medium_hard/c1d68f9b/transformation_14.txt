===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a dynamic programming solution where you build up a table of valid polygon configurations from left to right, using the current knight's mood as input for each configuration.

The state expression is the number of consecutive good moods, initialized with 0. Think of the state as a flag indicating whether the polygon configuration is still valid at the given position.

The transition relationship is that when a good knight's mood (1) is encountered, the flag remains valid; if a bad knight's mood (0) is encountered, the flag becomes invalid. Initialize with 'valid' and update accordingly.

Employing a 2D array for tabulation to keep track of the number of valid configurations ending at each position:

* Create a 2D array dp[n][k] where n is the number of knights and k is the number of consecutive good moods.
* Initialize all values in dp as 0, except dp[0][0] which is set to 1 (since one configuration always exists: an empty polygon).
* Iterate through each knight from left to right:
	+ For each knight's mood, update the state and transition accordingly:
		- If the mood is good (1), increment the number of valid configurations by the previous value in dp.
		- If the mood is bad (0), reset the state back to 0.
	+ Update dp[i][k] as the maximum possible configuration ending at position i with k consecutive good moods.
* Check if there exists a configuration with k = n, meaning all knights are in a good mood. If yes, return "YES", otherwise "NO".
