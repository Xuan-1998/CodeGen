The approach could be top-down with memoization, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a memoized dictionary.

Define the state as (i, b), where i is the current knight's index and b is a boolean indicating if the polygon can be formed up to this point. The initial state would be (0, False).

The transition relationship could be defined as follows:

- If it's the first knight (i == 0), then the polygon can be formed only if the current knight is in a good mood (mood[i] == 1) and b is True.
- For other knights, the polygon can be formed if the current knight is in a good mood (mood[i] == 1) and the previous knight was also in a good mood (memo[i - 1][True]).

The base case would be when i >= n, indicating that all knights have been considered. In this case, the polygon can be formed if b is True.
