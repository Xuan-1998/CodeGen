The approach could be top-down with memoization, breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a memoized dictionary.

State: A tuple (k, p) where k is the number of knights that have been placed at vertices in good mood so far, and p is the parity (0 or 1) of the count of 'good moods'.

Transition:
- If the current knight's mood is the same as the previous one, then the next possible polygon can be formed only if the total count of 'good moods' is even, otherwise it cannot.
- Otherwise, the transition depends on whether k is divisible by 3 or not.

Memoize using a dictionary with tuple keys and boolean values, where each key represents a knight's placement state and each value stores whether a polygon can be formed with that state.
