===BEGIN PLAN===
The approach is correct, using top-down dynamic programming with memoization can solve this problem efficiently.

The state (i, b) is well-defined and represents the current knight's index i and whether the polygon can be formed up to this point, indicated by boolean value b.

To improve the plan, we should consider the base case for the dynamic programming: when there are less than 3 knights left, a regular polygon cannot be formed (return "NO").

To handle edge cases, we need to ensure that our state and transition relationships cover all possible scenarios. This can be achieved by checking if there is at least one knight with good mood remaining after considering each configuration.

Here's the updated plan:
