===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize recursive function calls by storing intermediate results in a dictionary.
State: The number of ways to choose k-bit integers for the first i elements, such that bitwise AND is greater than or equal to bitwise XOR; Base Case: 1 when i = 0
Use a state variable that represents the maximum value achievable in the bitwise AND operation for the first i elements and use this value to determine the next possible states.
State variables:
    dp[i][max_and]: The number of ways to choose k-bit integers for the first i elements, such that bitwise AND is greater than or equal to max_and
    max_and: The maximum value achievable in the bitwise AND operation for the first i elements

Dynamic programming with nested loops to tabulate intermediate results:
    For each possible state (i, max_and):
        If max_and == 0:
            dp[i][max_and] = 1
        Else:
            dp[i][max_and] = sum(dp[j][and_result] for j in range(i) for and_result in range(max_and))
        For each possible next_state (j, new_max_and):
            if j < i and new_max_and <= max_and:
                dp[i][max_and] += dp[j][new_max_and]
    Base Case: dp[0][0] = 1
