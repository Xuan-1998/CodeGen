===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] = 1 if all elements in the range [0, i) have a bitwise AND with j and the number of ones in j is even, else dp[i][j] = 0;

Create a 2D array dp[1 << k][k + 1] where dp[i][j] represents the number of arrays such that the bitwise AND of all elements in [0, i) is at least bitwise XOR of all elements in [0, i) and has j ones.

For each query, calculate the bitwise AND and XOR of all elements in [0, i) and find the corresponding values in dp[i][j] for different values of j. If the bitwise XOR is 0, then only one array satisfies the condition (all elements are 0). So return 1. Else, sum up the values from dp[i][j] where the number of ones in j is even.

For each query, create a prefix sum array and for each element calculate the bitwise AND and XOR with the previous elements. For each pair of bitwise AND and XOR, find the corresponding value in dp[i][j].

Finally, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
