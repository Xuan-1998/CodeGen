===BEGIN PLAN===
Combine bitwise operations with dynamic programming to efficiently count arrays.

Let dp[i][j] = 1 if all elements in the range [0, i) have a bitwise AND with j, else dp[i][j] = 0;
dp[i][j] represents whether the first i numbers have a bitwise AND with j, considering only bits up to position k.
Use a table-based approach where dp[i][j] is updated based on previous values and current element.

Let's consider each bit from rightmost (least significant) to leftmost (most significant).
For each bit position k:
    For each possible value of bitwise AND result j in [0, 2^k - 1]:
        Initialize count = 0
        Iterate through all elements in the range [0, i):
            If element has a bitwise AND with j and bitwise OR with j:
                Increment count
        Set dp[i][j] to count % (10^9 + 7)
    For each possible value of bitwise XOR result j in [0, 2^k - 1]:
        Initialize count = 0
        Iterate through all elements in the range [0, i):
            If element has a bitwise XOR with j:
                Increment count
        Set dp[i][j] to count % (10^9 + 7)

When counting arrays satisfying the condition, consider each bit position k:
    For each possible value of bitwise AND result j in [0, 2^k - 1]:
        If dp[n][j] is greater than or equal to dp[n][j ^ (2^k - 1)]:
            Increment total count
    Return total count % (10^9 + 7)
