===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] = 1 if there exists an array with bitwise AND equal to i and bitwise XOR equal to j;
dp[i][j] is calculated by iterating over all possible values of k, then count arrays where bitwise AND is at least i and bitwise XOR is at most j;
Use memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
Base case: If all numbers less than or equal to 2^k have a bitwise AND of at least i, then dp[i][j] = 0; else, iterate over all possible arrays with bitwise AND equal to i and bitwise XOR equal to j;
Combine the results of subproblems to calculate the final result.
