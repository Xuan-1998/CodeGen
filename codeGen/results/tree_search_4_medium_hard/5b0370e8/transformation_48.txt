===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up a table, where each entry represents the result of a subproblem.
A tuple (i, s) representing the number of ways to form an array with i elements where all bitwise AND operations are greater than or equal to k-j, given that the last bit was set as s.
Define a tuple (j) representing the number of ways to form an array with i elements where all bitwise XOR operations are greater than or equal to j.
Create a dp table where each entry represents the result of a subproblem using the formula dp[i][s] = sum(dp[i-1][t] for t in range(2^k)) * (1 if s == 0 else 0) and dp[j] = dp[j-1] + sum(dp[i-1][s] for i in range(j+1) for s in range(2^k)).
Calculate the final answer as sum(dp[n][s] for s in range(2^k)) modulo 10^9+7.
