===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency.

The state can be defined as a pair (i, y) where i is the index of the array element being considered and y is the bitwise AND result of all previous elements. The base case would be when i reaches n.

The transition relationship would be that if the current element x has a certain property (e.g., it's even), then the next AND result would be the same, otherwise it would decrease by 1. This allows us to memoize the results based on the last two elements.

Define another state (i, z) where i is the index of the array element being considered and z is the bitwise XOR result of all previous elements. The transition relationship for this state would be that if the current element x has a certain property (e.g., it's even), then the next XOR result would be the same, otherwise it would increase by 1 or stay the same.

To reduce the number of possible states, use bit manipulation to simplify the memoization process. For example, instead of considering all possible values for y and z, consider only the bits that are relevant to the problem (e.g., the most significant bit).

Use dynamic programming to solve the problem by filling a 2D table dp[i][y] where i is the index of the array element being considered and y is the bitwise AND result of all previous elements. The value of dp[i][y] would be the number of arrays that satisfy the condition up to the ith element with bitwise AND result y.

The final answer would be the sum of dp[n-1][y] for all possible values of y.
