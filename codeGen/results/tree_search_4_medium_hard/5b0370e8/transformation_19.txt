===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize recursive function calls by storing intermediate results in a dictionary.

State:
    dp[i]: the number of arrays with bitwise AND less than bitwise XOR up to index i,
    possible_to_increase[i]: whether it's possible to change the ith element to increase bitwise AND without decreasing bitwise XOR;
Base Case: False when i < 0

State: store the count of arrays satisfying the condition up to index i;
Transition:
    iterate from 0 to k-1 (since all elements are less than 2^k)
        for each possible value x in [0, 2^k):
            update dp[i] and possible_to_increase[i] based on whether bitwise AND increases when ith element is set to x
    return dp[n]
Create a dynamic programming table dp of size n+1 where each entry stores the count of arrays satisfying the condition up to that index, then iterate from i = 0 to n-1 and update this state by considering each possible value of the ith element.
