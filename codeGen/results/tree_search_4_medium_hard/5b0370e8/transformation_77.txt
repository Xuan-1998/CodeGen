===BEGIN PLAN===
Combine bitwise operations with dynamic programming to efficiently count arrays.

dp[i][j] = 1 if all elements in the range [0, i) have a bitwise AND with j, else dp[i][j] = 0;

dp[i][j][l] counts the number of arrays such that the lth bit is 1 and bitwise AND of all elements is at least bitwise XOR of all elements.

Consider using a 3D DP table to store intermediate results.

// Correct approach, but needs more detail on how to fill the DP table.
// Also, need to handle edge cases where k = 0 or n = 0.

Initialize dp[0][0] = 1, as there is only one way to generate an array with 0 elements.

For each i from 1 to n:
    For each j from 0 to 2^k - 1:
        For each l from 0 to k:
            If the lth bit of j is 1 and bitwise AND of all elements in range [0, i) has at least bitwise XOR of all elements in that range:
                dp[i][j][l] = (dp[i-1][j^(2^l-1)][l-1] + dp[i-1][j^(2^l-1)][l]) % 10^9+7
            else:
                dp[i][j][l] = 0

Finally, the answer is the sum of all values in dp[n][2^k-1].
