===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize recursive function calls by storing intermediate results in a dictionary.
State: The number of ways to choose k-bit integers for the first i elements, such that bitwise AND is greater than or equal to bitwise XOR; Base Case: 1 when i = 0
Memoize each possible bitwise AND result as a state variable, where the state transition is determined by whether the current bit of the number can be set to 1 without changing the bitwise AND result.
Use memoization to store intermediate results of recursive function calls and avoid redundant computation.
Determine the optimal solution for the base case (i = 0) and recursively calculate the solutions for larger values of i, considering the state transitions.
To further optimize the plan, consider using a dynamic programming table instead of a dictionary to store memoized values. This can be more memory-efficient if the problem has overlapping subproblems.
Edge cases should include handling when k = 0 or i = n (the maximum number of elements), as these may have different solutions compared to the general case.
The updated plan is:
