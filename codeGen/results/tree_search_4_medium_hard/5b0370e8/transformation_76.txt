===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] = 1 if all elements in the range [0, i) have a bitwise AND with j and a bitwise XOR with (2^k - 1), else dp[i][j] = 0;
Initialize dp arrays for 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < k
For each pair (i, j):
    Count the number of elements in range [0, i) that have a bitwise AND with j
    If count is equal to i:
        Set dp[i][j] = 1 if all elements in range [0, i) have a bitwise XOR with (2^k - 1), else dp[i][j] = 0;
    Else:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
Return the count of arrays that satisfy the condition: sum(dp[n][0], ..., dp[n][k])
Modulo it by 10^9+7
