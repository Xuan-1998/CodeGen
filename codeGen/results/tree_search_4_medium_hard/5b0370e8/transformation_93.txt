===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] = sum(dp[m][j-1] * (all elements in the range [i-m, i) have a bitwise AND with j-1) for m from 0 to i
Apply memoization by creating a dictionary dp where dp[i][j] is updated based on previously computed values.
Calculate the number of arrays that satisfy the condition using dp[i][k].
dp[0][0] = 2^(k-1)
Initialize dp with all elements as 2^(k-1).
For each i from 1 to n:
    For each j from 0 to k:
        Calculate dp[i][j] based on previously computed values.
Calculate the total count using dp[n][k].
Print the total count modulo 10^9+7.
