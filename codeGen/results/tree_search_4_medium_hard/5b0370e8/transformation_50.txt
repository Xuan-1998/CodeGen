===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up a table, where each entry represents the result of a subproblem.

A tuple (i, s) representing the number of ways to form an array with i elements where all bitwise AND operations are greater than or equal to k-j, given that the last bit was set as s.

Define a tuple (i, j) representing the number of ways to form an array with i elements where all bitwise XOR operations are greater than or equal to j, given that the last k-j bits were set as 0.

Implement dynamic programming by creating a dp table with dimensions i*(2^k) and initialize all entries as 0. Then fill up the table using the following formulas:

- For j from 0 to k-1: dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][t] for t in range(2^k)) * (1 if j == k-1 else 0).
- For i from n-1 down to 1, calculate dp[i][k-1] as the total count of arrays with i elements that satisfy the condition.

Calculate the final result as sum(dp[n-1][j] for j in range(2^k)) % (10^9+7).
