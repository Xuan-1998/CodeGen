===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up a table, where each entry represents the result of a subproblem.

A tuple (i, s) representing the number of ways to form an array with i elements where all bitwise AND operations are greater than or equal to k-j, given that the last bit was set as s.

A state s represents the last k bits of an array and the corresponding transition is based on whether the next element should be a 0 or 1 in the least significant bit position.

Use a bottom-up approach, initializing the table with base cases (i.e., i = 0), then iteratively update each entry based on previously computed values. The recurrence relation can be derived as follows:

- If s is the same as the last k bits of an array that has already been processed and the bitwise AND operation for that array is greater than or equal to k-j, add the number of ways to form such arrays to the current count.
- If s is not the same as the last k bits of any array that has already been processed, update the table with a base case (i.e., i = 0) and proceed with the next iteration.

The plan seems correct. To improve it, consider using memoization or storing previously computed values in an array to reduce computation time.

One potential issue with this plan is handling edge cases such as arrays with all zeros or ones, which should be treated separately.

Edge cases:
- Array with all zeros: The bitwise AND operation for such an array will always be 0. Therefore, initialize the table accordingly.
- Array with all ones: The bitwise AND operation for such an array will always be k-j. Therefore, initialize the table accordingly.
