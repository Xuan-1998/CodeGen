===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency.
Let's define two arrays dp_xor and dp_and where dp_xor[i] is the count of bitwise XOR results greater than or equal to i, and dp_and[i] is the count of bitwise AND results greater than or equal to i.

State can be defined as a tuple (i, x) where i is the index of the array element being considered and x is the bitwise XOR result of all previous elements.
The state can also be defined as a pair (i, y) where i is the index of the array element being considered and y is the bitwise AND result of all previous elements.

Base case would be when i reaches n.
Transition relationship would be that if the current element x has a certain property (e.g., it's even), then the next XOR result would be the same, otherwise it would increase by 1. This allows us to memoize the results based on the last two elements.

Use a state transition function that takes into account both bitwise XOR and AND operations.
For each element in the array, calculate its bitwise XOR with all previous elements and update dp_xor accordingly. Do the same for bitwise AND operation and update dp_and accordingly.

Finally, sum up dp_xor[i] and dp_and[i] to get the total count of arrays that satisfy the condition, modulo 10^9+7.
