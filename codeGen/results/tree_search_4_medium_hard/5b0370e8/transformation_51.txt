===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency. 
The state expression could be a triple (i, mask, xored), where i is the current bit position we're considering, mask is the current bitwise AND result of all previous elements, and xored is the current bitwise XOR result of all previous elements. The base case would be when i exceeds k or there are no more bits to consider.
Use a 3D DP table with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << k) x 2, where state[i][mask][x] represents the count of arrays ending at position i with bitwise AND result mask and bitwise XOR result x. 
Initialize all states in the first dimension to 0. 
For each position i from n-1 down to 0:
    For each possible bitwise AND result mask from (1 << k - 1) down to 0:
        If there are no more bits to consider, update state[i][mask] accordingly.
        For each possible bitwise XOR result x from 0 to 1:
            Update state[i][mask][x] by considering all possible values for the current element and recursively calling the function for the updated mask and xored.
