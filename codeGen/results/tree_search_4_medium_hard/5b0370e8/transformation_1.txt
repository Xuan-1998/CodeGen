Memoize recursive function calls by storing intermediate results in a dictionary.
State: the number of arrays with bitwise AND greater than or equal to bitwise XOR up to index i, with k-1 bits; Base Case: 0 when i < 0
For each possible value less than 2^k, calculate the total number of arrays that satisfy the condition considering all numbers up to this point.
Update a dynamic programming table dp with dimensions n*k, where each cell dp[i][j] stores the result of the recursive function call for the current state.
Iterate over the input array and update the dynamic programming table based on the bitwise operations (AND and XOR) between the current number and previously considered numbers.
To improve the plan:
- Consider the properties of bitwise operations: AND is 0 if there's a mismatch in any bit position, while XOR will be 0 only when all bits match. This can help to reduce the complexity of the problem by simplifying the base cases and recursive function calls.
- Instead of using a dictionary for memoization, consider using a 2D array dp with dimensions n*k to store intermediate results. This can reduce memory usage and make the code more efficient.
- Add edge cases: what happens when i = 0 or j = 0? The base case should be updated accordingly.
