===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up a table, where each entry represents the result of a subproblem.
The state is a boolean indicating whether the current bit of the bitwise AND operation is set and the base case is when all bits are unset.

DP on bit value: for each bit position, we can have 0 or 1 as the value; if the AND result has this bit set, then all elements must have this bit set; if the XOR result has this bit set, then at least one element must have this bit set. We need to consider these two possibilities.

We can iterate through each bit position and for each bit, there are three cases:
1. Both AND and XOR results don't have this bit set.
2. The AND result has this bit set but the XOR result doesn't.
3. The XOR result has this bit set but the AND result doesn't.

For case 1, we can directly add up the counts from previous iterations (since all elements will be 0 at this bit position).
For cases 2 and 3, we need to consider how many elements can have this bit set.
We can use a dictionary to memoize these intermediate results for faster computation.
The final answer is the sum of counts from each bit position.
