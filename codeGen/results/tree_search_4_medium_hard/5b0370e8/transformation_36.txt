===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up a table, where each entry represents the result of a subproblem.
The state is a boolean indicating whether the current bit of the bitwise AND operation is set and the base case is when all bits are unset.
DP on bit value: for each bit position, we can have 0 or 1 as the value; if the AND result has this bit set, then all elements must have this bit set; if the XOR result has this bit set, then at least one element must have this bit set. We need to consider these two possibilities.
DP solutions can be implemented by using a 2D table where each entry represents the count of arrays satisfying certain conditions, with state variables for the current AND and XOR results.

For each bit position:
1. Initialize DP table with zeros
2. Iterate through all possible values (0 or 1) for this bit position
3. If the AND result has this bit set (i.e., AND_result & (1 << i)):
    a. All elements must have this bit set, so XOR_result must not have this bit set
    b. Count arrays that satisfy these conditions and update DP table
4. If the XOR result has this bit set:
    a. At least one element must have this bit set, so AND_result must not have this bit set
    b. Count arrays that satisfy these conditions and update DP table

Base case: when all bits are unset (AND_result == 0)
1. Initialize count to 0
2. Iterate through all possible values for the last bit position
3. If XOR_result is also 0, then all elements must be 0, so increment count
4. Update DP table with this count

Return the value in the DP table that corresponds to the final result of the bitwise AND and XOR operations.
