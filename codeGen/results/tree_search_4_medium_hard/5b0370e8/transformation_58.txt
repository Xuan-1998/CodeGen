===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency. The state expression could be a pair (i, mask), where i is the current bit position we're considering and mask is the current bitwise AND result of all previous elements. The base case would be when i exceeds k or there are no more bits to consider.

To further optimize this plan, you can separate the problem into two sub-problems:

1. Calculate the number of arrays with a given bitwise AND result for all elements.
2. Count the number of arrays that satisfy the condition for each possible bitwise AND result.

This separation allows us to use dynamic programming to solve these sub-problems recursively and store their results in a dictionary for memoization. 

To count the number of arrays that satisfy the condition, you can iterate through the possible values of the bitwise XOR operation and calculate the corresponding number of arrays with bitwise AND greater than or equal to the bitwise XOR.

This plan should correctly solve the problem and avoid potential issues by considering all edge cases.
