Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency.

The state expression could be a tuple (i, mask), where i is the current bit position we're considering and mask is the current bitwise AND result of all previous elements. The base case would be when i exceeds k or there are no more bits to consider.

You can use a 3-tuple state (i, x, y) where i is the current bit position, and x and y are the bitwise XOR and AND results respectively. This would allow you to handle the possibility of different numbers having the same bitwise AND result but different bitwise XOR results.

Applying dynamic programming principles by using a 2D table with dimensions (k+1, 1 << k) to store the count of arrays that satisfy the condition at each state. The rows represent the current bit position and the columns represent the current bitwise AND result.

The recursive relation would be: for each possible state (i, mask), calculate the total number of arrays ending with this state by summing over all possible values v at position i, such that the bitwise AND result of all previous elements is less than or equal to mask and the bitwise XOR result of all previous elements is less than or equal to v.

Finally, return the count modulo 10^9+7.
