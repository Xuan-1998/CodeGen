===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency.

Let dp[i][j] be the count of arrays for which the bitwise AND operation on all elements is at least j, given that the maximum element in the array is less than 2^i. The state expression could be simply the current bitwise AND result, and the base case would be when this result exceeds 2^i - 1.

Initialize dp[i][j] as follows:

- If i == 0 or j >= 2^i - 1, set dp[i][j] to 1 (the base case).
- For k from 0 to i:
    - If the kth bit of j is 0, then all arrays that satisfy the condition must have their kth bit as 0.
        - Initialize a counter for this case and add it to dp[i][j].
    - If the kth bit of j is 1, then there are two possibilities: either the array contains only zeros up to the kth bit (which doesn't affect the bitwise AND result), or it contains at least one 1 in that position.
        - Add the count from these two cases and add it to dp[i][j].

Then, for each test case:
- Read n and k as inputs.
- For each number x less than 2^k, read its value and calculate the bitwise XOR of all numbers seen so far, updating a variable xor_result.
- Calculate the bitwise AND of all numbers seen so far, updating another variable and_result.
- Print dp[k][and_result] as the answer.
