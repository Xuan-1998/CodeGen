===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency.
The state can be defined as (i, y) where i is the index of the array element being considered and y is the bitwise AND result of all previous elements. The transition relationship would be that if the current element x has a certain property (e.g., it's even), then the next AND result would increase by 1, otherwise it would stay the same.
Another approach could be to define the state as (i, and_result) where i is the index of the array element being considered and and_result is the bitwise AND result of all previous elements. The base case would be when i reaches n.
The transition relationship can be defined based on whether the current element x has a certain property or not. If it does, then the next AND result increases by 1; otherwise, it stays the same.

Initialize a DP array dp of size (2^k + 1) * (n + 1) with all values set to -1.
For each i from 0 to n:
    For each x from 0 to 2^k - 1:
        If this is the first element or the bitwise AND result of previous elements equals x, then update dp[i][x] based on whether the current element has a certain property or not.

Finally, calculate and return the sum of all values in dp where the bitwise XOR result exceeds the bitwise AND result.
