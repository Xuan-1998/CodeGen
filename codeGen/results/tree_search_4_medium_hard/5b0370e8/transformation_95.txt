===BEGIN PLAN===
Combine bitwise operations with dynamic programming to efficiently count arrays.

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[m][j-1] * (all elements in the range [i-m, i) have a bitwise AND with j-1) for m from 0 to i
    // Since dp[m][j-1] only depends on previous calculations, we can iterate over all possible values of j and calculate the sum for each j
dp[i][j] = (sum(dp[m][k-1] * (bitwise AND of all elements in the range [m, i) is j-1)) for m from 0 to i
    // Since bitwise AND operation has a property that it's monotonic, we can use dynamic programming to calculate and store intermediate results

Using a 2D array with indices i and j to store intermediate results and avoiding redundant calculations.

For each query:
    dp[query][result] += 1
    if result < query: // skip calculation for smaller results
        continue
    sum = 0
    for m from query - (2^k - 1) to 0 step -(2^k - 1):
        sum += dp[m][result - 1]
    return sum % (10^9 + 7)
