===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency. The state expression could be simply the current bitwise AND result, and the base case would be when this result exceeds 2^k - 1.

Consider a binary representation of the state as a bitstring where each bit represents whether the next bit in the AND operation is 0 or not. For example, if k = 3, then the states are represented by 3-bit strings (000 to 111).

Use dynamic programming to store and reuse intermediate results. Initialize dp[2^k - 1] as the base case where the result exceeds 2^k - 1.

For each possible state s from 0 to 2^k - 1, calculate the number of arrays that satisfy the condition given the bitwise AND result is s.
This could be done by iterating over all possible next bits (0 or 1) and updating the dp value accordingly.
The final answer would be dp[0].

Edge cases: Consider what happens when k = 0. In this case, there are no arrays that satisfy the condition since all bitwise AND results are 0.

This plan has potential issues with overflows when calculating the number of arrays for each state s, but these could be mitigated by using a large enough data type (e.g., long long in C++).
