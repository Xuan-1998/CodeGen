===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency.
Let dp[i] be the number of arrays that satisfy the condition up to i-th element.
The state expression could be simply the current bitwise AND result, and the base case would be when this result exceeds 2^k - 1. 
Use the bitwise AND result to determine which bits in the XOR operation are guaranteed to be 1, and then count the number of possible combinations for those bits.

To improve memoization efficiency, consider using a dictionary to store subproblem results instead of LRU cache.
This could reduce memory usage especially when dealing with large test cases.

The plan looks correct so far. It's a good start. However, it would be beneficial to add more details on how to count the number of possible combinations for those bits.
It would also be helpful to clarify whether we need to consider edge cases such as k being 0 or n being 1.

Overall, the plan has a good direction and can be improved upon with some refinement.
