===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency. The state expression could be simply the current bitwise AND result, and the base case would be when this result exceeds 2^k - 1.

Let's consider a binary representation of the state as a bitstring where each bit represents whether the next bit in the AND operation is 0 or not. We can use this to reduce the number of states from O(2^n) to O(k), which will greatly improve memoization efficiency.

Employ a two-pointer technique, where one pointer tracks the AND result and another pointer tracks the XOR result. For each new element in the array, we update both pointers accordingly: if the new bit is 0, we can set the AND result to be 0 (as it will remain unchanged) and set the XOR result to be either the old XOR result or the new element depending on whether the current bit of the XOR result is different from the current bit of the AND result.

This plan has considered all possible edge cases: when the bitwise AND operation exceeds 2^k - 1, when there are no elements in the array, and when all bits are 0.
