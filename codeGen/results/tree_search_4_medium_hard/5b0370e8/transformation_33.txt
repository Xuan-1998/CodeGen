===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up a table, where each entry represents the result of a subproblem.

State: A 2D boolean array (n x 2^(k-1)) dp[n][m] where:
    - n is the number of elements in the array.
    - m is the mask for bitwise AND operation.

Base case: All bits are unset. In this case, the result of the bitwise XOR operation is also 0.

DP on bit position:
    For each bit, if it's 0 in the AND result, then it can only be 0 in all elements.
    If it's 1 in the AND result, then it must be 1 in at least one element. This means we need to consider two possibilities - whether this bit is set in any element and whether it's not.

Iterative approach with a boolean array for the state:
    Initialize dp[0][mask] = true for all masks where mask is unset.
    For each additional element, iterate over all previous elements' masks:
        Calculate the new mask by performing bitwise AND with the current element.
        For each possible outcome of this bit (both 0 and 1), update the dp array accordingly.

State transition:
    If the current element's value is less than or equal to the mask, then it can only be 0 in all elements. In this case, we need to consider whether any previous bits are set.
    If the current element's value is greater than the mask, then it must be 1 in at least one element. In this case, we need to consider whether some previous bits are set.

Edge cases:
    Handle arrays with only one element and with no elements.
    For each array, calculate the result of bitwise AND and XOR operations on all elements.
    Count the number of arrays for which the result of the bitwise AND operation is greater than or equal to the result of the bitwise XOR operation on all elements.
