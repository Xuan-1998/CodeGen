===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency.

Let's define the state as a tuple (i, y) where i is the index of the array element being considered and y is the bitwise XOR result of all previous elements. The base case would be when i reaches n.

The transition relationship would be that if the current element x has a certain property (e.g., it's even), then the next XOR result would increase by 1, otherwise it would stay the same. This allows us to memoize the results based on the last two elements.

Define an additional state variable z as the bitwise AND result of all previous elements. Then, for each element x, calculate the new z as z & x (bitwise AND).

Use dynamic programming with a tuple state (i, y, z) where i is the index of the array element being considered, y is the bitwise XOR result of all previous elements, and z is the bitwise AND result of all previous elements.

Memoize the results based on the last three elements (i, y, z).

In the dynamic programming table dp[i][y][z], store the count of arrays that satisfy the condition when i elements have been processed, with XOR result y and AND result z.

The final answer would be the sum of all values in dp[n-1]. This value represents the total number of arrays that satisfy the condition for all possible n elements.
