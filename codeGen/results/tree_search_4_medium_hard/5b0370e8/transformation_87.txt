===BEGIN PLAN===
Combine bitwise operations with dynamic programming to efficiently count arrays.

dp[i] = 1 if all numbers less than or equal to 2^k have a bitwise AND of at least i, else dp[i] = 0;

dp[i][j] represents the number of arrays that have bitwise AND equal to i and bitwise XOR equal to j;

Memoizing the function dp[i][j] by storing previously computed results in a hash table. This allows us to avoid redundant calculations and speed up our solution.

For each test case, iterate through all possible values of bitwise AND from 0 to 2^k - 1. For each value i, calculate the number of arrays that have bitwise AND equal to i using dynamic programming. Finally, add up the counts for all values of i where bitwise XOR is less than or equal to bitwise AND.

This approach allows us to efficiently count the arrays that satisfy the condition, modulo 10^9+7.
