===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize recursive function calls by storing intermediate results in a dictionary.
State:
    dp[i][j]: the number of arrays with bitwise AND equal to j up to index i,
    last_bit: whether it's possible to change the ith element to increase bitwise AND without decreasing bitwise XOR;
Base Case:
    False when i < 0
Transition:
    update this state by considering each possible value of the ith element and counting the arrays that have this result.
    For each p in range(2^k), calculate the new bitwise AND and XOR results if the ith element is set to p,
    and recursively call dp(i+1, new_bitwise_and) or dp(i+1, new_bitwise_xor) depending on whether it's possible to increase bitwise AND without decreasing bitwise XOR;
