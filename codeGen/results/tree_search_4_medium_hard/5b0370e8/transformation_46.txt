===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up a table, where each entry represents the result of a subproblem.

A tuple (i, s) representing the number of ways to form an array with i elements where all bitwise AND operations are greater than or equal to k-j, given that the last bit was set as s.

The state s represents the last k bits of an array. The corresponding transition is based on whether the next element should be a 0 or 1 in the least significant bit position.

Let dp[i][s] be the number of ways to form an array with i elements where all bitwise AND operations are greater than or equal to k-j, given that the last bit was set as s. The base case is when i == 0, in which case there's only one way: the empty array.

For the recursive case, we have two possibilities for the next element:

* If the last bit of the array is not yet fixed (i.e., it can be either 0 or 1), we consider both cases and sum them up.
* If the last bit of the array is already fixed to be s, then there's only one possibility for the next element.

The transition function would look like this:

dp[i][s] = dp[i-1][s] + dp[i-1][~s]

where ~s represents the bitwise NOT operation on s.

Dynamically generate and store subproblems as needed, using a dictionary or hashmap for fast lookups.
