===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize recursive function calls by storing intermediate results in a dictionary.

State:
    - The number of arrays with bitwise AND less than bitwise XOR up to index i
    - Whether it's possible to change the ith element to increase bitwise AND without decreasing bitwise XOR
Base Case: 
    - False when i < 0

State:
    - Keep track of the maximum bitwise AND result seen so far
    - The number of arrays with this result
Transition:
    - Update this state by considering each possible value of the ith element
    - Count the arrays that have this result

Use a recursive function to solve this problem, and memoize the function calls by storing the results in a dictionary.

For each test case, print a single integer representing the number of arrays that satisfy the condition, modulo 10^9+7. The output is printed to standard output.
