===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency.
The state expression could be a triple (i, mask, xor), where i is the current bit position we're considering, mask is the current bitwise AND result of all previous elements, and xor is the current bitwise XOR result. This would allow you to take advantage of the property that for any given bit position i, the bitwise AND result of all elements at or below this position only depends on the values at those positions.
The base case would be when i exceeds k or there are no more bits to consider.

Formulate the transition function as follows:
- If the current bit is 0 and the previous bit was also 0, then mask remains the same but xor increases by 1.
- If the current bit is 0 and the previous bit was 1, then mask increases by 2^i and xor decreases by 1.
- If the current bit is 1 and the previous bit was 0 or 1, then mask increases by 2^i and xor remains the same.

Use dynamic programming to build up a table dp[i][mask] that stores the number of arrays ending with bitwise AND result mask at position i. Then iterate over all possible bitwise XOR results less than the minimum bitwise XOR result such that the bitwise AND result is greater than or equal to it, and add up the values in the table.
