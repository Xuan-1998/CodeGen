===BEGIN PLAN===
Combine bitwise operations with dynamic programming to efficiently count arrays.

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[m][j-1] * (all elements in the range [i-m, i) have a bitwise AND with j-1) for m from 0 to i
    - This approach is correct and efficient, as it avoids recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.
dp[i][j] = sum(dp[m][j-1] * (bitwise XOR of all elements in the range [i-m, i)) for m from 0 to i
    - This step correctly calculates the bitwise XOR of all elements in the given range.

Use a dynamic programming table with two dimensions and update each cell based on the previous cells
