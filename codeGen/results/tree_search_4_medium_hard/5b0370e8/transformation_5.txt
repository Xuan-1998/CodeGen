===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize recursive function calls by storing intermediate results in a dictionary.
State: The number of arrays with bitwise AND greater than or equal to bitwise XOR up to index i, with k-1 bits; Base Case: 0 when i < 0
Consider pairs of integers with bitwise AND greater than or equal to bitwise XOR and count their combinations.

Memoization table (dictionary) initialized with base case values.
For each possible last bit value (0 or 1), calculate the number of arrays that end with this value, given the state at index i-1.
Update memoization table accordingly.
