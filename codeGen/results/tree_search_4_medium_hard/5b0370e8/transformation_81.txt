===BEGIN PLAN===
Combine bitwise operations with dynamic programming to efficiently count arrays.
dp[i][j] = 1 if all elements in the range [0, i) have a bitwise AND with j, else dp[i][j] = 0;
dp[i][j] represents whether the first i numbers have a bitwise AND with j, considering only bits up to position k.

Apply memoization by storing previously computed values in a dictionary.

Initialize dp[0][0] = 1 and for each bit from left to right:
    Initialize a variable last_j as -1.
    For all possible values of j (from 0 to 2^k-1):
        If the i-th number has a bitwise AND with j, and the previous bits match up to position k:
            dp[i][j] = 1
            Update last_j
        Else:
            dp[i][j] = 0

Count the number of arrays that satisfy the condition: 
    For each array:
        Initialize count as 0.
        For all elements in the array:
            If the bitwise AND operation on all elements is greater than or equal to the bitwise XOR operation:
                Increment count
        Print count % (10^9 + 7)
