===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency.

Let dp[i][mask] be the number of arrays that satisfy the condition up to the ith bit and mask (the bitwise AND result of all previous elements).

The base case would be when i exceeds k or there are no more bits to consider. In this case, we simply return 1 if mask >= (all bits set in XOR operation) and 0 otherwise.

We can formulate the state as dp[i][mask] = sum(dp[j][mask^(2^j-1)] for j from i-1 down to 0).

This would allow us to count the number of arrays that satisfy the condition up to the ith bit and mask.

The final answer is the sum over all possible masks of dp[k][mask].
