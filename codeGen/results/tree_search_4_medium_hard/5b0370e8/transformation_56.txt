===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency.
Let dp[(1 << k) - 1][k + 1] be an array where dp[mask][i] represents the count of arrays with bitwise AND result mask at position i.

The state expression could be a pair (mask, i), where mask is the current bitwise AND result of all previous elements and i is the current bit position we're considering.
The base case would be when i exceeds k or there are no more bits to consider. At this point, if the bitwise AND result is 0, then it doesn't matter what the numbers are, so return 1; otherwise, return 0.

To fill up the dp array, for each mask and i:
- If i exceeds k, just use the previous dp[mask][i - 1] values.
- Otherwise, calculate the bitwise AND of all current bits. If it matches with the given mask, then you can have either XOR or AND operation depending on whether the current bit is set (1) or unset (0).
- For each possible number less than 2^k that could be at position i:
    - Calculate the new mask by doing bitwise AND of all current bits with the possible number.
    - If the bitwise AND result matches the given mask, then either XOR or AND operation is valid depending on whether the bit is set (1) or unset (0). Add dp[new_mask][i - 1] to this count.
- Return the total count.

This bottom-up approach iteratively updates the states in a loop and uses bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states, making it efficient.
