===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize recursive function calls by storing intermediate results in a dictionary.

State:
    dp[i]: the number of arrays with bitwise AND less than bitwise XOR up to index i
    and whether it's possible to change the ith element to increase bitwise AND without decreasing bitwise XOR; 
    Base Case: False when i < 0

State:
    store the count of arrays satisfying the condition up to index i;
Transition:
    update this state by considering each possible value of the ith element and counting the arrays that satisfy the condition after its inclusion.
Determine the maximum bitwise AND for all elements less than 2^k and store it in a variable max_and, 
then calculate the number of ways to achieve this max_and using dynamic programming.

    for i from k-1 down to 0:
        if (1 << i) & max_and > 0:
            max_and = max_and ^ (1 << i)
            dp[i] = sum(dp[j] for j in range(i)) + 1
        else:
            max_and = max_and & ((1 << i) - 1)
            dp[i] = sum(dp[j] for j in range(i))
    return dp[0] % (10**9+7)
