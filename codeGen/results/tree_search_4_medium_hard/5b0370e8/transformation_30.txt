===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up a table, where each entry represents the result of a subproblem.
The state is a tuple (i, j) representing the number of ways to form an array with i elements where all bitwise AND operations are greater than or equal to k-j.
Consider the transition from state (i-1, j) to state (i, j). If there exists an integer x such that 0 <= x < 2^k and the bitwise AND operation on x and each element in the array with i-1 elements is greater than or equal to k-j, then increment the value of dp[i][j] by the number of ways to form an array with i-1 elements where all bitwise AND operations are greater than or equal to k-(j+1).
The base case is when i = 0. The state (0, j) represents the number of ways to form an empty array. This value is always 1.
Dynamic programming can be implemented by initializing a table dp of size (n+1) * (k+1), where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to form an array with i elements where all bitwise AND operations are greater than or equal to j.
Initialize dp[0][j] for 0 <= j < k+1 as follows: dp[0][0] = 1, and dp[0][j] = 0 for 1 <= j < k+1. This is because there is only one way to form an empty array (i.e., the empty array itself), but there are no arrays with bitwise AND operations greater than or equal to any j > 0.
For each i from 1 to n, initialize dp[i][j] for 0 <= j < k+1 as follows: If j >= k, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][k]. This is because all bitwise AND operations on an array with i elements are greater than or equal to k if and only if the last element in the array is 2^k - 1.
For each j from 0 to k-1, calculate dp[i][j] as follows: If there exists an integer x such that 0 <= x < 2^k and the bitwise AND operation on x and each element in the array with i-1 elements is greater than or equal to k-j, then increment dp[i][j] by the number of ways to form an array with i-1 elements where all bitwise AND operations are greater than or equal to k-(j+1).
Finally, return the value of dp[n][k].
