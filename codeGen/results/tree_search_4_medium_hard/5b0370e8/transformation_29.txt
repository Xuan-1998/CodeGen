===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up a table, where each entry represents the number of ways to form an array with i elements such that all bitwise AND operations are greater than or equal to j.

The state is a tuple (k, j) representing the number of ways to form an array with k-j elements where all bitwise AND operations are greater than or equal to j. The base case is when k = 0.

Design a recursive function that uses memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid overlapping calculations.

Consider the state as (k, i) representing the number of ways to form an array with k-i elements where all bitwise XOR operations are greater than or equal to i. The base case is when k = 0.

The dynamic programming function will recursively calculate the result for each state and store it in a memoization table. This way, we avoid calculating the same subproblem multiple times.

To count the number of arrays that satisfy the condition, iterate through all possible values of i from 0 to n-1 and sum up the results of the dynamic programming function for each i.

Finally, return the count modulo 10^9+7.
