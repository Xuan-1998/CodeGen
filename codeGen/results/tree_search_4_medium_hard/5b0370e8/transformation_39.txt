===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up a table, where each entry represents the result of a subproblem. The state is a boolean indicating whether the current bit of the bitwise AND operation is set and the base case is when all bits are unset.

DP on number of bits set: we can count the number of bits set in both AND and XOR results separately and find the condition that relates them. This will help us determine how many arrays satisfy the condition for each subproblem.

Create a table to store the dynamic programming states using a dictionary, where keys are tuples representing the state and values are the counts of satisfying arrays.

For each number from 0 to k-1 (inclusive), calculate the AND and XOR results for all possible combinations of this bit being set or unset in the array. This can be done by considering two subcases: when the current bit is set, and when it's not.

In the table, store the counts of satisfying arrays for each state. This will help us determine how many arrays satisfy the condition for each subproblem.

Finally, iterate through all possible states to calculate the total count of satisfying arrays. This can be done by summing up the counts in the table based on the state and the base case when all bits are unset.
