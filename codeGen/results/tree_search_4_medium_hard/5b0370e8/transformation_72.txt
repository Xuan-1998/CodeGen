===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency.

The state expression could be simply the current bitwise AND result, and the base case would be when this result exceeds 2^k - 1. This is because for any given AND result, if it's greater than or equal to 2^k - 1, no further bitwise operations can increase the AND result.

A dynamic programming approach could involve iterating over all possible values for the bitwise AND result, and for each value, computing the corresponding bitwise XOR result and counting the arrays that satisfy the condition. This involves a simple loop with bit manipulation operations.

You can use a dictionary to store the memoized values, where each key is a tuple representing the state (i, j) and the value is the corresponding count. The initial memoization could be set as 0 for all states.

To improve efficiency, you can first initialize an array dp of size 2^k + 1 with all values being 0, then iterate over each possible AND result from 0 to 2^k - 1. For each AND result, calculate the corresponding XOR result using bitwise operations. Count the arrays that satisfy the condition for this AND result and update the memoization dictionary.

Finally, return the count modulo 10^9 + 7 as the output.
