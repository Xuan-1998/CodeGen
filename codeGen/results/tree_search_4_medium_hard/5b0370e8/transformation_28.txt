===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up a table, where each entry represents the result of a subproblem.

The state is a tuple (i, j) representing the number of ways to form an array with i elements where all bitwise AND operations are greater than or equal to k-j.
Consider the transition: if the last element in the array is x, then the remaining elements must be less than 2^k-x. The bitwise AND operation on these elements will be greater than or equal to k-1, which is equivalent to bitwise XOR operation being less than k.

The state is a tuple (i, j) representing the number of ways to form an array with i elements where all bitwise XOR operations are greater than or equal to j and less than k.
The base case is when i = 0: there is only one way to form such an array, which is the empty array.

Create a table with dimensions (k+1, j+1, n+1) and fill it up row by row using bottom-up dynamic programming.
The transition function for each cell (i, j) is the sum of the number of ways to form arrays where the last element is x and all bitwise AND operations are greater than or equal to k-1, and the number of ways to form arrays where the last element is 0 and all bitwise XOR operations are less than j.

The final answer is stored in cell (n, 0).
