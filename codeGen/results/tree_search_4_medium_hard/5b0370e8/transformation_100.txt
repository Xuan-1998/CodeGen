===BEGIN PLAN===
Combine bitwise operations with dynamic programming to efficiently count arrays.

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[m][j-1] * (all elements in the range [i-m, i) have a bitwise AND with j-1) for m from 0 to i
dp[i][j] = sum(dp[m][j-1] * (bitwise XOR of all elements in the range [i-m, i)) for m from 0 to i

Use a bottom-up approach to build up the solution by iterating over the range [0, 2^k)
