===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up a table, where each entry represents the result of a subproblem.

The state is a tuple (i, j) representing the number of ways to form an array with i elements where all bitwise AND operations are greater than or equal to k-j.

Consider the recurrence relation: Let dp[i][j] be the number of arrays with i elements that satisfy the condition. Then dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][x]) over all x such that j & (2^k - 1) <= x < j, where (a & b) is the bitwise AND operation.

The base case is when i = 0: dp[0][j] = 1 for any j, since there's only one way to form an array of length 0.
