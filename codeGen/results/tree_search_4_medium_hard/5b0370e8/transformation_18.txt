===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize recursive function calls by storing intermediate results in a dictionary.
State: 
    dp[i][j]: number of arrays with bitwise AND less than bitwise XOR up to index i, where j is possible values for ith element;
    prev_and, prev_xor: previous bitwise AND and XOR respectively; 
Base Case: False when i < 0
State:
    dp[0][j]: count of arrays satisfying the condition after considering each possible value of the 0th element;
Transition: update this state by considering each possible value for the ith element and counting the arrays that satisfy the condition after its inclusion.
Memoize the function calls based on the current array indices and store intermediate results in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

for i in range(n):
    dp[i][j] = 0
    for j in (0...(2**k) - 1):
        if bitwise_and(arr[:i], arr[i]) >= bitwise_xor(arr[:i], arr[i]):
            dp[i][j] += 1
        else:
            prev_and, prev_xor = bitwise_and(arr[:i], arr[i]), bitwise_xor(arr[:i], arr[i])
            for j in (0...(2**k) - 1):
                if bitwise_and([prev_and, j]) >= bitwise_xor([prev_and, j]):
                    dp[i][j] += 1
    return sum(dp[n-1])
