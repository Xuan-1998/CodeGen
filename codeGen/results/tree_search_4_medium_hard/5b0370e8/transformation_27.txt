===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up a table, where each entry represents the result of a subproblem.

The state is a tuple (k, j) representing the number of ways to form an array with k elements where all bitwise XOR operations are greater than or equal to j and less than 2^k. The base case is when k = 0.

Consider a dynamic programming approach by iterating over all possible values for j from 0 to 2^k - 1. For each value of j, iterate over all possible values for k-j from 0 to 2^(k-1) - 1 and update the table accordingly.

Use a dictionary to store intermediate results and avoid redundant computations.

The final answer can be calculated by summing up the values in the last row of the table. The result should be taken modulo 10^9+7.
