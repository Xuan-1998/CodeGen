===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency.
The state expression could be simply the current bitwise AND result, and the base case would be when this result exceeds 2^k - 1.

Consider a binary representation of the state as a bitstring where each bit represents whether the next bit in the AND operation is 0 or not.
Apply bitmasking to reduce the number of states and improve efficiency.

Iterate over all possible bitwise AND results from 0 to 2^k - 1:
    For each result, calculate the corresponding bitwise XOR result by flipping bits at positions where the AND result has a 1 bit.
    Count the number of arrays that satisfy the condition for this state (AND >= XOR).
    Memoize the count in a DP table using the state as the key.

The final answer is the sum of counts modulo 10^9+7 for all states exceeding 2^k - 1.
