===BEGIN PLAN===
Combine bitwise operations with dynamic programming to efficiently count arrays.
dp[i][j] = sum(dp[m][j-1] * (all elements in the range [i-m, i) have a bitwise AND with j-1) for m from 0 to i
Calculate the number of elements in each range that satisfy the condition and update dp[i][j].
For n=0, initialize dp[0][j] = 2^k (as all elements are zero and can be XORed with any value).
Bottom-up approach: iterate over all arrays [i], from i=k to 0, and for each array element j:
    Update dp[i][j] based on the previous values.
    Count the number of arrays that satisfy the condition for this bitwise AND operation.
Return the sum of all dp[i][k].
