===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency.

Consider two cases: when the current element is less than $2^k$, and when it's not.

For the first case, we can directly update the mask and i. The key insight here is that for any given bit position i, the bitwise AND result of all elements at or below this position only depends on the values at those positions.

To represent each possible array using its bitwise OR value, maintain a hash map to store the counts for each OR value. This would allow you to efficiently look up the count for any given OR value in O(1) time.

For the second case, we can consider two sub-cases: when the current element is equal to $2^k-1$, and when it's not.

In the first sub-case, since all elements are less than $2^k$, the bitwise AND result of all elements won't change. In the second sub-case, we can update the mask and i as before.

The base case would be when i exceeds k or there are no more bits to consider.

Maintain a 2D DP table where dp[i][mask] represents the count of arrays ending at position i with bitwise AND result mask.

Initialize the base case: dp[0][0] = 1, and all other entries in the first column to 0. This is because there's only one way to get an empty array (i.e., an array with no elements), which has bitwise AND result 0.

For each position i from 1 to k:
    For each possible mask from 0 to $2^k-1$:
        If the current element at position i is less than $2^k$, update dp[i][mask] based on the values of dp[i-1][current_element & mask] and dp[i-1][mask].

        If the current element at position i is equal to $2^k-1$, consider two sub-cases: when the bitwise AND result of all elements is less than or equal to mask, and when it's greater.

            For the first sub-case, update dp[i][mask] based on the values of dp[i-1][current_element & mask].

            For the second sub-case, update dp[i][mask] based on the values of dp[i-1][mask].

    Return the count modulo $10^9+7$.
