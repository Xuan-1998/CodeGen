===BEGIN PLAN===
Create a dictionary dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of arrays with bitwise AND greater than or equal to bitwise XOR up to index i, 
with k-j bits. Initialize all values in dp as 0.

State: The number of arrays with bitwise AND greater than or equal to bitwise XOR up to index i, 
with k-1 bits; Base Case: If i < 0, return 0.

Create a dictionary cnt where cnt[i][j] represents the count of numbers less than 2^k that have a certain value in their k-jth bit. Initialize all values in cnt as 0.

For each number x less than 2^k:

    For j from 0 to k-1:
        Calculate the total number of arrays that satisfy the condition considering all numbers up to this point. This could be done by iterating over the possible values of the current bit, 
            and for each value calculating the number of ways to fill the rest of the array.
