===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoize recursive function calls by storing intermediate results in a dictionary.

State: The number of ways to choose k-bit integers for the first i elements, 
       such that bitwise AND is greater than or equal to bitwise XOR; 
Base Case: 1 when i = 0 

Use a state variable that represents the maximum value that can be achieved in the bitwise AND operation for the first i elements, 
and use this value to determine the next possible states.

Store function calls by creating a dictionary with function arguments as keys and results as values. 
In each recursive call, calculate the maximum value of AND and XOR operations based on the previous state.
For every bit from k-1 to 0, for i-th element: 
    - Calculate AND operation result using all previous bits up to the current bit.
    - If this AND result is less than the XOR result (which is stored in the previous state), 
      recursively call the function with the updated state and add it to the dictionary. 

When calculating XOR, check if the number of 1s in the i-th element is even or odd.
If even, consider all possible combinations of AND results that are less than the XOR result.
If odd, only consider combinations where the last bit is 0 (since the XOR operation flips this bit).
Finally, return the sum of all stored values in the dictionary modulo 10^9 + 7.
