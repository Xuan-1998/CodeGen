===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency.

Let dp[i][x] be the number of arrays that satisfy the condition up to index i with bitwise XOR result x. Then, for each array element x (0 <= x < 2^k), we can consider two cases:
1) If x is even, then the bitwise AND operation on all elements will not increase.
2) If x is odd, then the bitwise AND operation on all elements will increase by at least one.

So, dp[i][x] = sum(dp[j][y] for j from 0 to i-1 and y in [0, x]) + (if x is even, 1 else 0).

This way we can calculate dp[n][x] as the answer. Finally, return dp[n][x]%10^9+7.
