===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency.

Define a state (i, x, y) where i is the current bit position we're considering, and x and y are the bitwise XOR and AND results respectively. This would allow you to handle the possibility of different numbers having the same bitwise AND result but different bitwise XOR results.

Initialize a dictionary dp with default value 0.

Base case: when i exceeds k or there are no more bits to consider, return 1 if x >= y else 0.

For each bit position i from k-1 down to 0:
    For each possible mask in range(2**k):
        If the i-th bit of mask is 1:
            Calculate new XOR and AND results for the current set of numbers considering the i-th bit.
            Update dp[(i+1, x^mask, y&mask)] with the sum of values from the base case and previously calculated values in dp.

Return dp[(0, 0, (2**k)-1)] modulo 10^9 + 7.
