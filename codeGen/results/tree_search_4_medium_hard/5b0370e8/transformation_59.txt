===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency.
The state expression could be a pair (i, mask), where i is the current bit position we're considering and mask is the current bitwise AND result of all previous elements. The base case would be when i exceeds k or there are no more bits to consider.

State: (i, cnt) where i is the current bit position and cnt is the number of elements with 1 at that position.
Formulate the problem as a recursive function and use dynamic programming to reduce the time complexity.
