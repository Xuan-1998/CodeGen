===BEGIN PLAN===
Combine bitwise operations with dynamic programming to efficiently count arrays.

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[m][j-1] * (all elements in the range [i-m, i) have a bitwise AND with j-1) for m from 0 to i
dp[i][j] = sum(dp[m][j-1] * (bitwise XOR of all elements in the range [i-m, i)) for m from 0 to i

Let's analyze this plan step by step:

1. Initialize dp array with size (n+1) * (2^k + 1)
2. Iterate over each element in the input array:
    - Calculate bitwise AND of all elements before current index and bitwise XOR of all elements after current index
    - Update dp[i][j] accordingly

This plan is correct, but it can be improved by reducing the number of operations.

Potential issues with this plan:

* The plan assumes that the bitwise AND operation on all elements before a certain index and the bitwise XOR operation on all elements after that index do not depend on each other. This might not always be true.
* The plan does not handle edge cases such as when n is 0 or k is greater than the maximum possible value.

To improve this plan, we can consider the following:

* Instead of calculating bitwise AND and XOR for every element in the range [i-m, i), we can calculate them for every block of size m. This would reduce the number of operations.
* We should handle edge cases such as when n is 0 or k is greater than the maximum possible value.
