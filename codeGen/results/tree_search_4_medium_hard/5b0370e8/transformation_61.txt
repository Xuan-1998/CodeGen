===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency.

Define a state as a tuple (i, x) where i is the index of the array element being considered and x is the bitwise XOR result of all previous elements. The base case would be when i reaches n.

The key observation is that if two numbers have the same bitwise AND with some number y, then their bitwise XOR with y will also be the same. This allows us to group the states by their bitwise AND results and reduce the complexity from O(2^n) to O(k).

For each state (i, x), we can calculate the next possible bitwise XOR result as follows:
- If the current element is even, then the bitwise XOR result will increase.
- If the current element is odd, then the bitwise XOR result will decrease.

We can use dynamic programming to store and reuse the results for subproblems. The state transitions are as follows:
- If x >= y, then there is no need to consider the next element because the bitwise AND result has already exceeded the bitwise XOR result.
- Otherwise, we have two possibilities: either the next element will increase or decrease the bitwise XOR result.

The final answer can be calculated by summing up the results for all possible states modulo 10^9+7.
