===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming to fill up a table, where each entry represents the result of a subproblem.
The state is a tuple (i, k-j) representing the number of ways to form an array with i elements where all bitwise AND operations are greater than or equal to k-j.
Consider the recurrence relation:
- If i = 0, there is only one way: an empty array. Store this in memo[0, k].
- For each possible j from k-1 down to 0, calculate the number of ways to form an array with i elements where all bitwise AND operations are greater than or equal to k-j.
	+ If j = 0, there is only one way: all elements being 0. Store this in memo[i, 0].
	+ For each possible last bit from (k-1) down to 0:
		- Calculate the number of ways to form an array with i-1 elements where all bitwise AND operations are greater than or equal to k-(j+1).
		- Add the product of this and the number of possible last bits to memo[i, j].
- The answer is the sum of memo[n, k] for each k from 0 to k.
