===BEGIN PLAN===
Use bit manipulation to reduce the number of possible states and improve memoization efficiency.

Let's define dp[i] as the count of arrays with bitwise AND result i.

Base case: When the bitwise AND result exceeds 2^k - 1, there are no more arrays that satisfy the condition, so dp[2^k-1] = 0.

Transition function: For each possible bitwise AND result i, compute the corresponding bitwise XOR result j. If all elements in the array have bitwise AND result i and bitwise XOR result j, then the number of such arrays is equal to the product of the counts of arrays with bitwise AND results i and j.

Initialize dp[0] = 1, because there is exactly one array that satisfies the condition when the bitwise AND result is 0.

For each possible bitwise AND result i from 1 to 2^k - 1:
    Calculate the corresponding bitwise XOR result j.
    If all elements in the array have bitwise AND result i and bitwise XOR result j, then increment dp[i] by dp[j].
    Otherwise, dp[i] = 0.

Finally, return the count of arrays that satisfy the condition, which is equal to dp[2^k-1].
