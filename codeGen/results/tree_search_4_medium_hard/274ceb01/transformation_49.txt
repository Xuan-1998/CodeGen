Define dp[i][k] as the minimum number of marks below water level on day i when the water level is at height k.
Base cases: dp[0][k] = 0 and dp[i][0] = i for all i, since no marks are below water if the water level is at height 0 or there's no water yet.
Designing a recursive function that uses memoization to avoid redundant computation and optimize the solution.
