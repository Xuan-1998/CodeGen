The optimal solution depends on the number of marks strictly above the water level on previous days, making it a natural fit for dynamic programming.

The state expression could be:
dp[i]: minimum sum of marks below water level after considering the current day i,
where dp[i] depends on max{k: 0 ≤ k < m} dp[j-1][k] for all j < i and min{m: 0 ≤ m ≤ n} m.
This ensures that we consider the maximum number of marks strictly above the water level on previous days and the current day.

The base case could be dp[0] = 0, since there are no days to consider initially.

Dynamic programming with a 1D array to store dp[i], where dp[i] represents the minimum sum of marks below water level after considering the current day i.
