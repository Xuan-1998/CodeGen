===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into subproblems of finding the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level for each prefix of days, with overlapping subproblems.

Define dp[i] as the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level at the end of day i.
dp[i] is calculated as the minimum of two cases: 
- The current number of marks strictly above the water (m_i) plus the minimum number of marks strictly below the water for all previous days (dp[i-1])
- The minimum number of marks strictly below the water level at the end of day i-1 (dp[i-1]) if no new mark is added to the current day

Using a 1D array dp to store the dynamic programming values, where dp[i] represents the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level at the end of day i.

The base case for the problem is when there are no days (i.e., n = 0), in which case the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level is 0.
