===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution depends on the number of marks strictly above the water level on previous days, making it a natural fit for dynamic programming.

The state expression could be:
dp[i][k]: minimum sum of marks below water level after considering the current day i and having k marks above water,
where dp[i][k] depends on dp[j][m] for all j < i and 0 ≤ m ≤ j, with boundary condition dp[0][0] = 0.

The hybrid approach: Implement tabulation for memoizing computed values and dynamic programming for building up the solution from previous days.

Dynamic Programming algorithm:

1. Create a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (n+1), where n is the number of days, to store the minimum sum of marks below water level after considering each day.
2. Initialize dp[0][k] = 0 for all k, since there are no marks above water on the first day.
3. For each i from 1 to n:
    a. For each k from 0 to i:
        i. Calculate the minimum sum of marks below water level after considering the current day i and having k marks above water as:
            dp[i][k] = min(dp[j][m]) + (i - j) * m for all j < i and 0 ≤ m ≤ j
        ii. Update dp[i][k] accordingly.
4. Return dp[n][n-1], which represents the minimum sum of marks below water level after considering all days.
