The optimal solution depends on the number of marks strictly above the water level on previous days, making it a natural fit for dynamic programming.

The state expression could be 'dp[i][k]: minimum sum of marks below water level after k marks above water on day i, considering the current day i.', where dp[i][k] depends on dp[j][m] for all j < i and 0 ≤ m ≤ k.
dp[k]: minimum sum of marks below water level given k marks above water, where dp[k] depends on dp[m] for all m < k.

Memoization: Define a recursive function that calculates dp[i][k] using dp[j][m] for all j < i and 0 ≤ m ≤ k, and use memoization to avoid repeated calculations. The base case would be when there are no marks above water (i.e., k = 0), in which case the minimum sum is simply the number of days.

To calculate dp[i][k], consider the following:
- If the current day has less than k marks, we can't satisfy the condition; thus, the minimum sum remains unchanged.
- If the current day has at least k marks, we can add these k marks to the previous day's result (dp[j][k-1] for the largest j < i) and subtract the marks strictly above water on the current day. The updated dp[i][k] would be this result plus the number of marks below water level for the current day.

The final answer is simply dp[n-1][n-1], as we want to find the minimum sum given n marks above water.
