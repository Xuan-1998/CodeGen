===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into subproblems of finding the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level for each prefix of days, with overlapping subproblems.

Define dp[i] as the sum of marks strictly below the water level for days 1 to i, and minimize this value. The base case is when i = 0, in which case dp[0] = 0.

The recurrence relation can be written as:

dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + (n - i) + sum(m_k for k in range(1, i)) if i > 0 else 0)

To avoid redundant computations and improve efficiency, we use a hybrid approach by combining bottom-up dynamic programming with memoization.

The final solution involves initializing dp[0] to 0, then iterating from i = 1 to n. For each day, calculate the minimum sum of marks below water level using the recurrence relation above, and update dp[i].

Finally, return dp[n], which represents the minimum possible sum of the number of marks strictly below the water level among all days.
