The optimal solution depends on the number of marks strictly above the water level on previous days, making it a natural fit for dynamic programming.

Let dp[i] be the minimum sum of marks below water level among the first i days. Then, we have:

dp[i] = min(dp[j] + (i - j) * m_{j+1}) for all j < i

where m_{j+1} is the number of marks strictly above the water level on day j+1.

This expression is based on the intuition that the minimum sum of marks below water level among the first i days can be achieved by considering the minimum sum of marks below water level among the first j days, and then adding the number of marks strictly above the water level on day j+1.

We initialize dp[0] to 0, since there are no marks below water level when there are no days yet.

Finally, we return dp[n], which is the minimum sum of marks below water level among all n days.
