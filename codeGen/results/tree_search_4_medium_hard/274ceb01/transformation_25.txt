The optimal solution depends on the number of marks strictly above the water level on previous days, making it a natural fit for dynamic programming.
'for all j < i' should be replaced with '0 ≤ j < i'

dp[i]: minimum sum of marks below water level on day i', where dp[i] depends on dp[j] for 0 ≤ j < i.

To calculate dp[i], iterate over all days j from 1 to i-1, and update dp[i] with the minimum value between its current value and (i - j) * m_j + dp[j]
