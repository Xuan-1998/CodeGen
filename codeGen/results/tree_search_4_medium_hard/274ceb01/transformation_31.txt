The optimal solution depends on the number of marks strictly above the water level on previous days, making it a natural fit for dynamic programming.
The state expression could be 'dp[i-1][k]: minimum sum of marks below water level after k marks above water on day i-1, considering the current day i.', where dp[i-1][k] depends on dp[j-1][m] for all j < i and 0 ≤ m ≤ j.
dp[i]: minimum sum of marks below water level after considering the current day i, where dp[i] depends on dp[j] for all j < i.
Memoization using a recursive function that calculates dp[i] based on previous values of dp[j] for all j < i.
Let's initialize dp[0][k] = k * (k + 1) / 2 for 0 ≤ k ≤ n-1, as the minimum sum of marks below water level after k marks above water on day 0 is indeed k * (k + 1) / 2.
Then, we calculate dp[i] based on dp[j] for all j < i using a recursive function. Specifically:
    dp[i] = min(dp[j] + (n - j) - k) for all j < i and 0 ≤ k ≤ n-j
This way, we ensure that we consider all possible combinations of marks above water level on previous days to calculate the minimum sum of marks below water level after considering the current day i.
Finally, return dp[n-1] as the minimum possible sum of the number of marks strictly below the water level among all days.
