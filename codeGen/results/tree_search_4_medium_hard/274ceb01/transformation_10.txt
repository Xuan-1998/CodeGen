===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into subproblems of finding the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level for each prefix of days, with overlapping subproblems.

Define dp[i] as the sum of marks strictly below the water level for days 1 to i, and minimize this value.
Let's initialize dp[0] = 0 since there are no marks below the water level initially.

For i > 0:
    For j in range(i):
        If m_j < j:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j - 1] + (i - j) * m_i - dp[j - 1])

The plan minimizes the sum of marks strictly below the water level by considering all possible prefixes and choosing the one with the minimum sum.
