===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into subproblems of finding the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level for each prefix of days, with overlapping subproblems.

Define dp[i] as the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level at the end of day i.
dp[i] is the minimum of the current number of marks strictly above the water and the minimum number of marks strictly below the water for all previous days.

For day 1, the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level is simply the difference between the marks on day 1 and the total marks so far (which is just the mark on day 1).

Then, for each subsequent day i > 1:
    - Calculate the current number of marks strictly above the water as max(0, m_i - m_{i-1}) where m_i is the mark on day i.
    - Update dp[i] to be the minimum of this current number and the minimum number of marks strictly below the water for the previous day (dp[i-1]).

Implementing a list dp with initial length n, then iterating through each day and updating the corresponding value based on the previous day's result.
