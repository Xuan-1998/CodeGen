===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[n][k] = min(dp[i-1][0] + n*(i-k) for i in range(1, k+1)) if k > 0 else None
Create a memo dictionary that maps each number of days n to its corresponding optimal solution for the minimum sum of marks strictly below the water level.
Initialize memo with default value as infinity
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where dp[i][k] depends only on the values of dp[j][l] where j<i and l<k.
For each day i, iterate over possible values of k from 1 to i, and for each value of k:
    Calculate the minimum sum of marks strictly below the water level using the current memo values
    Update memo with the calculated result
Return memo[n]
