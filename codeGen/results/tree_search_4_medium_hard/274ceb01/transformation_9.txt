===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into subproblems of finding the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level for each prefix of days, with overlapping subproblems.

Define dp[i] as the sum of marks strictly below the water level for days 1 to i, and minimize this value. The recurrence relation becomes:
dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + m_i - dp[j] for j in range(1, i) if m_j < j)

This is because we need to find the minimum sum of marks below the water level on days 1 to i. We can do this by considering all possible positions of the water level on day i. The minimum sum is achieved when the water level is at its lowest possible position.

To use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach, where the solution is built from smaller subproblems recursively:
dp[0] = 0 (base case)
for i in range(1, n):
    dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + m_i - dp[j] for j in range(1, i) if m_j < j)

The final answer is dp[n-1]
