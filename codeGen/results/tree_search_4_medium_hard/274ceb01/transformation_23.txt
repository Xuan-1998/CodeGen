===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution depends on the number of marks strictly above the water level on previous days, making it a natural fit for dynamic programming.

The state expression could be 'dp[i]: minimum sum of marks below water level on day i', where dp[i] depends on dp[j] for all j < i.
dp[i]: minimum sum of marks below water level on day i, given the number of marks above water level on previous days

Tabulation with Memoization: Use a dictionary memo to store previously computed values.

For each day i, calculate the minimum sum of marks below water level by iterating through all previous days j < i and considering the number of marks strictly above the water level on day j. The minimum sum for day i would be the minimum sum calculated from previous days plus the number of marks strictly below the water level on day i.

Update memo with the calculated dp[i] value to avoid redundant calculations in the future.
