dp[i][k]: minimum sum of marks below water level after considering the current day i and having k marks above water.
The state expression could be 'dp[i-1][k]: minimum sum of marks below water level after k marks above water on day i, making it a natural fit for dynamic programming.'
Memoization using a dictionary to store computed values and avoid redundant calculations.
For each day i, iterate from 0 to i-1 and calculate dp[i][k] = min(dp[j][m] + (i - j - 1) * m) for all j < i and 0 ≤ m ≤ j.
Return dp[n-1][n].
