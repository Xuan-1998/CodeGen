===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem's structure lends itself well to memoization, where we store and reuse previously computed values to avoid redundant computation.

dp[n][k] = min(dp[i-1][0] + (n-i)*i for i in range(1, k+1)) if k > 0 else n
Create a dynamic programming array where each cell represents the minimum number of marks below water level on day i with water level at height k.

The base case is when k == 0, we should return n as there are no marks above the water.
We can use tabulation by defining a 2D array and initializing it accordingly. Then, we can fill this array in a bottom-up manner.

Finally, we return dp[n][n] which represents the minimum possible sum of the number of marks strictly below the water level among all days.
