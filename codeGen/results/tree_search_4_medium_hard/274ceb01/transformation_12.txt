===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into subproblems of finding the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level for each prefix of days, with overlapping subproblems.

Define dp[i] as the minimum number of marks strictly above the water level at the beginning of day i.
Initialize dp[0] = 0.

The state is dp[i], which represents the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level by the end of day i.

dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + (i - j) - m_j, dp[j]) for j in range(1, i+1)
where m_j is the number of marks strictly above the water on day j.
The optimal substructure property holds since we only consider the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level up to day j.

The plan includes edge cases because dp[0] = 0 represents the base case where there are no days, and the recursive formula handles all other cases.
