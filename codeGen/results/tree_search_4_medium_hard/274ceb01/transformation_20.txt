===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into subproblems of finding the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level for each prefix of days, with overlapping subproblems.

Define dp[i] as the minimum number of marks strictly above the water level at the beginning of day i.
dp[0] is 0 since there are no marks initially.

The state transition is based on the minimum number of marks strictly above the water level at the beginning of previous days. Let's say we're trying to find dp[i]. We can do this by considering two cases:

- If m_i (marks on day i) is greater than or equal to i, then there are no marks strictly below the water level. So, dp[i] = 0.
- If m_i < i, then we need to consider the minimum number of marks strictly above the water level at the beginning of day i - 1 (dp[i - 1]) and add the difference between i and m_i to it.

Implement tabulation by initializing an array with n+1 zeros and filling it up iteratively from left to right, using the minimum number of marks strictly above the water level at the beginning of previous days.
dp[0] = 0
for i from 1 to n:
    if m[i] >= i: dp[i] = 0
    else: dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (i - m[i])
return dp[n]
