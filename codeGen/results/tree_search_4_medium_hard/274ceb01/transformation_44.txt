===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem's structure lends itself well to memoization, where we store and reuse previously computed values to avoid redundant computation.

dp[n][k] = min(dp[k-1][0], dp[k-1][k]) + (n-k)*k if k > 0 else n
Create a dynamic programming array where each cell represents the minimum number of marks below water level on day i with water level at height k.
Memoize previously computed values to avoid redundant computation.

For edge cases, we need to consider when k is 0. In this case, dp[k-1][k] will be None, so we should set dp[0][0] = 0, as the minimum number of marks below water level on day i with water level at height 0 is 0.
