===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution depends on the number of marks strictly above the water level on previous days, making it a natural fit for dynamic programming.

The state expression could be 'dp[i]: minimum sum of marks below water level on day i', where dp[i] depends on dp[j] for all j < i.

dp[j]: total marks above water level up to j, used to calculate dp[i] for all i > j

To initialize the dynamic programming array dp, we set dp[0] = 0, since there are no marks strictly below the water level on day 0.

For each day i from 1 to n-1, calculate the minimum sum of marks below water level as follows:
dp[i]: min(dp[j] + (i - j - 1) * (j+1) for j in range(i))
This is because on day i, there are (i - j - 1) days with marks strictly above the water level since we started counting from day j.
The minimum sum of marks below water level would be the minimum sum among all possible choices of j.

Finally, return dp[n-1] as the result, which represents the minimum possible sum of the number of marks strictly below the water level among all days.
