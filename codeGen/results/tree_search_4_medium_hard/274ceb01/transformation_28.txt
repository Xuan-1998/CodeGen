===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution depends on the number of marks strictly above the water level on previous days, making it a natural fit for dynamic programming.

The state expression could be 'dp[i]: minimum sum of marks below water level on day i', where dp[i] depends on dp[j] for all j < i.
minimum possible sum of the number of marks strictly below the water level on day i is dp[i-1] + (n - i)

To use a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization, defining a recursive function that calls itself with smaller inputs until the base case is reached, then storing the results in a dictionary for later reuse.

The base case would be when i == 0 or i == n, where the minimum sum of marks below water level on day i is 0.

A more efficient approach could be to use bottom-up dynamic programming, defining dp[i] recursively based on dp[j] for j < i-1, and then iteratively update dp[i] from left to right. This way, we can avoid redundant calculations.
