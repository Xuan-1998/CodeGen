===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into subproblems of finding the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level for each prefix of days, with overlapping subproblems.

Define dp[i] as the minimum number of marks strictly above the water level at the end of day i.
The state transition is based on the minimum number of marks strictly above the water level at the beginning of previous days. For each day i, the minimum number of marks strictly above the water level at the end of day i is equal to the minimum number of marks strictly above the water level at the beginning of day i minus the number of marks strictly above the water level on day i.

Create a dynamic programming table with n+1 entries, where each entry represents the minimum number of marks strictly above the water level at the end of day i.
Initialize dp[0] to 0, since there are no marks above the water level initially.
For each day i from 1 to n:
    Calculate dp[i] as dp[i-1] minus m_i (the number of marks strictly above the water level on day i).
Return dp[n] as the minimum possible sum of the number of marks strictly below the water level among all days.
