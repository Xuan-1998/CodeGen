===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal solution depends on the number of marks strictly above the water level on previous days, making it a natural fit for dynamic programming.

The state expression could be 'dp[i]: minimum sum of marks below water level on day i', where dp[i] depends on dp[j] for all j < i.
dp[i]: minimum sum of marks below water level on day i, given the number of marks above water level on previous days

Dynamic Programming with Tabulation:
Initialize a list dp of size n+1 and fill it using a bottom-up approach
    - For each day i from 2 to n (inclusive):
        - Calculate the number of marks strictly below water level for that day as: total_marks_above_water_level_on_prev_days * (i-1) - total_marks_above_water_level_on_prev_days
        - Update dp[i] with the minimum sum calculated above, considering all previous days j < i
    - Return dp[n] as the minimum possible sum of marks strictly below water level among all days
