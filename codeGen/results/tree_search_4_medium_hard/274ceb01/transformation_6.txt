===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into subproblems of finding the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level for each prefix of days, with overlapping subproblems.

Define dp[i] as the sum of marks strictly below the water level for days 1 to i, and minimize this value. The correct recurrence relation is:

dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + (n-i) - (sum(m_k for k in range(1, i)) - m_{i})) if i > 0 else 0

This is because the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level for days 1 to i can be obtained by considering two options: either include the current day's marks or not. If we don't include the current day's marks, we consider the previous day's marks and add (n-i) new marks that appear after the current day. If we do include the current day's marks, we subtract m_{i} from the sum of marks strictly above the water level.

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by creating an array dp of size n+1 to store the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level for each day, with dp[0] initialized to 0.
