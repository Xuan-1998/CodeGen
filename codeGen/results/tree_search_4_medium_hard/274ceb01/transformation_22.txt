===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i]: minimum sum of marks below water level on day i
The state expression could be dp[i] = min_sum_below_water(i), where dp[i] depends on dp[j] for all j < i.

function min_sum_below_water(i):
    if i == 1:
        return m_1
    else:
        min_sum = INF
        for j in range(1, i):
            min_sum = min(min_sum, dp[j] + (i - j - 1) * m_i)
        return min_sum

Memoization: Define a function min_sum_below_water that takes i as input and returns the minimum sum
of marks below water level on day i, given the number of marks above water level on previous days.

Let's consider some edge cases:
* If n is 1, then we have only one mark above the water level. So, dp[0] = m_0.
* If n is greater than or equal to 2, then for each day i > 1, dp[i] depends on dp[j] for all j < i.

This plan includes edge cases and it's correct in terms of using dynamic programming with memoization. It can be improved by optimizing the function min_sum_below_water(i) to reduce its time complexity.
