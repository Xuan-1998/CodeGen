===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into subproblems of finding the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level for each prefix of days, with overlapping subproblems.

Define dp[i] as the minimum number of marks strictly above the water level at the beginning of day i.
dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + m_i - sum(m_k for k in range(j)) for j in range(1, i+1)) if i > 0 else m_0
