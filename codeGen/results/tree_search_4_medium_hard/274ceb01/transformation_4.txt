===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into subproblems of finding the minimum number of marks strictly below the water level for each prefix of days, with overlapping subproblems.

Define dp[i] as the sum of marks strictly below the water level for days 1 to i, and minimize this value. This can be calculated recursively by considering all possible water levels that could have been present at the end of day i-1, which would then affect the number of marks strictly below the water level on day i.

For each such water level, calculate the total marks above the water level, which is (i - m_i). Add this to the minimum sum of marks below the water level for days 1 to i-1. This gives us dp[i].

However, we need to consider all possible previous water levels that could have been present at the end of day j < i, where m_j < i. For each such water level, calculate the total marks above the water level, which is (i - j). Add this to the minimum sum of marks below the water level for days 1 to j, and subtract m_j from it.

The final calculation becomes dp[i] = min(dp[j] - m_j + i - j for j in range(i) if m_j < i) + (n - i)*m_i. Implement memoization by defining a recursive function that stores and reuses previously computed values to avoid redundant computation.
