dp[n][k] = sum(1 for i in range(k)) if k == 0 else min(dp[k-1][i] + (n-k)*i for i in range(k))
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where dp[i][k] depends only on the values of dp[j][l] where j<i and l<k.
Memoize the function using a dictionary to store previously computed values, where the key is the number of days and the value is another dictionary that stores the minimum sum for each possible water level.
dp[0][0] = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
    dp[i][0] = 0

        dp[i][j] = min(dp[k-1][i-j] + (n-k)*i for k in range(j))
