1. The initial state should be initialized as follows:
   dp[0][j][k] = 1 if k == j and 0 otherwise.

2. Base case: If a[i] is not divisible by i, then there are no good subsequences, so set dp[i][j][k] = 0 for all k.
3. Recursive function:
   For each k from 1 to a[i]:
     if a[i] % k == 0 and (i > j-1 or dp[i-1][j-1][k-1] == 1):
       dp[i][j][k] = dp[i][j][k] + dp[i-1][j-1][k-1]

4. Main function:
   Initialize an array dp with n+1 rows and a maximum of 10^6 columns.
   Call the recursive function to fill in the array.

5. Output:
   Return the sum of dp[n][j][a[i]] for j from 1 to a[i]. This will give us the number of good subsequences ending at each index i, with the last element being a[i].
