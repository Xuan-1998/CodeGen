Since the problem involves checking divisibility, it might be more efficient to use tabulation to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.

Consider the state as a tuple (i, last_divisor), where i is the length of the subsequence and last_divisor is the largest divisor of the last element in the subsequence.
State: (i, last_divisor) represents whether the last i elements in a are divisible by last_divisor.

To create a hash table to store intermediate results and look up previous computations. For each state (i, last_divisor), we can calculate the number of good subsequences ending at that point based on the information stored in the hash table. This would allow us to efficiently avoid recalculating subproblems.

This plan seems correct and should give a good starting point for solving this problem.
The main potential issue is that it might be too slow if there are many repeated calculations, so we need to make sure our hashing strategy is efficient.
The plan does include edge cases like checking the divisibility of each element in the subsequence. This could also be improved by storing an additional state (i-1, last_divisor) which represents whether the last i-1 elements are divisible by last_divisor and using that to avoid redundant calculations.
