===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves finding the number of good subsequences, which seems to be a function of the current element and the previous subsequence lengths. This suggests that memoization could be effective.

The state expression defines the count of good subsequences that can be extended by appending a[i], given that it's divisible by i. The base case handles when i is 1 and we only consider sequences with length 0.

Define the state as (i, k) where i is the current element, and k is the number of elements before it. This state captures whether the current element can be appended to a good subsequence considering the previous subsequences.

Use dynamic programming to solve this problem with a tabulation approach using a 1D array dp where dp[i] represents the number of good subsequences ending at index i that can be extended by appending a[i].

Iterate over each element in the array and update the state accordingly. Initialize dp[0] as 1, since a subsequence of length 0 is always considered good.

For each subsequent element i, calculate the number of good subsequences ending at index i-1 that can be extended by appending a[i]. This is achieved by iterating over previous elements j where j is divisible by i and adding dp[j].

Finally, return dp[n] as the total count of good subsequences in the array.
