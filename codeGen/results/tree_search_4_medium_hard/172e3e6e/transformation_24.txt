===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves finding the number of good subsequences, which seems to be a function of the current element and the previous subsequence lengths. This suggests that memoization could be effective.

State: Whether or not the subsequence ending at index i can be extended to include a[i]. Base case: If i > 0, then this state is determined by whether a[i] is divisible by i + 1.

State: dp[i] = the number of good subsequences ending at index i. Transition relationship: dp[i] = sum(dp[j]*len(range(j+1, i+1)) for j in range(i) if a[i]%j == 0)

Implement an iterative function that computes dp[i] based on the transition relationship and uses memoization to avoid redundant computations.

For each element a[i], check whether it is divisible by i + 1. If it is, recursively count the number of good subsequences ending at indices less than i. For each such j, consider all possible ranges from j + 1 to i, including j + 1 itself. Add up the counts for these ranges and add them to the total count.

To avoid redundant computations, use a dictionary memo to store the counts of good subsequences ending at previous indices. Before computing dp[i], check if dp[j] is already computed for some j < i, and if so, return the stored value directly.

Return the final count modulo 10^9 + 7.
