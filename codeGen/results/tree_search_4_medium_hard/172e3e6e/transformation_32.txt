===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming and combinatorics. Here's an updated plan:

The state expression is dp[i][j] = the number of good subsequences of length j that end at index i, and the base case is dp[0][0] = 1.

For i > 0 or j > 0:
    dp[i][0] = 1 if a[i]%i == 0; otherwise, dp[i][0] = 0
    for j from 1 to i:
        dp[i][j] = product((i | a[j]%i == 0) for k in range(j+1)) * dp[i-1][j]
    dp[0][j] = sum(dp[i][j] for i in range(1, n+1))

The final answer is the sum of dp[i][n] for all i.
