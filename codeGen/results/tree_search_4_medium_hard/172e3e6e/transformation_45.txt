===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem involves checking divisibility, it might be more efficient to use tabulation to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.

Think about the state as a pair (dp[i], count), where dp[i] is 1 if the prefix ending at index i has all its elements divisible by their indices, and count is the number of elements that are divisible by their indices.
The initial state for the first element would be (0, 1) since only this single element satisfies the condition.

For each subsequent element at index j:
- If dp[j-1] == 1 and j is divisible by its value, then we can extend the good subsequence, so update dp[j] to 1 and increment count.
- Otherwise, we reset the state to (0, 0) since this new element breaks the divisibility condition.

Finally, sum up all counts modulo 10^9 + 7 to get the total number of good subsequences.
