===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves finding the number of good subsequences, which seems to be a function of the current element and the previous subsequence lengths. This suggests that memoization could be effective.

State: Whether or not the subsequence ending at index i can be extended to include a[i]. Base case: If i > 1, then this state is the same as the previous one because there are no subsequences that can be extended.

State: dp[i] = the number of good subsequences ending at index i.
Transition relationship: dp[i] = sum(dp[j]*len(range(j+1, i+1)) for j in range(i) if a[i]%i == 0)

Memoize the state dp[i] with respect to the problem's constraints and the base case.

For each i, we need to calculate dp[i]. We can use dynamic programming to build up the solution from smaller subproblems. This is because whether or not we can extend a good subsequence ending at index j to include a[i] only depends on whether a[i]%i == 0 for all i such that j < i.

This plan seems correct, but it's worth noting that calculating len(range(j+1, i+1)) might be slow and could lead to large values. A more efficient approach would be to calculate the sum of range(j+1, i+1) once for each i and store the result in an array dp2.

State: dp[i] = the number of good subsequences ending at index i.
Transition relationship: dp[i] = sum(dp[j]*dp2[j] for j in range(i) if a[i]%i == 0)

Here's the improved plan:
