The problem involves finding the number of good subsequences, which seems to be a function of the current element and the previous subsequence lengths. This suggests that memoization could be effective.

Define the state as (i, k) where i is the current element and k is the count of good subsequences that can be extended by appending a[i], given that it's divisible by i.

The base case handles when i is 1 and we only consider sequences with length 0. The transition function should calculate the number of good subsequences that can be extended by appending a[i], given that it's divisible by i, using the information from the previous subsequence lengths.

Determine if any additional state variables are needed to handle edge cases or optimize the solution.
