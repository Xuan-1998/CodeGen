===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by considering all possible lengths of subsequences and using dynamic programming to count the number of good subsequences for each length.

The state expression is dp[j] = the number of good subsequences of length j, and the base case is dp[0] = 1.

dp[i] = dp[i-1] + sum(dp[j] * (is_divisible(a[j:i+1], i) ? 1 : 0) for j in range(i)), where is_divisible(sub, k) returns 1 if all elements of sub are divisible by k, and 0 otherwise.

To implement a tabulation-based approach using a 2D array to store the dynamic programming state.

However, we need to handle the edge case when i is less than 1, since the range(i) will be empty in this case. We can add an if condition to check if i is greater than or equal to 1 before entering the loop.

dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (i >= 1 and sum(dp[j] * (is_divisible(a[j:i+1], i) ? 1 : 0) for j in range(i))).

This plan seems correct, but we need to be careful when handling the edge cases and ensuring that our dynamic programming state is correctly updated.
