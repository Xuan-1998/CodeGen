Since the problem involves checking divisibility, it might be more efficient to use tabulation to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state as a dictionary (i, divisors), where i is the current element's index and divisors are the list of divisors of the previous elements up to the current element.

State: (i, max_divisor) where i is the current index and max_divisor is the maximum divisor seen so far.

Using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems as you compute them

For each index i, calculate the maximum number of good subsequences ending at that index. This can be done by iterating over all previous elements j < i, checking if the current element i is divisible by the divisors of j, and summing up the number of good subsequences ending at j.

To avoid redundant calculations, use memoization to store the results of subproblems in a dictionary dp.

The final answer can be calculated as the sum of the maximum number of good subsequences ending at each index i.
