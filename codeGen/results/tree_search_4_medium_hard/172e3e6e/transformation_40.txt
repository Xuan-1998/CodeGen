===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i][j] be 1 if there exists a good subsequence ending at index i with the largest divisor j; otherwise, it's 0.

State transition: 
dp[i][j] = 1 if (a[i] % j == 0 && (i == 0 || dp[i-1][j] == 1)) 

Base case:
dp[0][j] = 1 for all j

Initialization:
For j from 1 to a[n], set dp[n][j] = 1 if a[n] % j == 0; otherwise, set it to 0

Combining states: 
Let res be the sum of dp[i][j] over all i and j. Then, res is the number of good subsequences.

Edge cases:
- If n or any ai exceeds 10^6, we need to handle this case.
- If the array contains only one element, return 1 because it's a good subsequence.

Improved plan:
- Use a hashmap to store the frequency of each ai % j for all j, so that you can find dp[i][j] in O(1).
- Update the base case and initialization accordingly.

Updated plan:

dp[0][j] = 1 for all j
For i from 1 to n:
    For j from 1 to a[i]:
        if a[i] % j == 0:
            dp[i][j] = 1 if (i == 0 || dp[i-1][j] == 1) else 0
res = sum(dp[i][j] for i, j in zip(range(n+1), range(1, max(a)+1)))
return res % (10^9 + 7)
