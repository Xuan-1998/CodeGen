===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves finding the number of good subsequences, which seems to be a function of the current element and the previous subsequence lengths. This suggests that memoization could be effective.

State: The number of good subsequences ending at index i with the last element being a[i]. Base case: If a[i] is not divisible by i, then there are no good subsequences.

State: dp[i] represents the number of good subsequences ending at index i. Transition: for each possible last element value k from 1 to i, check if a[i] is divisible by k, and update dp[i] accordingly.

Store the state in a list dp, where dp[i] represents the number of good subsequences ending at index i. Initialize dp[0] as 1 because there is always one way to form an empty subsequence (i.e., no elements).

For each i from 1 to n-1:
    Update dp[i] based on dp[i-1] and a[i]

Store the final result in dp[n-1]. This represents the number of good subsequences in the entire array.

Return dp[n-1] modulo 10^9 + 7 as the answer.
