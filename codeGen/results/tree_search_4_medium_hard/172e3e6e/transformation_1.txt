The problem involves finding the number of good subsequences, which seems to be a function of the current element and the previous subsequence lengths. This suggests that memoization could be effective.

State: The number of good subsequences ending at index i with the last element being a[i]. Base case: If a[i] is not divisible by i, then there are no good subsequences.

State: dp[i] represents the number of good subsequences ending at index i. Transition: for each possible last element value k, check if a[i] is divisible by k, and update dp[i] accordingly.

Memoize the state using a dictionary where the key is the subsequence length i and the value is the count of good subsequences ending at index i.

Transition: dp[i] += 1 if a[i] is divisible by i-1 for i > 1. This handles the case where the last element is the smallest divisor of a[i].

Handle edge cases:
- If i is 0, there are no good subsequences.
- If a[i] is not divisible by i, then there are no good subsequences.
