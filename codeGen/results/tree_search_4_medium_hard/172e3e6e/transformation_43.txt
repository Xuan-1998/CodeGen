===BEGIN PLAN===
Let's break down the problem into smaller subproblems:

1. Initialize a 2D table dp with dimensions (n+1) x (10^6+7), where n is the length of the array and 10^6+7 is an upper bound for the maximum value in the array.
2. For each prefix_sum from 0 to n, and count from 0 to 10^6+7:
   - If the current element a[i] is divisible by i (1 <= i <= count):
     - Set dp[prefix_sum][count] to 1 + sum of dp[j][k-1] for all j such that prefix_sum-j is divisible by j and k-1 <= k, where k is the number of elements in the subsequence.
   - Else:
     - Set dp[prefix_sum][count] to 0.

3. The answer will be the sum of dp[n][i] for i ranging from 1 to 10^6+7 modulo 10^9+7.
