===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by considering all possible lengths of subsequences and using dynamic programming to count the number of good subsequences for each length.

The state expression is dp[j] = the number of good subsequences of length j, and the base case is dp[0] = 1.

dp[i] = dp[i-1] + sum(dp[j] * (is_divisible(a[j:i+1], i) ? 1 : 0) for j in range(i))

where is_divisible(sub, k) returns 1 if all elements of sub are divisible by k, and 0 otherwise.

To implement a hybrid approach combining both tabulation and memoization, we can maintain two arrays dp and temp. Initially, dp[i] = 0 for i from 1 to n (inclusive). Then, for each i from 1 to n:

- Calculate the number of good subsequences ending at position i using the above formula.
- Update dp[i] with this value.

Finally, return dp[n]%10^9+7 as the result.
