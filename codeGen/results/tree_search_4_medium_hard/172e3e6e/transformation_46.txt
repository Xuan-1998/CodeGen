===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem involves checking divisibility, it might be more efficient to use tabulation to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.
Let dp[i][j] represent the number of good subsequences ending at index i with length j. 
Initially, dp[0][j] = 1 for all j >= 1 (since an empty subsequence is always considered a good subsequence).
Now consider the state as a pair (prefix, length), where prefix is the longest prefix of the current subsequence that has all its elements divisible by their indices, and length is the length of this prefix.
If we are considering a new element at index i with value a_i, it can be added to an existing good prefix if and only if a_i is divisible by its index. 
For each j from 1 to n:
    For each k from j to n:
        If all elements in the subsequence ending at index k are divisible by their indices (i.e., dp[k][j-1] > 0), then consider adding a_k to the good prefix.
            If a_k is divisible by its index, then update dp[k][j] = dp[k][j-1] + dp[k-j][j-1] for all j >= 1.
            Else, do nothing.
    Calculate the total number of good subsequences ending at each index i (i.e., calculate the sum of all dp[i][n] over n from 1 to i).
