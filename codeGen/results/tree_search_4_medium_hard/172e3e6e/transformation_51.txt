===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the state as a dictionary dp[i][divisors] where i is the current element's index and divisors are the list of divisors of the previous elements up to the current element.

The base case would be when there are no more elements in the array, then the number of good subsequences is 1 (the empty subsequence).

To calculate dp[i][divisors], iterate over all numbers j from 1 to i, and for each j:

* If j divides the current number a[i], then add 1 to the total count of good subsequences that include j.
* If j does not divide the current number a[i], then skip this j.

Then, update dp[i][divisors] with the sum of all counts from previous elements whose divisors include j (i.e., j is a divisor of any number in the array up to i).

Finally, return dp[-1][[]] as the total count of good subsequences.

The time complexity would be O(n * m), where n is the length of the array and m is the maximum number that appears in the array. The space complexity would be O(n * m) for storing the dynamic programming table.
