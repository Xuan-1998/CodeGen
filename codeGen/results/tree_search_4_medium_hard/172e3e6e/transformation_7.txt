The problem involves finding the number of good subsequences, which seems to be a function of the current element and the previous subsequence lengths. This suggests that dynamic programming with memoization could be effective.

State Expression: 
Let dp[(i, pre)] be the count of good subsequences that can be extended by appending i, given that it's divisible by i, with the previous longest length being pre.
Base Case: 
When i is 1, we only consider sequences with length 0. So, dp[(1, 0)] = 1 and for any other (i, pre), dp[(i, pre)] = 0.

Define the state as ((i, pre)) where i is the current element and pre is the previous subsequence length.
Use a dictionary-based memoization approach, defining each key-value pair as ((i, pre), count) and using get() to handle non-existent keys. The initial values should be set for (1, 0) = 1 and any other ((i, pre)) to 0.

For each i from 2 to n:
    For each pre from 0 to i-1:
        if a[i] is divisible by i:
            dp[(i, pre)] = sum(dp[(j, k)] for j in range(1, i) for k in range(pre+1)) + (pre == 0)
        else:
            dp[(i, pre)] = 0

The answer is the value of dp[(n, n-1)]
