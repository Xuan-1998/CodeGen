The plan is correct and shows good understanding of the problem. Here's an updated and refined version:

===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the state as (i, c) where i is the current element and c is the count of good subsequences that can be extended by appending a[i].
Create a dictionary memo to store the memoized values, with keys being tuples (i, c) and values being integers representing the count of good subsequences.
For each number i in range(n), 
    Initialize dp[(1, 0)] = 1 because there is one way to extend an empty sequence by appending a[1].
    Then for each j from 2 to i,
        If j divides a[i], update dp[(i, c + 1)] = (dp[(j - 1, c + 1)] + memo.get((j - 1, c), 0)) % (10^9 + 7).
    Else, update dp[(i, c)] = memo.get((i - 1, c), 0) % (10^9 + 7).
Return dp[(n, 0)] as the final answer.
===END PLAN===
