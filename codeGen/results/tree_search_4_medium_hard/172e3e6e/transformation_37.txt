===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a state as a tuple (i, last_divisor), where i is the length of the subsequence and last_divisor is the largest divisor of the last element in the subsequence.
Let dp[i][d] be 1 if there exists a good subsequence of length i with the last divisor being d. Otherwise, it's 0.

State transition: 
- If the last element of the current subsequence is divisible by d, then (i, d) transitions to (i-1, d).
- If the last element of the current subsequence is not divisible by any previous divisor up to d, then (i, d) transitions to (i-1, 0).

Base case: 
- For i = 1, dp[1][d] is 1 if the first element is divisible by d. Otherwise, it's 0.

Final answer:
- The number of good subsequences taken modulo 10^9 + 7 is the sum of dp[i][0] for all i from 1 to n.
