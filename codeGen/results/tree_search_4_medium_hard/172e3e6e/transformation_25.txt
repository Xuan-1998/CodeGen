===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by considering all possible lengths of subsequences and using dynamic programming to count the number of good subsequences for each length.

dp[i] = 0
for i in range(n+1):
    if i == 0:
        dp[i] = 1
    else:
        dp[i] = sum(dp[j] * (is_divisible(a[j:i+1], j) ? 1 : 0) for j in range(i))
memo = {}
def is_divisible(sub, k):
    return all(x % k == 0 for x in sub)
dp[0] = 1
for i in range(1, n+1):
    dp[i] = sum(dp[j] * (is_divisible(a[j:i+1], j) ? 1 : 0) for j in range(i))
print((dp[n]) % (10**9 + 7))
