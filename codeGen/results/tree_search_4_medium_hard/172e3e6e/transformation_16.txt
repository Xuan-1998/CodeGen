The problem involves finding the number of good subsequences, which seems to be a function of the current element and the previous subsequence lengths. This suggests that memoization could be effective.

State: dp[i] = whether subsequence ending at index i can be extended to include a[i]. Base case: If i <= 1, then this state is True because there are no subsequences that can't be extended.
State: dp[i] = whether subsequence ending at index i can be extended to include a[i]. Transition relationship: dp[i] = (dp[i-1] and a[i]%len(dp[i-1]) == 0) or (i > 0 and a[i]%i == 0).

Memoize the problem using recursion with memorization.
