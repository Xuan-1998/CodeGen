===BEGIN PLAN===
State: (i, divisors), where i is the current index and divisors are the list of divisors of all previous elements up to the current element.
The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming with memoization. The state can be initialized as (0, [1]) because there is only one divisor for 1.
For each number in the array, iterate over the possible divisors and update the state accordingly. 
To check if a subsequence is good, it needs to satisfy two conditions: 
    1. It's not empty
    2. Every element in the subsequence is divisible by its index
The DP state should store whether the number of good subsequences ending at each position is odd or even.
Calculate and update the state based on the previous states. Finally, return the final state as the result.
