===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves finding the number of good subsequences, which seems to be a function of the current element and the previous subsequence lengths. This suggests that memoization could be effective.

State: The number of good subsequences ending at index i with the last element being a[i]. Base case: If a[i] is not divisible by i, then there are no good subsequences.

State: dp[i][j] represents the number of good subsequences ending at index i with length j. Transition: if a[i] is divisible by i, then we can extend any existing subsequence to be one longer. Since this problem involves divisibility, we need to consider all possible lengths up to i for which a[i] is divisible.

State: Use a dictionary dp to store the memoized values and update them as needed

Transition:
    if a[i] % i == 0:
        for j in range(1, i+1):
            if i % j == 0:
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1].get(j, 0) + dp[i-1].get(j//i, 0)) % (10**9 + 7)
    else:
        dp[i][0] = 1

State: The final result is the sum of all values in dp[n][j] for j ranging from 1 to n. This ensures that we consider all possible subsequences.

State: The final result should be taken modulo 10^9 + 7 to avoid overflow.
