===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves finding the number of good subsequences, which seems to be a function of the current element and the previous subsequence lengths. This suggests that memoization could be effective.

State: Let dp[i][k] represent the number of good subsequences ending at index i with the last element being k.
Base case: If a[i] is not divisible by i, then there are no good subsequences.
Transition: for each possible last element value k from 1 to min(a[i], i), check if a[i] is divisible by k. 
Update dp[i][k] accordingly:
    - If k == 1, set dp[i][k] = dp[i-1][1] + 1
    - Else, set dp[i][k] = dp[i-1][k] + (a[i] % k != 0) * dp[i-1][k//k]
State: The number of good subsequences ending at index i is the sum of dp[i][k] for all possible last element values k.

Use a 2D array dp, where dp[i][k] represents the number of good subsequences ending at index i with the last element being k.
Edge cases:
    - If i == 0, return 1 (empty subsequence is considered as good)
    - If a[i] is not divisible by i, there are no good subsequences
