===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem involves checking divisibility, it might be more efficient to use dynamic programming with memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.

Consider the state as a tuple (i, last_divisor), where i is the length of the subsequence and last_divisor is the largest divisor of the last element in the subsequence. State (i, last_divisor) represents whether the last i elements in array a are divisible by last_divisor.

To use memoization to store the results of subproblems based on the state i and last_divisor:

* Initialize a 2D array dp with size n+1 x max(a_i)+1 where dp[i][d] is True if the first i elements in array a are divisible by d, otherwise False.
* For each i from 0 to n:
	+ For each d from 1 to max(a_i):
		- If i == 0 or (i > 0 and a[i-1] % d == 0), then dp[i][d] = True if dp[i-1][d] is True, otherwise False.
* The answer is the sum of dp[i][max(a_i)] for all i from 0 to n modulo 10^9 + 7.

This plan should correctly solve the problem. It uses dynamic programming with memoization to avoid redundant calculations and efficiently check divisibility. It also handles edge cases by initializing the state correctly.
