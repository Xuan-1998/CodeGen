===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by considering all possible lengths of subsequences and using dynamic programming to count the number of good subsequences for each length.

Let dp[i] = the number of good subsequences of length i, and the base case is dp[0] = 1.
dp[i] = sum(dp[j] * (is_divisible(a[i:j+1], j) ? 1 : 0) for j in range(i))
    where is_divisible(sub, k) returns 1 if all elements of sub are divisible by k, and 0 otherwise

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with a table dp where dp[i] represents the number of good subsequences of length i.

For edge cases, handle the base case where i = 0 separately: dp[0] = 1
