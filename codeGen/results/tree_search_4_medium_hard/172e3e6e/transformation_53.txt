===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the state as a dictionary (i, prefix_sum) where i is the current element's index and prefix_sum is the sum of all numbers in the array up to this point.

State: dp[i][j] where:
    - i is the current index
    - j is the current number being considered
    dp[i][j] = 1 if the subsequence ending at this position has been checked before (i.e., it's a good subsequence)
         = 0 otherwise

Initial state: dp[0][0] = 1 (base case: an empty array is always a good subsequence)

Transition rule:
    If the current number j is divisible by i, then
        dp[i-1][j//i] represents the number of good subsequences ending at this position without considering the current number
        dp[i-1][j//i] + 1 represents the number of good subsequences including the current number
    Otherwise,
        dp[i-1][j] is the same as the previous state (no new information)

Final state: dp[n-1][total_sum] where n is the length of the array and total_sum is the sum of all numbers in the array

To calculate the answer, iterate over the table and count the number of good subsequences.
