===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem involves checking divisibility, it might be more efficient to use tabulation to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.
Consider the state as a tuple (i, last_divisor), where i is the length of the subsequence and last_divisor is the largest divisor of the last element in the subsequence.
State: (i, last_divisor) represents whether the last i elements in a are divisible by last_divisor.

Let's initialize the table with base cases:
- For (0, last_divisor), if last_divisor == 1, then it's always true that the last 0 elements in the subsequence are divisible by last_divisor. Otherwise, it's always false.
- For (i, 1), it's always true that the last i elements in a are divisible by 1.

Then, we can iterate over each possible length of the subsequence (up to n) and for each length, iterate over each possible largest divisor (from 2 up to max element in a). If the current length is divisible by the current largest divisor, then update the table with the result of checking whether the last i elements are divisible by this largest divisor.

Finally, we can return the total count of states where last_divisor > 1, as these represent good subsequences.
