===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem involves checking divisibility, it might be more efficient to use tabulation to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.

We can define the state as (prefix, length), where prefix is the longest prefix of the current subsequence that has all its elements divisible by their indices, and length is the length of this prefix. The state could also be a pair (dp_index, dp_value), where dp_index represents the last element considered in the dynamic programming table, and dp_value is the value computed for this subproblem.

To implement memoization using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems, we can use the following approach:
- Initialize an empty dictionary dp.
- Define a function compute_good_subsequences(a, n) that takes an array a and its length n as input. This function will recursively calculate the number of good subsequences for each prefix of a.
- Inside this function, iterate through the array from left to right, considering each element i as a potential last element of the subsequence.
- For each i, check if the current subsequence ending at i is good by checking that every element in the subsequence up to i is divisible by its index. If it is good, update dp accordingly.
- Finally, return the sum of all values stored in dp modulo 10^9 + 7.

This plan includes edge cases as well. For instance, when considering each i, we should check if the current subsequence ending at i is good and update dp accordingly. This ensures that we handle edge cases correctly.
