===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by considering all possible lengths of subsequences and using dynamic programming to count the number of good subsequences for each length.

The state expression is dp[j] = the number of good subsequences of length j, and the base case is dp[0] = 1.

dp[i] = sum(dp[k]*binomial(n-1,k) for k in range(i+1)) if i != 0 else 1
Apply both bottom-up tabulation and memoization techniques to fill up dp in a single pass

The final answer will be the value of dp[n]
