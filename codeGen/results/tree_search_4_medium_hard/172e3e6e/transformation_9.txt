===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves finding the number of good subsequences, which seems to be a function of the current element and the previous subsequence lengths. This suggests that memoization could be effective.

Let's define the state as (i, pre) where i is the current element and pre is the previous subsequence length. This allows us to consider sequences with different lengths.

The base case handles when i is 1, meaning we're considering sequences of length 0. In this case, there's only one possible sequence, which is an empty sequence.

We can define a recursive function with memoization that calculates the count of good subsequences that can be extended by appending a[i], given that it's divisible by i.

Define each key-value pair as (i, pre) and use a dictionary to store previously computed values. This will help us avoid redundant computations.

To improve the plan, we can add edge cases for when i is greater than 1. In this case, we'll need to consider sequences with different lengths and find the number of good subsequences that can be extended by appending a[i].

The updated plan looks like this:
