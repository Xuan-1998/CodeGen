===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves finding the number of good subsequences, which seems to be a function of the current element and the previous subsequence lengths. This suggests that memoization could be effective.

State: dp[i][j] = whether subsequence of length j ending at index i can be extended to include a[i]. Base case: If i == 0, then this state is False because there are no subsequences. If i > 1, then this state is the same as the previous one because there are no subsequences that can be extended.

Transition relationship: dp[i][j] = (i > 0 and a[i]%j == 0) or (dp[i-1][j-1] and a[i]%j == 0).

Tabulate the dynamic programming table using a 2D array where each cell represents whether the subsequence ending at index i can be extended to include a[i].

Count the number of good subsequences by summing up dp[n][i] for all i (1 ≤ i ≤ n). Take this count modulo 10^9 + 7 as the final answer.
