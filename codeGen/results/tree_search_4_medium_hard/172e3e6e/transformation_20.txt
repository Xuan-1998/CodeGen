===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves finding the number of good subsequences, which seems to be a function of the current element and the previous subsequence lengths. This suggests that memoization could be effective.

State: dp[i][j] = whether the subsequence of length j ending at index i can be extended to include a[i]. Base case: If i == 0, then there are no subsequences that can be extended. For non-zero base cases, we need to consider two scenarios:

- If i > 1 and a[i]%j == 0, then the subsequence of length j ending at index i can be extended.
- Otherwise (i.e., i > 1 and a[i]%j != 0 or i == 1), the subsequence cannot be extended.

Transition relationship: dp[i][j] = (a[i]%j == 0) if (i > 0) else dp[i-1][j]

Use memoization by storing intermediate results in a dictionary to avoid redundant computation. Initialize all dp values to False, then update them based on the transition relationship and previous values.
