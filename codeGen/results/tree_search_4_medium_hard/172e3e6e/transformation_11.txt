The problem involves finding the number of good subsequences, which seems to be a function of the current element and the previous subsequence lengths. This suggests that memoization could be effective.

Let dp[i][j] denote the count of good subsequences ending at index i with length j. The state expression defines the count of good subsequences that can be extended by appending a[i], given that it's divisible by i.

The base case handles when i is 1 and we only consider sequences with length 0, in which case dp[0][j] = 1 if j == 0, otherwise 0.

To calculate the new value for dp[i][j], iterate over all previous subsequence lengths k less than or equal to i. For each k, check if a[i] is divisible by k; if so, add the count of good subsequences ending at index i-1 with length j-k to the total count.

The final answer is the sum of dp[n][j] over all possible subsequence lengths j.
