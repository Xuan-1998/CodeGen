===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by considering all possible lengths of subsequences and using dynamic programming to count the number of good subsequences for each length.

Let's define dp[i] as the number of good subsequences of length i. The base case is dp[0] = 1, since there is exactly one way to have a subsequence of length 0 (the empty subsequence).

For larger values of i, we can use the following recurrence relation:

dp[i] = product((i | a[j]%i == 0) for j in range(i)) * dp[i-1]

This expression counts the number of indices j such that i divides a[j], and then multiplies this by the number of good subsequences of length i-1. This is because we can extend any good subsequence of length i-1 to a good subsequence of length i by adding an element at index j if i divides a[j].

To fill up the dp array from the base case, we start with dp[0] = 1 and then use the recurrence relation to compute the values of dp[i] for larger values of i.

Finally, our answer is simply dp[n], which is the number of good subsequences of length n.
