===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the state as a dictionary (i, divisors), where i is the current element's index and divisors are the list of divisors of the previous elements up to the current element.

State: dp[i] = (i, divisors) where i is the current index and divisors are the divisors of previous elements.

Create a memoization function that uses recursion to calculate the dynamic programming states and values. 

For each state (i, divisors), if there's no good subsequence ending at the current element i, return 0.
Else, for each divisor d in divisors:
    If the current element is divisible by d, then add dp[i-1][d] to the count of good subsequences.
    Otherwise, skip this divisor.

Return the total count of good subsequences modulo 10^9 + 7.
