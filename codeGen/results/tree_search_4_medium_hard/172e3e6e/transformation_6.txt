===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves finding the number of good subsequences, which seems to be a function of the current element and the previous subsequence lengths. This suggests that memoization could be effective.

State: The number of good subsequences ending at index i with the last element being a[i]. Base case: If a[i] is not divisible by i, then there are no good subsequences.

State: dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to extend a subsequence of length j to be one longer at index i. Transition: if a[i] is divisible by i, then we can extend the subsequence if its last element is also divisible by i.

Memoize using dp[i][j] as the state variable and implement it with a recursive function that uses memoization to store intermediate results.

Transition: for each i, calculate the number of good subsequences ending at index i. For j from 1 to n, check if a[i] is divisible by j. If yes, then add the number of good subsequences of length j-1 to dp[i][j]. This will give us the total number of good subsequences ending at index i.

Edge cases: handle the case where i or j is equal to 0. In this case, there are no good subsequences.
