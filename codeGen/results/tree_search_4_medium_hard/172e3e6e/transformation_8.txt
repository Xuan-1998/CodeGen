===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem involves finding the number of good subsequences, which seems to be a function of the current element and the previous subsequence lengths. This suggests that memoization could be effective.

Let dp[i][pre] represent the count of good subsequences that can be extended by appending a[i], given that the previous subsequence length is pre.

The state transition is as follows:
- If i is 1, there's only one possible extension: an empty sequence. So, dp[1][0] = 1.
- For all other values of i, consider two cases:
    - If a[i] is divisible by i, append it to the previous subsequence. There are dp[i-1][pre] such subsequences that can be extended.
    - If a[i] is not divisible by i, do not extend the previous subsequence. So, there's no new extension.

The base case handles when i is 1 and we only consider sequences with length 0.

Employ a 2D array-based tabulation approach to fill up dp[][] in a bottom-up manner, where:
- Initialize all values of dp[] as 0.
- Iterate over each element a[i] from right to left. For each i, iterate over all possible previous subsequence lengths pre from 1 to min(i, 6).
- Update dp[i][pre] based on the state transition.

Finally, return dp[n][0] as the answer.
