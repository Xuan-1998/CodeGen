===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state as a tuple (i, last_divisor), where i is the length of the subsequence and last_divisor is the largest divisor of the last element in the subsequence.

State: (i, last_divisor) is updated to (i-1, d) if the last element of the current subsequence is divisible by d.

Use a dictionary dp to store the results of subproblems and update it accordingly as you iterate through the array. Initialize dp with an empty map for each initial state.

For each number in the array:
	* If the number is divisible by its index, update the state (i, last_divisor) in dp.
	* Iterate over the previous states that have a last_divisor greater than or equal to i and increment their count by 1. This represents all good subsequences ending at this position.

Return dp[0][1] as the total number of good subsequences modulo 10^9 + 7.
