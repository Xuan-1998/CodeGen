===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem involves checking divisibility, it might be more efficient to use tabulation to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.

Define the state as a dictionary (i, divisors), where i is the current element's index and divisors are the list of divisors of the previous elements up to the current element.
State: dp[i] = { prev_divisors }, where i is the current index and prev_divisors are the divisors of previous elements.

Initialize a dictionary dp with n+1 keys, all set to an empty dictionary. This will store the dynamic programming states and values.

For each index i from 0 to n-1:

* Calculate the current element's divisors (divisors).
* If i == 0, set dp[i][divisors] = 1.
* Else, calculate the number of good subsequences ending at i using the information stored in dp[i-1].
* Store the result in dp[i][divisors].

Finally, sum up all values in dp[n-1] and return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
