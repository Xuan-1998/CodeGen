===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state as a tuple (i, last_divisor), where i is the length of the subsequence and last_divisor is the largest divisor of the last element in the subsequence.

State: (i, last_divisor) is updated to (i-1, d) if the last element of the current subsequence is divisible by d.
Create a dictionary memo = {(0, 0): 1} as the base case for the empty subsequence.
Iterate through the array from right to left. For each element, check all possible divisors up to its value and update the state accordingly.

State: (i, last_divisor) is updated to (i-1, d) if the last element of the current subsequence is divisible by d.
Use memo.get() or memo.setdefault() to store the results of each subproblem into the dictionary. 
The final answer is stored in memo[(n, 0)] where n is the length of the array.
