===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider the state as a tuple (i, j), where i is the length of the subsequence and j is the largest divisor of the last element in the subsequence.

State: dp[i][j] = 1 if there exists a good subsequence ending at index i with the largest divisor j; otherwise, it's 0. 

dp[i][j] = (a[i-1] % j == 0) && 
          (i > 1 ? dp[i-1][j] : 1)

The base case is when the length of the subsequence is 1. In this case, there is only one way to form a good subsequence, which is to include the single element.

The transition state is when we extend the current subsequence by adding the current element. We need to check if the current element is divisible by j and update dp[i][j] accordingly.

We can use memoization to store the results of checking divisibility for each number and avoid redundant calculations.
