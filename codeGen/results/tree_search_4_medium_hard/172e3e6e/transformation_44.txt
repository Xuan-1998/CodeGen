===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can maintain two arrays dp1 and dp2 where dp1[i][j] represents the number of good subsequences ending at index j with prefix sum i, and dp2[i][j] represents the count of indices in that subsequence which are divisible by their position.
The base case would be when the current element is not divisible by its position, so we can't form a good subsequence. We would initialize dp1[0][i] and dp2[0][i] for all i to 0.
To fill up dp1[i][j] and dp2[i][j], we consider two cases: either the current element is not included in the subsequence, or it is included.
If the current element is not included, then the number of good subsequences remains the same as that ending at index j-1. The count also remains the same as there are no new indices divisible by their position.
If the current element is included and is divisible by its position, we add 1 to the count and update dp1[i][j] accordingly.
We would then calculate the number of good subsequences for each possible prefix sum and length. This will be the sum of all values in dp2 where the prefix sum modulo 10^9 + 7 is less than or equal to i, times (i + 1).
Finally, we would return the sum modulo 10^9 + 7.
