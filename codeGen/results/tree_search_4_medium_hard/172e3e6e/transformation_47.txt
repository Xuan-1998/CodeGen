===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem involves checking divisibility, it might be more efficient to use tabulation to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.

Consider the state as a tuple (dp[i], bad_count), where dp[i] is the number of good subsequences ending at index i, and bad_count is the count of elements in the subsequence not divisible by their indices.

Use dynamic programming to fill up a 2D table dp[][], where dp[i][j] represents the number of good subsequences ending at index i with length j. For each element a[i], update dp[i][j] based on the previous state (dp[i-1][j-1], bad_count) and the divisibility condition.

To handle edge cases, consider initializing the first row or column of the table accordingly.
