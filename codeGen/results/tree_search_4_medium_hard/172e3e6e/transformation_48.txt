===BEGIN PLAN===
Since the problem involves checking divisibility, it might be more efficient to use tabulation to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.
Let's define the state as a tuple (good_prefix, bad_count), where good_prefix is the longest prefix of the current subsequence that has all its elements divisible by their indices, and bad_count is the number of elements in this prefix that are not divisible by their indices.

We can construct a dynamic programming table using nested loops, where each cell in the table corresponds to a state (prefix, length) and stores the result of that state. The base case would be when the length of the subsequence is 0 or less, in which case there's only one possible good subsequence - an empty one.

The transition function can be defined as follows:
- If the current element is divisible by its index, then we consider two cases: either the previous good prefix ends at this element (good_prefix + 1), or it doesn't (bad_count + 1).
- If the current element is not divisible by its index, then we simply increment bad_count.
We can use these transitions to fill up the dynamic programming table.

The final answer would be the sum of all good subsequence counts modulo 10^9 + 7.
