===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by considering all possible lengths of subsequences and using dynamic programming to count the number of good subsequences for each length.

state_expression = dp[j] = the number of good subsequences of length j,

base_case = dp[0] = 1, because there is one empty subsequence that meets the condition (it's an empty subsequence).

dp[i] = 
    if i == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        sum(dp[j] * (is_divisible(a[j:i+1], j) ? 1 : 0) for j in range(i))
    where is_divisible(sub, k) returns 1 if all elements of sub are divisible by k, and 0 otherwise

Memoization Dictionary to store the dynamic programming state.

This plan seems correct. It's a good start.
To improve it:
- Make sure that we handle edge cases properly. For instance, what if i is less than 0? What should dp[i] be in this case?
- Use memoization dictionary to store the dynamic programming state. This can help avoid repeated computation and speed up the program.

This plan includes edge cases. It handles the base case of an empty subsequence correctly.
