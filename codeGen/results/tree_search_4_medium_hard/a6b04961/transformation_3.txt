===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that share common information, making it suitable for a dynamic programming approach with top-down memoization. This allows you to avoid redundant computation and efficiently store intermediate results.

The state expression could be (i, prev_vertex), where i is the length of the current tail and prev_vertex is the last vertex in the tail. For each possible edge, we can either add it to the tail or not. If we don't add it, the maximum beauty remains the same as for the previous tail of length i-1. If we do add it, the new maximum beauty would be the sum of the length of the current tail and the number of spines that can be formed.

We create a dictionary memo to store the maximum beauty for each possible tail length and previous vertex. The keys are (i, prev_vertex) and the values are the corresponding maximum beauty.

For each edge, we update the memo accordingly. We also maintain the maximum beauty found so far.

The final answer is the maximum value in the memo.
