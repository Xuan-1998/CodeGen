===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming with memoization in a top-down approach. This might involve treating certain subproblems as identical or equivalent, allowing you to reduce the time complexity of your algorithm.

State: Consider using a tuple (last_node_in_tail, spine_count) as the state expression, where last_node_in_tail is the most recent node added to the tail and spine_count is the number of spines counted so far. The base case would be when there are no more nodes that can be connected to the tail.

State: Use a dynamic programming table with a tuple (last_node_in_tail, spine_count) as the key and the maximum beauty as the value.

Consider using a graph coloring approach where each node has a color indicating whether it belongs to the hedgehog's tail or not. This could help in reducing the number of subproblems and thus improve the efficiency of the algorithm.

State: Initialize the dynamic programming table with zeros for all possible states (last_node_in_tail, spine_count).

State: Iterate over the edges in the graph and consider each edge as a potential addition to the hedgehog's tail. For each edge, update the dynamic programming table by considering all previous states that are compatible with the current edge.

State: The maximum beauty is the maximum value stored in the dynamic programming table after iterating over all edges.
