===BEGIN PLAN===
Define a state as the pair (t, s), where t is the length of the current tail and s is the number of spines formed so far. The base case would be when all vertices have been included in the tail or spines, i.e., t = n or s = m.

Let's consider the transition between states (t, s) and (t', s'). If we add an edge to form a new spine, then s' will be equal to s + 1. The length of the tail remains unchanged, so t' will be equal to t. If we add an edge to extend the tail, then t' will be equal to t + 1 and s' will remain unchanged.

Memoize the dynamic programming state (t, s) using a dictionary with (t, s) as keys and the maximum beauty as values. The transition can be written as follows:

dp[(t', s')] = max(dp[(t, s)] * (s + 1), dp[(t - 1, s)])

This plan is correct, but it's missing one important detail: the initialization of the dynamic programming array.

To initialize the dp array, we need to consider all possible states where t = 0 or s = 0. Since there can't be a tail with length 0 or no spines at all, these base cases will have beauty 0.

The plan is complete when initialized correctly:

dp[(t, s)] = max(dp[(t - 1, s)], dp[(t, s - 1)]) * (s + 1) if t > 0 and s > 0
dp[(0, s)] = 0 for all s
dp[(t, 0)] = t for all t

The maximum beauty is the value of dp[(n, m)].
