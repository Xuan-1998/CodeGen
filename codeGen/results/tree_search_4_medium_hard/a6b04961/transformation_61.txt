===BEGIN PLAN===
State: Define a state as a tuple (tail_length, spines_count), where tail_length is the number of vertices in the current path and spines_count is the number of edges that have one endpoint in this path. The base case would be when there are no more edges to consider.
Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum beauty achievable with i edges and j spines.
Initialization: Initialize dp[0][0] = 1, because a hedgehog with 0 edges and 0 spines has a beauty of 1 (by default).
Transition relationships:
    - If the current edge is part of the tail, then it contributes to the length of the tail. So, update dp[i+1][j] = dp[i][0] + j.
    - If the current edge is not part of the tail, but one endpoint is in the tail and the other is not, then it's a spine. So, update dp[i][j+1] = max(dp[i-1][k] for k from 0 to j) + (i * (j+1)).
    - If neither of the above conditions hold, then the edge is not part of the hedgehog and we should consider the same number of edges without this edge. So, update dp[i-1][j].
dp[n][m] will store the maximum beauty achievable with n edges and m spines.
