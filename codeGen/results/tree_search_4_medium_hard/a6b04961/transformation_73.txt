===BEGIN PLAN===
Use dynamic programming with memoization in a top-down approach.

State: (tail_length, number_of_spines), where tail_length is the length of the current hedgehog's tail and number_of_spines is the count of spines found so far. The base case would be when the tail reaches its maximum allowed length.

Memoization dictionary: Store previously computed values for subproblems with the same state to avoid redundant computations.

Function dp(tail_length, number_of_spines): Calculate the maximum beauty that can be achieved by extending the current hedgehog's tail of length tail_length and having number_of_spines spines so far.

Base case 1: If the tail reaches its maximum allowed length (n), return the product of the tail length and the number of spines.
Base case 2: If there are no more edges to consider, return the current beauty.

Recursive step:
For each edge (u, v):
    If u is in the current hedgehog's tail, add the edge to the tail if v is not in it. Update the state and store the result in the memoization dictionary.
    Calculate the maximum beauty that can be achieved by extending the current hedgehog's tail of length tail_length + 1 and having number_of_spines + 1 spines so far.
