===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, meaning the solution to a larger instance can be constructed from solutions of smaller instances, making it amenable to bottom-up tabulation.

The base case is when there are no more edges to consider, i.e., when all vertices have been included in the tail or spines. In this case, the beauty is simply the number of spines, which can be calculated by counting the number of edges that do not belong to the tail.

The state could be a tuple containing the length of the current path (tail) and the number of edges not yet used to extend it. This means you would need a 3D array to store the maximum beauty for each possible tail length, with rows representing the tail length, columns representing the edge index, and pages representing the remaining edges.

Use dynamic programming to fill up the 3D array in a bottom-up manner. For each cell, consider all possible extensions of the current path: either add an edge to extend the tail or add an edge as a spine. Calculate the maximum beauty for each extension and store it in the corresponding cell.
