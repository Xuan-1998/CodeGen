===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that share common information, making it suitable for a dynamic programming approach with top-down memoization. This allows you to avoid redundant computation and efficiently store intermediate results.

The state expression could be the maximum beauty of a hedgehog that can be achieved by considering all possible tails up to i vertices long, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

Consider the current maximum beauty as the maximum of the previous maximum beauty and the beauty achieved by extending the current tail with a new vertex. This means you need to consider two cases: either the new vertex is added to the end of the current tail or it starts a new spine.

Use a loop to fill in the dynamic programming table from left to right, starting with the base case (tail of length 1) and recursively calculating the values for longer tails. When filling the table, consider all possible edges that can be used to extend the current tail.

To improve the plan, you could use a priority queue to efficiently select the edge that results in the maximum beauty when added to the current tail.

Potential issues with the plan include: 
- What if there are multiple valid extensions for the current tail? You would need to consider all of them and take the one that leads to the maximum beauty.
- How do you handle edges that connect two vertices that are already part of a spine? Do you count it as a new spine or not?
- Edge cases: what happens if there is only one edge in the graph? What if the graph is empty?
