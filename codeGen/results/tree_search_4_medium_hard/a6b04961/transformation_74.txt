===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming with memoization:

State: Define a state tuple (tail_length, visited) where tail_length is the length of the current hedgehog's tail and visited is a set containing all vertices that are part of the current hedgehog's tail. This allows for efficient checking of whether an edge connects two vertices already in the tail.

Memoization: Use a nested dictionary memo to store the results of subproblems. The key would be the state tuple (tail_length, visited) and the value would be the maximum possible beauty of the hedgehog.

Base Case: When the tail reaches its maximum allowed length (n), return 0 as there are no more edges that can contribute to the beauty.

Top-Down Approach:

1. Initialize memo with default values.
2. For each edge i:
    - If the edge connects two vertices already in the tail, skip it and move on to the next edge.
    - Otherwise, for each possible length of the tail (up to n):
        - Calculate the beauty if this edge is part of the tail: (tail_length + 1) * (number_of_spines + 1)
        - Update memo with the maximum of the current value and the calculated beauty.

3. Return the maximum value in memo when the tail reaches its maximum allowed length (n).

This approach should work as it considers all possible combinations of edges that can form a hedgehog, and chooses the combination that results in the highest beauty.
