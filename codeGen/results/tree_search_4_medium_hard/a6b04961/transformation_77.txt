===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming with memoization in a top-down approach:
State: Use a tuple (tail_length, number_of_spines) as the state expression, where tail_length is the length of the current hedgehog's tail and number_of_spines is the count of spines found so far. The base case would be when the tail reaches its maximum allowed length.
Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum possible beauty for a tail length i and j number of spines.
For each vertex v, treat it as a potential starting point for the current hedgehog's tail. Then, use dynamic programming to find the maximum possible beauty from there by considering all edges connected to v.
If an edge (u, v) is not colored yet, consider two cases: coloring this edge or not coloring this edge. 
- If we color this edge:
    - Update dp[tail_length][number_of_spines] for each spine found
    - Recursively explore the subproblem with updated tail length and number of spines
- If we don't color this edge:
    - Do nothing, just move to the next vertex
Update the maximum possible beauty by considering all edges connected to v.
The final answer would be the maximum value in dp[n][*] for a given n.
