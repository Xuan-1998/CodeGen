===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that share common information, making it suitable for a dynamic programming approach with top-down memoization. This allows you to avoid redundant computation and efficiently store intermediate results.

State: Define the state as the maximum beauty achievable given a certain tail. The tail is represented by its last vertex, and all edges connected to it are stored in a set or list.
Transition: When adding an edge to the tail, update the state based on whether it results in a longer tail or not. This can be done by checking if the new edge connects to any of the existing vertices in the tail.

To improve the plan:

* Use a dictionary to store the maximum beauty achievable for each vertex as the last vertex in the tail. This allows you to avoid redundant computation and efficiently look up the state.
* For each edge, check if it can be part of the tail by seeing if it connects to any of the existing vertices in the tail. If it does, update the state accordingly.

Potential issues with the plan:

* The plan assumes that the graph is connected, but this is not explicitly stated in the problem. However, since the problem allows for a spine to have one endpoint not in the tail, it is likely that the graph is assumed to be connected.
* The plan does not account for edge cases where there are no edges left to add to the tail. This can be handled by returning 0 or some other default value when there are no more edges.

Edge cases:

* If there are no edges in the graph, return 0.
* If there is only one vertex in the graph, return 1 (since it cannot have any spines).
