===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that share common information, making it suitable for a dynamic programming approach with top-down memoization. This allows you to avoid redundant computation and efficiently store intermediate results.

Define the state as the maximum beauty that can be achieved by considering only tails up to i vertices long, with no constraints on the number of spines. This state is calculated based on the states of shorter tails and the edges available at vertex i.

Store the dynamic programming table using a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of maximum beauties for each possible spine count. The list will have length equal to the number of vertices in the graph, and the index will represent the beauty achievable by considering only tails up to that many vertices long.

The base case is when i is 1, in which case the maximum beauty achievable is the sum of the degrees of all vertices except for the one at position i. This is because there can be no spines for a tail with only one vertex.

For larger values of i, the state can be calculated as the maximum of two options: either extend the current tail by one vertex and add a spine to it if possible, or start a new tail from vertex i and consider the beauty achievable by considering tails up to i - 1 vertices long.

The problem can then be solved by returning the last element in the dynamic programming table, which represents the maximum beauty that can be achieved by considering all vertices in the graph.
