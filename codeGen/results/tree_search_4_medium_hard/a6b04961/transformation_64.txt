===BEGIN PLAN===
Define a state as a tuple (path_length, used_edges), where path_length is the length of the current tail and used_edges is a set of edges already used for forming the current hedgehog.

State could be defined as (path_length, used_edges) where path_length is the length of the current tail and used_edges is a set of edges already used for forming the current hedgehog. Transition relationships would involve checking if an edge can be safely added to the path without creating a cycle or using an edge more than once.

Use dynamic programming with memoization to store the results of subproblems in a 2D table, where the rows represent different states and the columns represent different edges. The beauty of a hedgehog is the product of its length and number of spines. 

State: For each state (path_length, used_edges), calculate the maximum possible beauty for that state.
Transition relationship: 
- If an edge can be safely added to the path without creating a cycle or using an edge more than once, add it to the used edges and increment the path length.
- Calculate the new beauty by multiplying the path length by the number of spines.

Memoization: Store the results in a 2D table (dp) where dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible beauty for a state with i edges and j path length.
Base case: 
- When there are no more edges to consider, return 0 as the maximum possible beauty.
