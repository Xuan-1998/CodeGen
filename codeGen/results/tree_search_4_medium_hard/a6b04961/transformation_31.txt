===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, making it amenable to bottom-up tabulation.

Consider a state representing the maximum beauty that can be achieved by the hedgehog with its tail ending at vertex i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

Transition relationship: 
dp[i] = max(dp[j] * (i - j + 1) for j in range(min(j, i)) if there is an edge from j to i)

Base case:
dp[0] = 0

Recursive relation:
dp[i] = max(dp[j] * (i - j + 1), dp[k] * 1 for k in range(i))

Initialize the dynamic programming table with base cases.
Iterate through vertices and update the maximum beauty achievable.
