===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that share common information, making it suitable for a dynamic programming approach with top-down memoization. This allows you to avoid redundant computation and efficiently store intermediate results.

State: Define the number of spines formed for each possible tail length; Transition: Update the state by considering all edges that can be added to the current tail length and incrementing the spine count accordingly.

Define a recursive function that keeps track of the last vertex in the tail and all edges connected to it, then use memoization to avoid redundant computation. The base case is when the tail reaches its maximum possible length (n-1), at which point the beauty is calculated as the product of the tail length and the number of spines.

To further optimize the plan, consider using a priority queue to always prioritize edges that can extend the current tail length by the most, reducing the number of recursive calls. This can be achieved by maintaining a priority queue of edges with one endpoint in the current tail and sorting them based on their distance from the last vertex in the tail.

Additionally, consider implementing edge cases for when the graph has no edges or only one edge, to handle these special cases correctly.
