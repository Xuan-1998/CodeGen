===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that share common information, making it suitable for a dynamic programming approach with top-down memoization. This allows you to avoid redundant computation and efficiently store intermediate results.

A suitable state could be defined as the maximum beauty that can be achieved by considering only tails up to i vertices long, where we have either seen all vertices or not.

The state could be represented as (j, k), where j is the current length of the tail, and k is a boolean indicating whether we've seen all vertices or not. The transition relationship would decide whether to extend the tail, add a spine, or stop at each step.

You can use a 3D array dp where dp[i][j][k] stores the maximum beauty for tails of length j, considering whether we've seen all vertices k. This allows you to store information about the current vertex and its position in the graph.

The base case would be when i is equal to n (the number of vertices), at which point the function should return 0, since there are no more vertices to consider.

For each step, you could check if adding an edge to the tail increases the beauty. If not, you can skip it and move on to the next vertex.

The transition relationship would look something like this:

* If k is true (we've seen all vertices), we can only add spines or stop.
* If k is false (we haven't seen all vertices), we can extend the tail or add a spine, depending on whether adding an edge to the tail increases the beauty.

The final answer would be the maximum value stored in dp[n][j][k] for any j and k.
