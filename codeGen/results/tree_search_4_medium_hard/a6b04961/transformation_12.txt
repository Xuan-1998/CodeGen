===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that share common information, making it suitable for a dynamic programming approach with top-down memoization. This allows you to avoid redundant computation and efficiently store intermediate results.

State: Define the number of spines that can be formed given a certain tail, which would involve keeping track of the last vertex in the tail and all edges connected to it.
Transition: Update the state by considering all edges that can be added to the current tail length and incrementing the spine count accordingly. 

Use a 2D table where the first dimension is the number of vertices in the tail, and the second dimension is the maximum possible beauty given the number of spines.

1. Initialize the table with zeros.
2. Iterate over all edges:
    For each edge, check if adding this edge to the current tail length increases the spine count and the beauty. If yes, update the corresponding cell in the 2D table.
3. Find the maximum value in the last row of the table (corresponding to the longest possible tail), which represents the maximum possible beauty.
