===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, making it amenable to bottom-up tabulation. Define a state as the tuple (t, p), where t is the length of the current tail and p is the number of vertices not yet included in the tail.

Base case: When all vertices have been included in the tail or spines, i.e., t = n. Initialize memoization with base cases.

Transition:
1. If p > 0, consider adding the next vertex to the tail. Calculate the beauty if this is done and update the memoization.
2. If p == 0, there are no more vertices to include in the tail or spines. The current beauty is the maximum achievable.
3. Memoize the dynamic programming state (t, p) using a dictionary with (t, p) as keys and the maximum beauty as values.

Memoized states should be calculated iteratively from smaller instances to larger ones. Start with base cases and incrementally build up the solution for larger instances.
