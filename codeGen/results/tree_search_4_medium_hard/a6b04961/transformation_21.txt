A third possibility could be defining the state as dp[i][k] = max beauty that can be achieved by considering only tails up to i vertices long with k vertices in the tail.

The state could be initialized as dp[0][0] = 0, and for each vertex i and length of tail k:

1. If there are no edges from any of the previous vertices ending at this one (i.e., all previous vertices have been visited), it's the start of a new spine.
2. If we've seen all vertices in the tail, then we can't extend the tail, so the maximum beauty is 0.
3. Otherwise, there are two choices: either add to the tail or stop at this vertex.

The transition relationship would be:

dp[i][k] = max(dp[i-1][k], dp[i-1][k-1] + (k+1))

This approach correctly handles edge cases and doesn't include unnecessary complexities.
