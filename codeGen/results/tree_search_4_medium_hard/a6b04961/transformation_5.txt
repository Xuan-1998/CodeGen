===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that share common information, making it suitable for a dynamic programming approach with top-down memoization. This allows you to avoid redundant computation and efficiently store intermediate results.

The state expression could be dp[i][v], where i is the length of the current tail and v is the last vertex in the tail. The value of dp[i][v] represents the maximum beauty that can be achieved by considering all possible tails up to i vertices long, with the last vertex being v.

To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can start from the smallest possible subproblems and gradually build up towards the original problem. This is a bottom-up approach.

Initialize a 2D array dp of size n+1 x n, where dp[i][v] will store the maximum beauty that can be achieved by considering all possible tails up to i vertices long, with the last vertex being v.

For every edge (u, v), for each u from 1 to n and each v from 1 to n:
    If there is no tail yet (i.e., i == 0), set dp[1][v] = 1. This means that a single edge with endpoint v can be considered as the starting point of a hedgehog.
    For every possible previous vertex prev_vertex from 1 to n:
        Calculate the maximum beauty that can be achieved by considering all possible tails up to i-1 vertices long, with the last vertex being prev_vertex. This is stored in dp[i-1][prev_vertex].
        If v is not in the current tail (i.e., prev_vertex != v), update dp[i][v] = max(dp[i][v], 1 + dp[i-1][prev_vertex]).
    Update dp[i][v] = max(dp[i][v], dp[i-1][v]).

Finally, return the maximum beauty that can be achieved by considering all possible tails up to n vertices long, with any possible last vertex. This is stored in dp[n][v].
