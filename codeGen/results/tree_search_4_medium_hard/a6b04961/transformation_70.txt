===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider treating each edge as a possible addition to the current hedgehog's tail. This could involve maintaining two variables: one for the current tail length, and another for the number of spines seen so far.
State: Use a tuple (tail_length, number_of_spines) as the state expression, where tail_length is the length of the current hedgehog's tail and number_of_spines is the count of spines found so far. The base case would be when the tail reaches its maximum allowed length.

For each edge (u, v), consider two possibilities:
- Add it to the current tail if u and v are in increasing order.
- Make it a spine by adding u to the tail and making all edges from u to other nodes spines.

Memoize the maximum beauty for each state. This could be done using a dictionary where the key is the current state (tail_length, number_of_spines) and the value is the maximum beauty achieved so far for that state.
For each edge:
- If adding it to the tail increases the beauty, update the memoization table.
- If making it a spine results in a higher beauty, update the memoization table.

The final answer would be the maximum beauty seen in the memoization table when the tail reaches its maximum allowed length.
