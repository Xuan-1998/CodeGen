===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic programming with memoization in a top-down approach is a good idea.

State: (nodes_in_tail, max_length) as the state expression, where nodes_in_tail is the set of vertices that form the current path of the hedgehog's tail and max_length is the maximum length of the tail seen so far. This will allow us to keep track of the different paths we can take and their corresponding lengths.

Base case: When the tail has reached its maximum length or when there are no more nodes that can be connected to the tail, we have a base case.

Use a nested dictionary to store the maximum beauty for each possible state (nodes_in_tail, max_length) as you build it up from scratch. This will allow us to avoid recomputing the same subproblems multiple times and thus reduce the time complexity of our algorithm.

Steps:
1. Initialize an empty dictionary dp.
2. Iterate over all nodes in the graph.
3. For each node, iterate over all its neighbors that are not yet in the tail.
4. For each neighbor, calculate the maximum beauty of a hedgehog ending at this neighbor and having length max_length + 1.
5. Update dp[nodes_in_tail][max_length] with the calculated maximum beauty if it is greater than the current value.

This plan seems correct, but we should also consider that nodes in the tail cannot be connected to other nodes not in the tail to form a hedgehog. Therefore, we need to keep track of whether each node is in the tail or not.
