===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a tuple (tail, last_node_in_tail) as the state expression, where tail is the current path of the hedgehog's tail and last_node_in_tail is the most recent node added to the tail. The base case would be when the tail has reached its maximum length or when there are no more nodes that can be connected to the tail.

The dynamic programming table dp[i][j] should store the maximum beauty for a hedgehog with i edges in the tail and j spines. Initialize all values of dp to 0. Then, iterate over the edges and for each edge (u, v), update the values of dp according to the following rules:

* If u is not in the tail, consider adding it as the next node in the tail. Calculate the maximum beauty for this new tail length and add the number of spines that would be created by connecting u to the end of the tail.
* If v is not in the tail, consider adding it as the next node in the tail. Calculate the maximum beauty for this new tail length and add the number of spines that would be created by connecting v to the end of the tail.

The maximum beauty across all possible tails with i edges should be stored at dp[i][*]. The final answer is the maximum value in the last column (i.e., dp[n][*]).
