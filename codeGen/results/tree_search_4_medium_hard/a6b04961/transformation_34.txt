===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, meaning the solution to a larger instance can be constructed from solutions of smaller instances, making it amenable to bottom-up tabulation.

Start by solving the base case: when there are no more edges to consider, i.e., when all vertices have been included in the tail or spines. In this case, the beauty is simply the number of spines, which can be calculated by counting the number of edges that do not belong to the tail.

The state could represent a subset of vertices that have been included in the tail, along with the number of spines and the maximum possible beauty considering only these vertices. This allows for memoization: store subproblem results in a dictionary so that the function does not have to recalculate them.

To build up the solution, start with an empty set of vertices in the tail (state 0) and calculate the beauty recursively:

1. For each edge, consider adding it to the tail or keeping it as a spine.
2. Calculate the beauty for the new state (set of vertices in the tail plus this edge).
3. Compare the beauty for this new state with the best possible beauty so far (memoized result).
4. If the new state has better beauty, update the memoization dictionary and store the new state.

This approach should correctly find the maximum possible value of the hedgehog's beauty.
