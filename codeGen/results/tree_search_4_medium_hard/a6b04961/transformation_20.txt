===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that share common information, making it suitable for a dynamic programming approach with top-down memoization.

A state could be defined as the maximum beauty that can be achieved by considering only tails up to i vertices long. This state would include the current length of the tail and whether we've seen all vertices or not.

The transition relationship would decide whether to extend the tail, add a spine, or stop at each step. The decision depends on the current tail's end vertex, its neighbors, and the remaining unvisited vertices.

A dynamic programming array dp could be used where dp[i] is the maximum beauty for tails up to i vertices long.

At each step, we consider the following options:
- Extend the current tail by one more vertex. If this extension is possible (i.e., the next vertex has an uncolored edge with a vertex in the current tail), calculate the new beauty.
- Add a spine to the current tail. If this is possible (i.e., there's an uncolored edge from the end of the current tail to an unvisited vertex), calculate the new beauty.
- Stop extending the current tail and start a new one.

The maximum beauty would be the maximum of these three options, considering only the vertices that are part of the current tail.
