===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming with memoization in a top-down approach. This might involve treating certain subproblems as identical or equivalent, allowing you to reduce the time complexity of your algorithm.

State: Consider using a tuple (nodes_in_tail, max_length) as the state expression, where nodes_in_tail is the set of vertices that form the current path of the hedgehog's tail and max_length is the maximum length of the tail seen so far. This allows us to capture the information needed to compute the beauty without storing the entire graph.

Store the dynamic programming table using a dictionary where the key is the state and the value is the computed beauty. This way, you can quickly look up previously computed states.

State transition: When considering whether to add a new node to the tail or not, consider using the following rules:
    - If the new node is already in the tail, it does not increase the beauty.
    - If the new node is not in the tail and there are no more nodes that can be connected to the current tail, the maximum length of the tail seen so far remains the same. This means we do not need to recalculate the beauty for this state.
    - Otherwise, consider adding the new node to the tail.

Base case: The base case is when the tail has reached its maximum length or when there are no more nodes that can be connected to the tail. In this case, the beauty remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
