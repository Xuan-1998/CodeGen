===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, meaning the solution to a larger instance can be constructed from solutions of smaller instances, making it amenable to bottom-up tabulation. You can start by solving the base case and then iteratively build up the solution for larger instances.

The base case is when there are no more edges to consider, i.e., when all vertices have been included in the tail or spines. In this case, the beauty is simply the number of spines, which can be calculated by counting the number of edges that do not belong to the tail.

The state could be a tuple (tail_length, edge_index) representing the length of the current path (tail) and the index of the next available edge to consider. The value for this state would be the maximum beauty achievable using the edges up to the given edge_index.

To implement memoization, create a dictionary memo where keys are tuples of (tail_length, edge_index) and values are the corresponding maximum beauty values. Before calculating the maximum beauty for a particular state, check if it's already present in the memo dictionary. If it is, return the cached value instead of recalculating.

To calculate the maximum beauty for a given state, consider three options:
- Extend the current tail by one vertex (if possible) and recursively calculate the maximum beauty for the new state.
- Create a spine with the current edge_index as its endpoint and recursively calculate the maximum beauty for the remaining edges.
- Do not extend the current tail and move on to the next edge.

Choose the option that maximizes the beauty, update the memo dictionary with the calculated value, and return it.

This plan should correctly solve the problem. It includes edge cases by considering all possible choices at each step.
