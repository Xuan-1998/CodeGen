===BEGIN PLAN===
We can solve this problem using dynamic programming with memoization in a top-down approach.

State: We will use two variables as our state expression - (tail_length, spine_count), where tail_length is the length of the current path forming the hedgehog's tail and spine_count is the number of spines counted so far. This allows us to keep track of the maximum beauty of the hedgehog for different lengths of the tail.

Base Case: The base case would be when the tail has reached its maximum length (n) or when there are no more nodes that can be connected to the tail (i.e., last_node_in_tail is out of bounds).

Function: We define a function dp(tail_length, spine_count) that returns the maximum possible beauty of the hedgehog for the given tail length and spine count. This function will recursively try to add each edge to the tail and calculate the new beauty.

Memoization: We use a dictionary memo to store intermediate results for efficient lookup. The key is (tail_length, spine_count) and the value is the maximum possible beauty of the hedgehog for this state.

Main Logic: We iterate over all edges in the graph and for each edge, we try to add it to the tail. If the new tail length is within our bounds and the last node in the tail is not out of bounds, we calculate the new beauty using dp(tail_length + 1, spine_count + 1) if adding the edge increases the beauty.

Return: The function returns the maximum possible beauty of the hedgehog for the given state. If there are no more nodes that can be connected to the tail (i.e., last_node_in_tail is out of bounds), it returns a default value indicating that we have reached the end of the graph.
