===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, meaning the solution to a larger instance can be constructed from solutions of smaller instances, making it amenable to bottom-up tabulation. You can start by solving the base case and then iteratively build up the solution for larger instances.

The base case is when there are no more edges to consider, i.e., when all vertices have been included in the tail or spines. In this case, the beauty is simply the number of spines, which can be calculated by counting the number of edges that do not belong to the tail.

A state could consist of the set of vertices in the tail, the set of vertices that are still available for use in spines, and the maximum beauty achievable so far. Use a dictionary to store the memoized values, where the key is the current state and the value is the corresponding maximum beauty.

For each edge, iterate over all possible ways to extend the existing tail or spine. For each extension, calculate the new state and check if it has been seen before in the memoization table. If it has, use the stored value; otherwise, calculate the new value recursively and store it for future reference.

When considering an edge to add to the tail, you can either append it to the existing tail or start a new spine from this vertex. When considering adding it to a spine, you can either extend the existing spine or start a new one from this vertex.

To avoid redundant calculations, use a set to keep track of the vertices that have been considered so far in each recursive call.

The plan should be able to handle edge cases such as when there are no edges left and the maximum beauty achievable is simply the number of spines.
