===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, making it amenable to bottom-up tabulation. You can start by solving the base case and then iteratively build up the solution for larger instances.

Define a state as the tuple (t, s, p), where t is the length of the current tail, s is the number of spines formed so far, and p is the number of vertices not yet included in the tail. The transition would be determined by whether the next vertex should be added to the tail or become a new spine.

Dynamically build up a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible beauty at step i and spine j. Initialize the base case as dp[0][0] = 0, representing no edge colored yet.

For each step i from 1 to n:
  For each spine j from 0 to m:
    Calculate the maximum possible beauty considering adding a new edge to the tail or forming a new spine:
      If p > 0: Consider adding a new vertex to the tail and update dp[i][j] accordingly.
      Else: Update dp[i][j] by considering forming a new spine.

Return dp[n][m], representing the maximum possible beauty of a hedgehog.
