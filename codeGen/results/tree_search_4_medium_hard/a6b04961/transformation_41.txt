===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, meaning the solution to a larger instance can be constructed from solutions of smaller instances, making it amenable to bottom-up tabulation.

You can start by solving the base case and then iteratively build up the solution for larger instances.

The base case is when there are no more edges to consider, i.e., when all vertices have been included in the tail or spines. In this case, the beauty is simply the number of spines, which can be calculated by counting the number of edges that do not belong to the tail.

A state could consist of the set of vertices in the tail, the set of vertices that are still available for use in spines, and the maximum beauty achievable so far. This state can be represented using a 1D array with indices ranging from 0 to n, where index i represents the state where the last vertex added to the tail is at index i.

You can then fill up this 1D array iteratively by considering each edge and all possible ways to add the edge to the current tail or use it as a spine. The maximum beauty achievable so far should be updated accordingly.

The final answer will be the value of the cell in the array that corresponds to the state where all vertices have been included in the tail or spines.
