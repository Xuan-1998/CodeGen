===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, meaning the solution to a larger instance can be constructed from solutions of smaller instances, making it amenable to bottom-up tabulation. You can start by solving the base case and then iteratively build up the solution for larger instances.

Define a state as the pair (t, s), where t is the length of the current tail and s is the number of spines formed so far. The base case would be when all vertices have been included in the tail or spines, i.e., t = n or s = m.

Consider adding an edge from u to v to the current hedgehog. If this edge can form a new spine, update the state accordingly. This can be done by incrementing the count of spines if the edge is not part of the tail and does not extend the existing tail.

Dynamically create a dp table filled with values from 1 to n for tails of length t and memoize these values as well. Initialize the dp table with zeros or -infinity, depending on the problem's constraints. The dp table will store the maximum beauty that can be achieved by forming hedgehogs up to tail of length t.

For each edge (u, v), consider adding it to the current hedgehog and update the state accordingly. For each state (t, s), calculate the maximum possible beauty by considering all edges that can form a new spine from the existing hedgehog. This will involve iterating over edges connected to the last vertex in the tail.

The updated dp value at state (t, s) would be the maximum of the current beauty and the beauty obtained by adding an edge and extending the tail.
