===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, meaning the solution to a larger instance can be constructed from solutions of smaller instances, making it amenable to bottom-up tabulation.

The base case is when there are no more edges to consider, i.e., when all vertices have been included in the tail or spines. In this case, the beauty is simply the number of spines, which can be calculated by counting the number of edges that do not belong to the tail.

The state could be the length of the current path (tail) and the number of edges not yet used to extend it.

Initialize a dynamic programming table as a 3D array with dimensions (n+1, m+1, n+1), where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges. The cell at row i, column j, and depth k represents the maximum beauty that can be achieved when the current tail has length i, there are j edges left to consider, and the last vertex in the tail is k.

Iterate through each possible length of the path (tail) from 1 to n.
For each length, iterate through each possible number of edges left to consider from m down to 0.
    Calculate the maximum beauty that can be achieved by either extending the current tail or starting a new spine.
    Update the dynamic programming table accordingly.

The final answer is stored in the cell at row n, column 0, and depth n, which represents the maximum possible beauty of a hedgehog.
