===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, meaning the solution to a larger instance can be constructed from solutions of smaller instances, making it amenable to bottom-up tabulation.

The base case is when there are no more edges to consider, i.e., when all vertices have been included in the tail or spines. In this case, the beauty is simply the number of spines, which can be calculated by counting the number of edges that do not belong to the tail.

A state could consist of the set of vertices in the tail, the set of vertices that are still available for use in spines, and the maximum beauty achievable so far. You can maintain a 2D array dp[n][m+1] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum beauty that can be achieved by considering the first i vertices and j edges.

You start by initializing dp[0][0] = 0, as there is no tail or spines with 0 vertices. Then for each i from 1 to n, you consider all possible edges e connecting vertices k and l such that k <= i and l > i (i.e., the edge does not belong to the current tail).

For each edge e, you calculate the new state by adding the endpoint of the edge that is not in the current tail to the set of available vertices. You also update dp[i][j] based on whether the edge can be used as a spine or not.

Finally, you return the maximum value in the last column of dp, which represents the maximum beauty achievable with all edges.
