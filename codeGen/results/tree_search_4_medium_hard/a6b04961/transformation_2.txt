===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that share common information, making it suitable for a dynamic programming approach with top-down memoization. This allows you to avoid redundant computation and efficiently store intermediate results.

The state expression could be the maximum beauty of a hedgehog that can be achieved by considering all possible tails up to i vertices long, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

Consider the current maximum beauty as the maximum of the previous maximum beauty and the beauty achieved by extending the current tail with a new vertex. This is because we have two choices: either extend the current tail or start a new one. The optimal choice would be the one that gives us the highest beauty.

Initialize the dynamic programming table with zeros. Then, update the values iteratively based on the previously calculated maximum beauty. For each possible length of the tail, calculate the maximum beauty by considering all possible extensions of the current tail. This is done by iterating over all edges that have at least one endpoint in the current tail and updating the maximum beauty accordingly.

Finally, return the value stored in the dynamic programming table corresponding to the maximum possible length of the tail (i.e., n). This would be the maximum possible beauty of a hedgehog.
