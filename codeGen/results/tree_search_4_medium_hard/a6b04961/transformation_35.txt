The problem has an optimal substructure, meaning the solution to a larger instance can be constructed from solutions of smaller instances, making it amenable to bottom-up tabulation.

Start by solving the base case when there are no more edges to consider. In this case, the beauty is simply the number of spines, which can be calculated by counting the number of edges that do not belong to the tail.

The state could represent a subset of vertices that have been included in the tail, along with the number of spines and the maximum possible beauty considering only these vertices. This state can be represented as a tuple (tail, spines, beauty).

Tabulate the results of subproblems in a table, where each cell represents the maximum possible beauty considering only a subset of vertices.

The dynamic programming process can be outlined as follows:
