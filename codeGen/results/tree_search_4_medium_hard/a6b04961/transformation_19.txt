===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that share common information, making it suitable for a dynamic programming approach with top-down memoization. This allows you to avoid redundant computation and efficiently store intermediate results.

A fourth possibility could be defining the state as the maximum beauty that can be achieved by considering only tails up to i vertices long, with no constraints on the number of spines.

The state could represent whether a particular vertex is included in the tail or not. The transition relationship would capture how including this vertex affects the beauty of the hedgehog.

Define dp[i] as the maximum beauty for tails up to i vertices long, considering all possible spines. Initialize it with 0 for i equal to 1. Then, iterate through each edge and update the values in O(n + m) time complexity.

To avoid redundant computation, use a visited array to keep track of the vertices that have been included in the tail so far. When updating dp[i], only consider the edges that connect vertices with indices less than i and have not been included in the tail yet.

For each edge (u, v), update dp[i] by considering two cases: 
1) u is included in the tail: dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[u-1] + 1 * (v not in visited))
2) u is not included in the tail: dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[v-1] + 1 * (u not in visited))

Finally, return dp[n] as the maximum possible beauty of a hedgehog.
