===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, meaning the solution to a larger instance can be constructed from solutions of smaller instances, making it amenable to bottom-up tabulation.

Define a state as the pair (t, s), where t is the length of the current tail and s is the number of spines formed so far. The base case would be when all vertices have been included in the tail or spines, i.e., t = n or s = m.

Consider a state (t, s) as the pair of current tail length and number of spines formed so far. The next state can be either (t + 1, s) if we extend the tail by one vertex, or (t, s + 1) if we form a new spine.

Implement a dictionary to store the calculated values of dp[t][s] to avoid redundant computation.

Let's iterate over all edges. For each edge, consider two cases: either it extends the current tail or forms a new spine.
If it extends the current tail, update the state (t + 1, s) accordingly.
If it forms a new spine, check if the new spine can be added without extending the current tail. If yes, increment the number of spines and keep the same tail length.
Update the maximum beauty seen so far.
