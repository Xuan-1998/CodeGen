===BEGIN PLAN===
State: Define a state as a tuple (last_vertex, visited_vertices) where last_vertex is the most recently added vertex in the tail and visited_vertices is the set of vertices that have been visited so far.

Transition relationships would involve updating these variables based on whether to add a new vertex to the tail or not. The goal is to maximize the beauty by finding the longest possible path.

Memoization can be achieved using a list of lists, where the inner lists represent the state space (last_vertex, visited_vertices) and the outer list is used to store the memoized values.

The base case would be when there are no more edges to consider. In this case, the maximum beauty would be calculated based on the current tail length and number of spines.

To improve the plan, we can use a priority queue to keep track of the vertices that have not been visited yet, sorted by their degree (number of incoming edges). This way, we can efficiently explore all possible paths in the graph.

The potential issue with this plan is that it might be slow due to the number of states that need to be explored. However, by using memoization and a priority queue, we can significantly reduce the time complexity.

Edge cases include when there are no edges or vertices in the graph, which would result in a beauty value of 0.
