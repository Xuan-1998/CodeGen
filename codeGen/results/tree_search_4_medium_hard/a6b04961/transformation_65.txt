===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming with memoization in a top-down approach:

State: Define a state as a tuple (total_beauty, current_path), where total_beauty is the sum of the beauty contributed by all spines found so far and current_path is the current path being considered for extension. The base case would be when there are no more edges to consider.

The transition relationships involve checking if an edge can be safely added to the path without creating a cycle or using an edge more than once. This can be done by maintaining a set of used_edges, which keeps track of the edges already used in the current hedgehog.

To implement memoization, use a recursive function that uses a dictionary to store the results of previously computed subproblems. This would involve caching and retrieving the values of subproblems as needed.

For each edge, consider adding it to the current path. If the edge connects two vertices not yet visited, add the edge to the used_edges set and recursively explore all possible extensions of the current_path. Update total_beauty by adding the length of the new spine (the number of edges between the last vertex in the current_path and a previously visited vertex) times the number of spines found so far.

If no more edges can be added, update total_beauty by multiplying it with the length of the current_path. This would represent the maximum possible beauty of the hedgehog formed so far.

The memoization dictionary would store key-value pairs where keys are tuples representing states and values are integers representing the maximum possible beauty for each state.
