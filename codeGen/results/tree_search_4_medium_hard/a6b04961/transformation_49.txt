===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, meaning the solution to a larger instance can be constructed from solutions of smaller instances, making it amenable to bottom-up tabulation.

Define a state as the tuple (t, s), where t is the length of the current tail and s is the number of spines formed so far. The base case would be when all vertices have been included in the tail or spines, i.e., t = n or s = m.

Define a function dp(t, s) that returns the maximum possible beauty for the hedgehog with tail length t and s spines. Initialize a memoization dictionary memo where memo[(t, s)] is the value of the state (t, s) after exploring all possible choices. Initialize memo with default value 0.

Consider adding an edge from u to v to the current hedgehog. If this edge can form a new spine, update the state accordingly. Update the values in memo accordingly.

The recursive formula would be:

dp(t, s) = max(dp(min(t-1, s), 0) * (t-1)*s, dp(t-1, s+1) * t*s)

Base case: dp(0, s) = dp(t, 0) = 0

Finally, return memo[(n, 0)]

This plan takes into account the optimal substructure of the problem and uses memoization to avoid redundant computations. It also handles the base cases correctly.
