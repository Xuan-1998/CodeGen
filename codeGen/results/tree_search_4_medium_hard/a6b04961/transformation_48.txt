===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, meaning the solution to a larger instance can be constructed from solutions of smaller instances, making it amenable to bottom-up tabulation.

Define a state as the tuple (t, s), where t is the length of the current tail and s is the number of spines formed so far. The base case would be when all vertices have been included in the tail or spines, i.e., t = n or s = m.

Define the state as (t, s) and consider adding an edge from u to v to the current hedgehog. If this edge can form a new spine, update the state accordingly.

Create a table dp where dp[(t, s)] is the maximum possible beauty for a hedgehog with tail of length t and s spines.

Initialize dp[0, 0] = 0, since there's no tail or spines initially. For every edge (u, v), update dp[(i-1, j)], where i is the length of the new tail if u is added to the tail, and j is the number of spines formed by adding this edge.

For each edge, check if it can form a new spine or extend an existing one. If it forms a new spine, update dp[(i, j+1)] with the maximum beauty so far. If it extends an existing spine, update dp[(i-1, j)] accordingly.

Finally, return the maximum value in dp[(n, m)], which represents the maximum possible beauty of a hedgehog.
