===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that share common information, making it suitable for a dynamic programming approach with top-down memoization. This allows you to avoid redundant computation and efficiently store intermediate results.

A suitable state could be defining as the maximum beauty that can be achieved by considering only tails up to i vertices long, and at most k spines. This would allow us to consider all possible tail lengths and spine counts in a single dynamic programming table.

Use a recursive function with memoization, where the state is the tuple (i, k), representing the current tail length and spine count. The function would return the maximum beauty that can be achieved by considering only tails up to i vertices long, and at most k spines.

The base case for the recursion could be when there are no more edges left, in which case the maximum beauty is 0. For each edge, we can consider two options: either include it as part of the tail or not. If we include it, we would recursively call the function with the new tail length and increment the spine count by 1. If we don't include it, we would simply call the function with the same tail length and spine count.

We can use a 2D table dp to store the maximum beauty for each possible (i, k) state. The table would have n+1 rows and m+1 columns, where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges.

The final answer would be the value in the bottom-right cell of the table, which represents the maximum beauty that can be achieved by considering all possible tail lengths and spine counts.
