===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that share common information, making it suitable for a dynamic programming approach with top-down memoization. This allows you to avoid redundant computation and efficiently store intermediate results.

The state expression could be dp[i][j]: the maximum beauty of a hedgehog that can be achieved by considering all possible tails up to i vertices long, ending at vertex j, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ n. Initialize dp[0][j] = 0, since there's no tail initially.

The transition relationship can be formulated as follows:
    1. If the new edge connects to the end of the current tail (i.e., it ends at vertex j), update the tail with the new vertex and consider all possible next vertices for the new tail.
    2. Otherwise, consider a new spine by adding this edge to the maximum beauty seen so far.

Employ a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by processing the edges in order, keeping track of the maximum beauty seen so far.

To avoid redundant computation, update dp[i][j] only when it's actually necessary (i.e., when we find an edge that can extend our current tail). We also need to handle the case where there are multiple possible choices for extending the tail; in this case, take the one with the maximum beauty.

Finally, return the maximum value of dp[n][j] over all vertices j. This represents the maximum possible beauty of a hedgehog.
