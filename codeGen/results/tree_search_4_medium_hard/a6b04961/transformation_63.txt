===BEGIN PLAN===
Define a state as a tuple (path, used_edges) where path is the sequence of vertices and used_edges is a set of edges already used for forming the current hedgehog. The base case would be when there are no more edges to consider.

Initially, all paths have a beauty of 0, and we store this in a memoization dictionary dp.

For each edge (u, v), calculate the transition function as follows:

1. Check if adding this edge to the path creates a cycle. If it does, set the new state's beauty to the same as the current state.
2. If not, check if the edge has been used before. If it has, set the new state's beauty to the same as the current state.
3. Otherwise, calculate the new state's beauty by considering two cases:
   - If v is a part of the path (i.e., v âˆˆ path), then this edge can be safely added to the path, and the new state's beauty would be dp[(path + [v], used_edges | {(u, v)})] * len(path).
   - If v is not in the path, then this edge cannot be safely added to the path (because it would create a spine), so set the new state's beauty to the same as the current state.

Memoize the transition function by storing the results of subproblems in dp. This ensures that each subproblem is solved only once.

Finally, iterate over all possible states and calculate the maximum beauty for each one using dynamic programming. The final answer would be the maximum beauty found.
