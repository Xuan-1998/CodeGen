===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that share common information, making it suitable for a dynamic programming approach with top-down memoization. This allows you to avoid redundant computation and efficiently store intermediate results.

The state expression could be the maximum beauty of a hedgehog that can be achieved by considering all possible tails up to i vertices long, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Consider two cases: 
- Case 1: The new edge connects to the end of the current tail. In this case, update the tail with the new vertex and consider the maximum beauty of a hedgehog that can be achieved by considering all possible tails up to j vertices long, where j is the length of the updated tail.
- Case 2: The new edge does not connect to the end of the current tail. In this case, consider a new spine. 

Use a dictionary-based approach to efficiently store and retrieve intermediate results as you build up the solution.

Initialize memo with all possible tails being of length 1. For each edge, update memo based on the two cases above.
Finally, return memo[n] which represents the maximum beauty of a hedgehog that can be achieved by considering all possible tails up to n vertices long.
