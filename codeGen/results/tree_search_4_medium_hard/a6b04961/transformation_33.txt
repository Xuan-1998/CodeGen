===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, meaning the solution to a larger instance can be constructed from solutions of smaller instances, making it amenable to bottom-up tabulation. You can start by solving the base case and then iteratively build up the solution for larger instances.

The base case is when there are no more edges to consider, i.e., when all vertices have been included in the tail or spines. In this case, the beauty is simply the number of spines, which can be calculated by counting the number of edges that do not belong to the tail.

The state could represent a subset of vertices that have been included in the tail, along with the number of spines and the maximum possible beauty considering only these vertices. Specifically, for each vertex i, we keep track of two values: dp[i], which is the maximum possible beauty considering only the vertices up to i, and count[i], which is the number of edges that do not belong to the tail among the edges incident on i.

The dynamic programming equation would be:
- For the base case (when all vertices have been included), dp[n] = count[n].
- For a given vertex i, let's consider two cases: either the last edge added to the tail ends at i, or it does not. If it ends at i, then the beauty increases by one and we need to update dp[i+1]. If it does not end at i, then the beauty remains the same and we just propagate the value of dp[i] to dp[i+1].
- Update the state with dp[i+1] = max(dp[i+1], dp[i]+1) if the last edge added ends at i, otherwise, dp[i+1] = dp[i].

Finally, return dp[n] as the maximum possible beauty.
