===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming with memoization in a top-down approach. This might involve treating certain subproblems as identical or equivalent, allowing you to reduce the time complexity of your algorithm.

State: Use a tuple (tail_length, number_of_spines) as the state expression, where tail_length is the length of the current hedgehog's tail and number_of_spines is the count of spines found so far. The base case would be when the tail reaches its maximum allowed length.

Maintain three variables: dp[i][j] representing the maximum beauty achievable by adding edges to form a hedgehog tail of length i with j spines, curr_tail_length storing the current length of the hedgehog's tail, and curr_spine_count keeping track of the number of spines seen so far.

For each edge (u, v), consider adding it to the current hedgehog's tail. If u is part of the tail, update curr_tail_length and curr_spine_count accordingly. Then, update dp[i][j] using the maximum beauty achievable by considering all possible tails with length i - 1 and j - 1 spines.
