===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming with memoization in a top-down approach:

State: Use a 3D array dp[tail_length][number_of_spines][direction] as the state expression, where:
    - tail_length is the length of the current hedgehog's tail
    - number_of_spines is the count of spines found so far
    - direction (0 or 1) represents whether to add the current edge to the tail or not

Base case: When the tail reaches its maximum allowed length, return the product of the tail length and the number of spines.

Consider treating each edge as a possible addition to the current hedgehog's tail. This could involve maintaining three variables:
    - current_tail_length: the length of the current hedgehog's tail
    - number_of_spines: the count of spines seen so far
    - direction (0 or 1): whether to add the current edge to the tail or not

Dynamic programming with a 3D table where each cell [i][j][k] represents the maximum beauty that can be achieved by adding j edges to form a hedgehog tail of length i, considering the direction k.

To fill up the dp table:
    - For each edge (u, v), consider two options: add it to the current tail or not.
    - If you choose to add the edge, increment the number_of_spines and update the current_tail_length accordingly.
    - If you don't add the edge, keep the same state.

The final answer is the maximum value in the dp table when the tail reaches its maximum allowed length.
