===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, meaning the solution to a larger instance can be constructed from solutions of smaller instances, making it amenable to bottom-up tabulation.

Define a state as the pair (t, s), where t is the length of the current tail and s is the number of spines formed so far. The base case would be when all vertices have been included in the tail or spines, i.e., t = n or s = m.

Consider a state (t, s) as the pair of current tail length and number of spines formed so far. The next state can be either (t + 1, s) if we extend the tail by one vertex, or (t, s + 1) if we form a new spine.

Define dp[t][s] as the maximum beauty of a hedgehog with a tail of length t and s spines formed so far.

For each edge (u, v), consider all possible next states that can be reached by coloring this edge. If u is in the current tail, update dp[t][s] for all reachable states. Otherwise, update dp[t][s] only if this edge can form a new spine.

The maximum beauty is the maximum value of dp[n-1][m-1].
