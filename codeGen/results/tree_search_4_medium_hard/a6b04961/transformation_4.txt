===BEGIN PLAN===
The state expression could be dp[i][prev_vertex], where i is the length of the current tail and prev_vertex is the last vertex in the tail. The dynamic programming table would have dimensions (n, n), where n is the number of vertices.

The base case for the dynamic programming would be when the length of the tail is 1, in which case the maximum beauty would be the sum of the edges incident on that single vertex.

For longer tails, the maximum beauty would depend on two choices: either the current edge can be part of the tail (in which case we recursively call the function with the next vertex as the previous one), or it cannot be part of the tail (in which case we consider all possible previous vertices and take the maximum).

The state transition would update dp[i][prev_vertex] to be the maximum of these two choices.

To find the maximum possible beauty, we would iterate over all possible lengths of tails from 1 to n, and then for each length i, we would iterate over all possible last vertices in the tail. The maximum value among these would give us the answer.
