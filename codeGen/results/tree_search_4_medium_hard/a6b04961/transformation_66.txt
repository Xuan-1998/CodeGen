===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem using dynamic programming with memoization in a top-down approach, consider the following steps:

State: Define a state as a tuple (tail_length, tail_vertices), where tail_length is the length of the current path and tail_vertices is the set of vertices that make up the current path. The base case would be when there are no more edges to consider.

Transition relationships involve updating these variables based on whether to add a new vertex to the tail or not. For each state, calculate the maximum beauty achievable by adding a new vertex to the tail and considering all possible spines.

Create a dictionary where the keys are the state tuples and the values are the maximum beauty that can be achieved for each state.

Initialize the memoization table with base cases (when there are no more edges) and fill it up recursively, considering all possible transitions and updating the states accordingly. Finally, return the maximum beauty achievable from the initial state.
