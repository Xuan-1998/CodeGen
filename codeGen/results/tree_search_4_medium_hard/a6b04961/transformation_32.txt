===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, meaning the solution to a larger instance can be constructed from solutions of smaller instances, making it amenable to bottom-up tabulation.

Consider a state representing the maximum beauty that can be achieved by the hedgehog with its tail ending at vertex i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

State: dp[i][j] = the maximum beauty that can be achieved by the hedgehog with its tail ending at vertex i and the last colored edge being from j. It depends on whether we extend the current tail or start a new spine.

The transition relationship would involve checking if there is an uncolored edge incident to i that is not connected to j, and if so, choose it as the new spine.

To avoid duplicate computations, implement memoization using recursion to store previously computed values in a dictionary. 

For each vertex i, consider all possible predecessors j in the path such that the edge (j, i) is colored. For each predecessor j, compute the maximum beauty of the hedgehog with its tail ending at i and the last colored edge being from j.

The final answer would be the maximum value of dp[n], where n is the last vertex.
