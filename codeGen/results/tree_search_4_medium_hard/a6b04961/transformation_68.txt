===BEGIN PLAN===
State: Define a state as a tuple (tail_beauty, last_vertex), where tail_beauty is the length of the current tail and last_vertex is the most recently added vertex in the tail. The base case would be when there are no more edges to consider.

Function take_current_state(state):
    if no more edges:
        return 0
    else:
        for each edge:
            if edge connects to last_vertex or not visited yet:
                new_state = update state with new vertex and edge
                max_beauty = maximum of the current best and beauty from the recursive call on new_state
                return max_beauty
