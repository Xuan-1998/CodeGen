===BEGIN PLAN===
State: Consider using a tuple (tail, last_node_in_tail) as the state expression, where tail is the current path of the hedgehog's tail and last_node_in_tail is the most recent node added to the tail. The base case would be when the tail has reached its maximum length or when there are no more nodes that can be connected to the tail.

Step 1: Initialize a memoization table dp with size n x (n+1), where dp[i][j] represents the maximum beauty of a hedgehog ending at node i and having a tail of length j.

Step 2: For each edge (u, v) in the graph:
    - If u is not in the current tail, consider adding it to the tail. Calculate the new tail by appending u to the end of the current tail.
    - Calculate the number of spines that can be formed with the new tail and the remaining nodes.
    - Update dp[v][j+1] if the calculated beauty is greater than its current value.

Step 3: For each node i in the graph, find the maximum beauty of a hedgehog ending at node i by considering all possible tails of length up to i.
    - Initialize max_beauty = 0
    - For each j from 1 to i:
        + Calculate the tail and spines for this hedgehog.
        + Update max_beauty if the calculated beauty is greater than its current value.

Step 4: Return dp[n][n+1] as the maximum possible beauty of a hedgehog.
