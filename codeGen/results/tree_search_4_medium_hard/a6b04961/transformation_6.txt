The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that share common information, making it suitable for a dynamic programming approach with top-down memoization. This allows you to avoid redundant computation and efficiently store intermediate results.

The state expression could be the maximum beauty of a hedgehog that can be achieved by considering all possible tails up to i vertices long, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

To handle the transition relationship more effectively, consider using a 3D array: dp[i][j][k] represents the maximum beauty of a hedgehog with j edges considered and k tail vertices, where the current edge connects to the end of the tail if i is true (i.e., it's the last vertex in the tail), or not if i is false.

The transition relationship can be formulated based on whether the new edge connects to the end of the current tail or not. If it does (i = 1), update the tail with the new vertex; otherwise, consider a new spine (i = 0). In both cases, update the beauty according to the number of spines and the length of the tail.

Consider using a 3D array to store the maximum beauty for each possible tail length, number of edges considered, and whether the current edge connects to the end of the tail or not.
