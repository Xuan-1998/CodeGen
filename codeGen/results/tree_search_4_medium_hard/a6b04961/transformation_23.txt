===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that share common information, making it suitable for a dynamic programming approach with top-down memoization. This allows you to avoid redundant computation and efficiently store intermediate results.

Define the state as dp[i][k], where i is the length of the tail and k is the number of spines. The state represents the maximum beauty that can be achieved by considering only tails up to i vertices long and at most k spines.

The recursive formula would be:
dp[i][k] = max(dp[j-1][k-1] + (i - j + 1) * (n - i)) for all 1 ≤ j ≤ i

Here, we consider the maximum beauty that can be achieved by considering only tails up to j vertices long and at most k-1 spines, plus the additional beauty gained from the new spine.

The base case would be dp[0][k] = 0, as there is no tail or spine when the length is 0.

To improve the plan, we can sort the edges by their endpoints to reduce the time complexity of the recursive formula. This is because we only need to consider edges that have one endpoint in the current tail and the other endpoint not in the tail.

Potential issues with the plan include handling edge cases where i or k is 0, as well as ensuring that the recursive formula does not exceed the maximum length or number of spines allowed.
