===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using dynamic programming with memoization in a top-down approach to solve this problem.

State: Use a tuple (path, last_node) as the state expression, where path is the current sequence of nodes forming the hedgehog's tail and last_node is the most recent node added to the tail. The base case would be when the tail has reached its maximum length or when there are no more nodes that can be connected to the tail.

Store intermediate results for each node in a 1D array to avoid redundant calculations.

For each edge (u, v) in the input graph:
    For each possible tail ending at u:
        Calculate the beauty of adding this edge as a spine.
        Store the maximum beauty seen so far in a variable.
    Return the stored maximum beauty value.

This plan correctly identifies the dynamic programming approach and uses a suitable state expression. It also avoids redundant calculations by storing intermediate results for each node.

The only potential issue is that it does not consider pruning the search space by using a priority queue to always explore the tails with the highest possible beauty first. This could be an optimization, especially when dealing with large graphs.
