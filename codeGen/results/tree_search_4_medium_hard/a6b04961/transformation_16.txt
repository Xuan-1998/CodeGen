The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that share common information, making it suitable for a dynamic programming approach with top-down memoization.

State: Consider the maximum beauty achievable given the last vertex in the tail and all edges connected to it. The state will include the maximum beauty achieved with the current tail length and the number of spines.

Transition: When adding an edge to the tail, update the state based on whether it results in a longer tail or not. This involves updating the state considering the maximum beauty achievable from the previous tail ends and the new edges that can be connected.

Define a dynamic programming table where the state is the maximum beauty achievable given the last vertex in the tail and all edges connected to it, and the size of the table will be n (number of vertices).

The dynamic programming approach can be implemented as follows:

1. Create an array dp where dp[i] represents the maximum beauty achievable with i+1 vertices in the tail.

2. Initialize dp[0] = 0 since there are no edges initially.

3. For each edge (u, v), find all possible tails that end at vertex u and update the state considering the maximum beauty achievable from the previous tail ends and the new edges that can be connected to v.

4. Update dp[i] based on whether adding this edge results in a longer tail or not.

5. Finally, return dp[n-1] as the maximum possible value of the hedgehog's beauty.

This plan takes into account all necessary information and is an efficient way to solve the problem.
