===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with tabulation, as this problem has an optimal substructure.

The state represents the number of matrices that have a trace equal to N and a positive determinant, given the first element of the matrix. Let dp[i][j] be the number of such matrices where the first element is i and the second element (the top-right corner) is j.

Initialize the base case: dp[0][0] = 1, since there's only one way to form a 2x2 positive invertible integer matrix with trace N and determinant 1 (when both elements are 1).

For each i from 1 to N:
    For each j from i to N:
        If the sum of the first two elements in the row is equal to N, then there are 2 options for the bottom-right corner: either it's equal to j or it's one less than j. 
        Update dp[i][j] as follows:

            - If j > i, update dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j].
            - Else if j < i, update dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j+1] + dp[i-1][j].

This approach takes into account all possible combinations for each entry in the matrix.
