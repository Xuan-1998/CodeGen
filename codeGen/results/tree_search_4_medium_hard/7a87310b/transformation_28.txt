===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with tabulation, as this problem has an optimal substructure.

Define the state as dp[i], representing the maximum number of matrices that can be formed with a trace of i and a positive determinant, for all 1 <= i <= N.

The transition relationship is:

dp[i] = sum(dp[k] * (i-k+1) for k in range(min(i, 2), i)) if i % 2 == 0 else dp[i-1]

This is because the number of matrices with a trace of i and positive determinant depends on the number of matrices with traces of k, where k is less than or equal to i.

Use a dictionary to store intermediate results and retrieve them when needed, rather than recomputing them. This can be done by initializing a dictionary dp with keys ranging from 1 to N, and storing the calculated values in it.

Finally, return dp[N] as the answer, which represents the maximum number of matrices that can be formed with a trace of N and a positive determinant.
