===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by counting the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N, and then selecting the ones with positive determinant.

State: (i, j), where i is the row sum and j is the column sum.
Transition: Update the state by considering all possible values k such that i - k and j - k are valid sums. This can be done using a dynamic programming table dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of invertible matrices with trace i and column sum j.

The base case would be the count of invertible matrices when the trace is 0 or 1, which is relatively easy to calculate.
For trace value 0, there's only one possibility: the entire matrix being zero. So dp[0][j] = 1 for all j.
For trace value 1, there are two possibilities: either the top-left corner is 1 and the rest of the matrix is zero, or the bottom-right corner is 1 and the rest of the matrix is zero. So dp[1][j] = 2 for all j.

Memoize the function that calculates the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N.
The final answer will be the sum of dp[i][j] over all i and j such that dp[i][j] represents the count of invertible matrices with trace i and positive determinant j.
