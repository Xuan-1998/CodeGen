===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by counting the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N, and then selecting the ones with positive determinant.

Consider using a state like (trace_value, matrix_elements) where matrix_elements are the possible values for the elements of the 2x2 matrix. The base case would be the count of invertible matrices when trace equals 0 or 1 and all matrix elements are less than or equal to N.

Formulate state and transition relationships based on the number of invertible matrices that can be formed with trace equal to trace_value - 1 and with the given constraints. Specifically, consider the following:

* If the current trace value is 2, then there's only one possible combination for the matrix elements.
* If the current trace value is greater than 2, then we need to consider all combinations of matrix elements that satisfy the condition (trace_value - 1) and calculate the count of invertible matrices.

Iterative approach using a nested loop:
Initialize a table with dimensions (N+1) x ((2*N)^2), where each cell represents the count of invertable matrices for a given trace value and matrix elements. The table can be initialized with the base case values, i.e., when trace equals 0 or 1.

The transition relationship would involve iterating over all possible combinations of matrix elements for the current trace value, calculating the count of invertible matrices for each combination, and updating the corresponding cell in the table.

To ensure the plan is correct, consider edge cases such as N being 1 or 2. For these values, it's clear that there are no positive invertible integer matrices with a trace equal to N, so we can use these as base cases.

The plan includes edge cases by considering the base case when trace equals 0 or 1 and all matrix elements are less than or equal to N. It also considers edge cases for N being 1 or 2.
