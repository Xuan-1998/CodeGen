===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by counting the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N, and then selecting the ones with positive determinant.

Let the state be (trace_value, is_positive_determinant) where is_positive_determinant is a boolean indicating whether there are any invertible matrices with trace equal to trace_value and positive determinant.

The state could be the number of invertible integer matrices with a given trace value, where each state transition corresponds to adding one more element to the matrix. This can be done using dynamic programming, where the base cases would be the calculation of the number of invertible matrices for trace values 1 and 2.

Use memoization with the state being a tuple of trace_value and is_positive_determinant, where memoization stores the count of invertible matrices for each state and reuses previously computed values.

To improve the plan, we can also store the actual counts of invertible matrices instead of just storing whether they are positive or not. This would allow us to calculate the total count more efficiently.

The potential issue with the plan is that it might be too complex to implement correctly. Also, the plan does not account for edge cases where N is less than 3, in which case there are no invertible matrices.
