===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with tabulation, as this problem has an optimal substructure.

The base case is when the trace is 0 or negative, in which case there are no matrices that meet the condition. This can be handled by initializing dp[0] = dp[-1] = 0.

For positive traces, consider each possible value of N as a state. The transition relation is that for any given state (N), the number of ways to get there is equal to the sum of the number of positive invertible integer matrices with trace N-2 and the number of positive invertible integer matrices with trace N-1.

To avoid redundant calculations, use dynamic programming with memoization. Store the results of subproblems in a dictionary dp as you go along, and return them when needed instead of recalculating them.

Use a bottom-up approach to fill up the dp table from 0 to N. Start by initializing dp[0] = 1 (since there is exactly one way to form a 2x2 matrix with trace 0), then recursively fill up the table using the transition relation.

Finally, return dp[N] as the total number of positive invertible integer matrices with trace N and positive determinant.
