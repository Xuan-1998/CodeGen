===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with tabulation, as this problem has an optimal substructure.

The base case is when the trace is 0, in which case there are no matrices that meet the condition. For negative traces, the number of positive invertible integer matrices is also 0.

You can define a recursive formula for the number of positive invertible integer matrices with trace N:

- Let f(N) be the number of positive invertible integer matrices with trace N.
- If N is even, then any such matrix must have an odd number on its diagonal. There are (N/2 + 1) ways to choose this value, and for each choice, there are (N/2 - 1) ways to fill in the other element of the main diagonal. For each such pair of elements, there are N choices for the off-diagonal elements that will result in a positive determinant.
- If N is odd, then any such matrix must have an even number on its diagonal. There are (N/2 + 1) ways to choose this value, and for each choice, there are (N/2 - 1) ways to fill in the other element of the main diagonal. For each such pair of elements, there are N choices for the off-diagonal elements that will result in a positive determinant.

Implement tabulation by creating a 1D array where each cell represents the number of positive invertible integer matrices with a given trace, and use a bottom-up approach to fill up the table.
