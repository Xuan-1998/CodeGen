1. Consider a bottom-up approach with tabulation, as this problem has an optimal substructure.
The state represents the number of matrices that have a trace equal to N and a positive determinant, given the first element of the matrix.
2. Initialize a table dp[i] for 0 <= i <= N, where dp[i] stores the cumulative count of matrices that have a trace equal to i and a positive determinant up to size (i+1).
3. For each state i, calculate the number of ways to fill the top-right corner of the matrix given its trace is i and determinant is positive.
4. Calculate this cumulative count using dynamic programming: dp[i] = sum(dp[j-1] * (N-j+1) for j in range(1, i+1)) + 1 if i > 0; 
5. Initialize dp[0] to 1 since there's only one way to fill a 2x2 matrix with trace 0 and positive determinant.
6. Calculate the number of Positive Invertible Integer Matrices that have a trace of N and a positive determinant by dp[N].
