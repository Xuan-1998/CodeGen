===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with tabulation, as this problem has an optimal substructure.

Define the state as the maximum number of matrices that can be formed with a trace of i and a positive determinant, for all 1 <= i <= N.

The transition relationship is dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][j-1] for k in range(j)) if i == N else 0. This captures the idea that the number of matrices with trace i and positive determinant increases as we consider larger traces up to N.

To ensure correctness, add a base case: dp[0][j] = 1 for all j, since there is exactly one matrix with trace 0 (the zero matrix) that has a positive determinant. This base case also implies that the problem has at least one solution, which is necessary for memoization to work.

Implement memoization using Python's built-in decorator @lru_cache(), to avoid redundant computations and optimize the process.

Initialize dp with zeros: dp = [[0] * (N+1) for _ in range(N+1)].
Fill in base cases: for j in range(N+1): dp[0][j] = 1
