The plan is mostly correct, but there are some potential issues that need to be addressed.

To improve the plan:

1. **State Definition**: The state should be defined as (trace_value, determinant_sign). This is because the problem requires the count of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N with positive determinant.
2. **Transition Function**: For each new trace value t, consider all possible pairs of values a and b such that t = a + b. However, we need to ensure that the corresponding matrix is invertible and has positive determinant. This can be done by checking if (a - b) * 2 > 0 and abs(a - b) < t.
3. **Memoization**: Create a dictionary memo that stores the calculated counts, allowing for quick lookups and avoiding redundant calculations.

Here's the updated plan:
