===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by counting the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N, and then selecting the ones with positive determinant.

The state can be defined as just the trace value itself, since the problem only cares about counting the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N. The base case would be the count of invertible matrices when the trace is 0 or 1, which is relatively easy to calculate.

State: (trace_value), Transition: For each new trace value t, consider all possible pairs of values a and b such that t = a + b, and update the count for the corresponding trace value.

The transition function can be implemented by iterating over all possible values of a and b, and updating the counts accordingly. This can be done using a dynamic programming approach with a bottom-up approach to build up the counts from smaller trace values to larger ones.

Base case: When the trace is 0 or 1, there's only one way to construct an invertible matrix (i.e., [[1, 0], [0, 1]] for trace 0 and [[2, 0], [0, 1]] for trace 1), so the base case count is 1.

For larger trace values, iterate over all possible pairs of a and b such that t = a + b. For each pair, update the count by adding the counts of invertible matrices with traces a and b.

The final answer would be the count of invertible matrices with trace N and positive determinant.
