===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by counting the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N, and then selecting the ones with positive determinant.

Let the state be (trace_value, is_positive_determinant) where is_positive_determinant is a boolean indicating whether there are any invertible matrices with trace equal to trace_value and positive determinant.

The state could be the set of all possible integer values for the matrix elements that result in a given trace value and positive determinant.

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use dynamic programming. Create a dictionary dp where the key is (trace_value, is_positive_determinant) and the value is the count of invertible matrices with the given trace value and positive determinant.

For each possible trace value from 1 to N:
    - Initialize dp[(trace_value, False)] = 0 (no invertible matrix can have negative determinant).
    - If trace_value is 2 or 3, dp[(trace_value, True)] = 1 (only one way to create a positive determinant).
    - For each possible value for the matrix element at position [0][0]:
        - Calculate the sum of the two other elements in the same row.
        - Check if this sum is equal to trace_value - the current element.
        - If it is, update dp[(trace_value, True)] with the number of ways to choose the remaining elements (which can be calculated recursively).
    - Return dp[(N, True)]

This plan should correctly solve the problem. The edge cases are handled by initializing dp[(1, False)] = 0 and dp[(2 or 3, True)] = 1.
