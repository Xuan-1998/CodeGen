===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by counting the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N, and then selecting the ones with positive determinant.

Consider using a state like (trace_value, matrix_elements) where matrix_elements are the possible values for the elements of the 2x2 matrix. The base case would be the count of invertible matrices when trace equals 0 or 1 and all matrix elements are less than or equal to N.
Use memoization with a dictionary to store intermediate results and update them dynamically as needed.

State:
    - trace_value: integer from 0 to N
    - matrix_elements: list of integers representing the possible values for the elements of the 2x2 matrix

Base Case:
    - (0, []) : 1 (identity matrix)
    - (1, [N]) : 1 (matrix with all elements equal to N)

Transition Function:
    - For each trace_value from 1 to N
        - Initialize count = 0
        - Iterate over all possible combinations of matrix_elements that sum up to trace_value
            - For each combination
                - Calculate the determinant of the corresponding matrix
                - If the determinant is positive, increment count
        - Store the result in the dictionary

Main Function:
    - Initialize dp = {}
    - Initialize total_count = 0
    - Iterate over all possible trace_values from 1 to N
        - If the result for the current trace_value exists in the dictionary, add it to total_count
        - Otherwise, calculate the result using the transition function and store it in the dictionary before adding it to total_count
    - Return total_count

This plan should work correctly. It considers all possible trace values and counts the number of invertible matrices with positive determinant for each value.
