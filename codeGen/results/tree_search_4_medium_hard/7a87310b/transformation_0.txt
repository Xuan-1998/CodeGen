===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming to count the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N, and then selecting the ones with positive determinant.

Let the state be (trace_value, is_positive_determinant) where is_positive_determinant is a boolean indicating whether there are any invertible matrices with trace equal to trace_value and positive determinant. The state transition could be the number of invertible integer matrices with a given trace value, where each state transition corresponds to adding one more element to the matrix.

To solve this problem, we will maintain an array dp such that dp[i][j] represents the number of invertible integer matrices with trace equal to i and positive determinant, and is_positive_determinant equals j.

We can initialize dp[0][0] = 1 because there is exactly one way to create a matrix with trace 0 (the zero matrix) and positive determinant.

For each i from 1 to N:
    For each j from 0 to i:
        If i - j is not greater than 2, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j+1]
        Else if j == 0 or j == i, then dp[i][j] = 0
        Otherwise, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j+1]

Finally, the number of invertible integer matrices with trace N and positive determinant is the sum of all values in the array that satisfy the condition.

This solution has a time complexity of O(N^2) and a space complexity of O(N^2).
