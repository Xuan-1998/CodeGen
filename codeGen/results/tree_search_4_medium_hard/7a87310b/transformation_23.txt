===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with tabulation, as this problem has an optimal substructure.

Define the state as the maximum number of matrices that can be formed with a trace of i and a positive determinant, for all 1 <= i <= N.
State is (i, j) where i is the current trace value and j is the total count of matrices formed so far.
Consider using a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of matrices that can be formed with a trace of i and a positive determinant, for all 1 <= i <= N and 0 <= j <= N.

For each state (i, j), we can calculate the count of matrices that have a trace of i + 2 and a positive determinant. This is because any matrix with a trace of i + 2 will have at least one element in its main diagonal equal to i + 1.
We need to consider two cases: 
- The top-left or bottom-right element of the current matrix is i + 1.
- The top-right or bottom-left element of the current matrix is i + 1.

For the first case, we can form a new matrix with a trace of i + 2 by adding an i x (i + 2) identity matrix to the left or right side of the current matrix. 
For the second case, we can form a new matrix with a trace of i + 2 by adding an (i + 1) x (i + 2) identity matrix below or above the current matrix.

We can also consider two more cases: 
- The top-left element is i and the bottom-right element is i + 1.
- The bottom-left element is i and the top-right element is i + 1.

For each of these cases, we need to ensure that the resulting matrix has a positive determinant. This can be checked by calculating the determinant using the formula (a * d) - (b * c).

Initialize dp[0][j] for all j to 1, because there is only one way to form a 2x2 matrix with any trace and a positive determinant.

For each i from 1 to N:
    For each j from 0 to N:
        Calculate the count of matrices that can be formed with a trace of i + 2 and a positive determinant.
        Update dp[i][j] as the maximum of the current value and the calculated count.
Return dp[N][N] as the answer.
