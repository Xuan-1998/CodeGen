===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by counting the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N, and then selecting the ones with positive determinant.

The state can be defined as just the trace value itself, since the problem only cares about counting the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N. The base case would be the count of invertible matrices when the trace is 0 or 1, which is relatively easy to calculate.

State: trace
Transition: For a given trace i, consider all possible values of j such that i - j and j are valid sums for the matrix.
Since we're considering all possible combinations of row and column sums, this is equivalent to generating all permutations of (i, i) where i is the trace. 

Dynamically allocate memory for a 1D array based on the maximum trace value and update it recursively as needed.

Let count[i] be the number of invertible matrices with trace i.
Base case: count[0] = 1 (the only invertible matrix with trace 0 is [[1, 0], [0, 1]])
Base case: count[1] = 2 (the two invertible matrices with trace 1 are [[1, 1], [0, 1]] and [[1, 0], [1, 1]])

Transition:
For i > 1, consider all possible values of j such that i - j and j are valid sums for the matrix. If there is an invertible matrix with trace j and row sum i - j, then add it to the count.

This plan takes into account edge cases (trace = 0 and trace = 1) and provides a correct approach to solving the problem.
