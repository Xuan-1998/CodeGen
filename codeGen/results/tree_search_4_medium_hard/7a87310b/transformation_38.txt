===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with tabulation, as this problem has an optimal substructure.

The base case is when the trace is 0 or negative, in which case there are no matrices that meet the condition. This can be represented as a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of positive invertible integer matrices with trace i and determinant j.

You can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. You can consider each possible value of N as a state. The transition relation is that for any given state (N), the number of ways to get there is equal to the number of positive invertible integer matrices with trace N-1, because you are adding one more element to the matrix.

Implement a 2D array where each cell represents the number of positive invertible integer matrices with trace N-1, and update it based on the transition relation. 

To improve this plan, you can consider the following:

* Initialize the base case correctly (i.e., when trace is 0 or negative).
* Calculate the determinant for each possible combination of elements in the matrix.
* Handle edge cases such as when N is 1 or 2.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
