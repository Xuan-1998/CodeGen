===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by counting the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N, and then selecting the ones with positive determinant.

Let the state be (trace_value, is_positive_determinant) where is_positive_determinant is a boolean indicating whether there are any invertible matrices with trace equal to trace_value and positive determinant. 

The state could be the set of all possible integer values for the matrix elements that result in a given trace value and positive determinant.

Use a recursive function with memoization to keep track of the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computations.

For each trace value, count the number of invertible matrices with that trace value. To do this, iterate over all possible integer values for the top-left element of the matrix. For each such value, calculate the sum of the remaining two elements (based on the given trace value), ensuring they are integers and the resulting matrix is invertible.

Memoize the results to avoid redundant calculations. The function should return a boolean indicating whether there exists an invertible matrix with the given trace value and positive determinant.

Finally, iterate over all trace values from 1 to N, count the number of invertible matrices for each trace value, and select the ones with positive determinant.
