===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with tabulation, as this problem has an optimal substructure.

Define the state as the maximum number of matrices that can be formed with a trace of i and a positive determinant, for all 1 <= i <= N.
State is (i, j) where i is the current trace value and j is the number of matrices formed so far with a trace of i and a positive determinant.

Use memoization to store the results of subproblems as you solve them, allowing you to avoid redundant computation and improve performance.

For each 1 <= i <= N:
  Initialize dp[i][j] = 0 for all j.
  
  For each possible matrix A with a trace of i and a positive determinant:
    Calculate the value of j such that A^T * A has a trace of i and a positive determinant.
    Update dp[i][j + 1] = dp[i][j] + 1.

Return dp[N][0].
