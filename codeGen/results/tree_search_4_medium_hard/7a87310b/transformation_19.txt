===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by counting the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N, and then selecting the ones with positive determinant.

We can use dynamic programming by maintaining a state like (trace_value, matrix_elements) where matrix_elements are the possible values for the elements of the 2x2 matrix. The base case would be the count of invertible matrices when trace equals 0 or 1 and all matrix elements are less than or equal to N.

Formulate state and transition relationships based on the number of invertible matrices that can be formed with trace equal to trace_value - 1 and with the given constraints. We can use memoization using a dictionary to store the intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

The dynamic programming equation would be: dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][l] where k ranges from i-1 to min(i, N) and l ranges from j-min(N,j),j+1,...,max(N-j,N-i) such that (k+l)=i and the matrix is invertible.

To improve this plan, we can use a more efficient data structure than a dictionary for memoization, like a 2D array.

The potential issues with this plan are:

* The base case might not be correct, as trace equals 0 or 1 doesn't guarantee that the matrix has a positive determinant.
* We didn't consider edge cases where N is less than or equal to 3.

To address these issues, we can modify the base case to handle the special cases where N is less than or equal to 3. For example, if N equals 2 or 1, there's only one possible matrix that meets the conditions.

The updated version of the plan would be:
