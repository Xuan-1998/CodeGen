The problem can be solved by counting the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N, and then selecting the ones with positive determinant.

Consider using a state like (trace_value, matrix_elements) where matrix_elements are the possible values for the elements of the 2x2 matrix. The base case would be the count of invertible matrices when trace equals 0 or 1 and all matrix elements are less than or equal to N.

Use a state like (trace_value, determinant) where determinant is the possible value for the determinant of the 2x2 matrix. This allows us to keep track of the number of matrices with positive determinant for each trace value.

Utilizing a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing the table with base cases and filling in the rest of the table iteratively.
