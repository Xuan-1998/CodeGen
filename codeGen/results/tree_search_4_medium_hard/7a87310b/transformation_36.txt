===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with tabulation, as this problem has an optimal substructure.

The base case is when the trace is 0 or negative, in which case there are no matrices that meet the condition.

You can use dynamic programming by creating a table where each cell dp[i] represents the number of positive invertible integer matrices with trace i. The transition relation can be formulated as follows: for any i, if we have found the number of matrices with traces j and k for j < i and k < i, then we can form a matrix with trace i by adding two j-k matrices or one i-j matrix.

To avoid overcounting, we need to ensure that each matrix is only counted once. This can be achieved by keeping track of the number of distinct matrices at each step.

Implement tabulation by iteratively updating the table from bottom-up, starting from small traces and moving towards larger ones.

For example, when calculating dp[i], we can use the values in dp[j] and dp[k] for j < i and k < i to calculate the value of dp[i].

Note that the base case is important as it ensures that the dynamic programming approach does not get stuck in an infinite loop trying to find a solution.
