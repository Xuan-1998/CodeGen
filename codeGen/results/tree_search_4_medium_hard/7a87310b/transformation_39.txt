===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with tabulation, as this problem has an optimal substructure.

The base case is when the trace is 0 or negative, in which case there are no matrices that meet the condition. This can be handled separately and does not affect the overall dynamic programming approach.

To improve the plan:

* Instead of using a recursive function with memoization, consider using a bottom-up tabulation approach where you iterate over all possible values of N and fill up a table with the results.
* Initialize the base case when N is 0 or negative, and set the value to 0. This handles edge cases correctly.

Here's the updated plan:
