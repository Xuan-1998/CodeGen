===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by counting the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N, and then selecting the ones with positive determinant.

We will use dynamic programming to count the number of invertible matrices. The state will be (trace_value, first_element) where the first element is the possible value for one of the elements in the 2x2 matrix.

The base case would be the count of invertible matrices when trace equals 0 or 1 and all matrix elements are less than or equal to N. This can be calculated using a brute-force approach by trying out different values for the first element and checking if they form an invertible matrix with the remaining two elements that satisfy the trace constraint.

For larger trace values, we can build up the solutions from smaller subproblems. Specifically, given a trace value t, let's consider the number of invertible matrices with trace t and determinant d. We know that the trace of the matrix is equal to the sum of its diagonal elements, so one of the off-diagonal elements must be (t - 2 * first_element) / 2.

We can then use this information to recursively count the number of invertible matrices for smaller trace values. For example, if t = 4 and d = 1, we know that one of the off-diagonal elements is -1, so we can count the number of invertible matrices with trace 3 and determinant 1, which is a smaller subproblem.

This approach allows us to build up the solutions for larger trace values in O(N^2) time. We then need to select the ones with positive determinant, which takes constant time.

The plan includes edge cases by considering the base case of trace equals 0 or 1.
