===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with tabulation, as this problem has an optimal substructure.

Define the state as the maximum number of matrices that can be formed with a trace of i and a positive determinant, for all 1 <= i <= N. State is (i, d) where i is the current trace value and d is the current determinant.

The transition relationship is dp[i][d] = sum(dp[k][d-1] for k in range(i)) if d > 0 else 0, considering that a matrix with positive determinant has at least one positive element on its diagonal (and hence the trace) to ensure invertibility.

DP with a 2D array and two nested loops: 
- The outer loop iterates over all possible traces i from 1 to N.
- The inner loop iterates over all possible determinants d, from 1 to the maximum value of determinant for the given trace (which is N as well).

The base case would be dp[0][d] = 1 if d == 1, representing the single identity matrix with positive determinant.

To avoid calculating unnecessary values and improve efficiency, we use memoization to store and reuse intermediate results.
