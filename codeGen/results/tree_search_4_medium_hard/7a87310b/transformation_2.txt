The plan can be improved by using memoization instead of dynamic programming. Memoization will help in reducing the time complexity.

Here's the updated plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by counting the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N, and then selecting the ones with positive determinant.
Let the state be (trace_value, is_positive_determinant) where is_positive_determinant is a boolean indicating whether there are any invertible matrices with trace equal to trace_value and positive determinant.

Use memoization by building a 2D table where each cell (i, j) represents the number of invertible matrices with trace i and a positive determinant, where j is a flag indicating whether any such matrix exists. This approach would require O(N^2) space complexity.
To calculate the state for each cell, iterate over all possible values of the matrix elements that result in the given trace value and positive determinant.

The base case would be when the trace_value is 1, where there's only one way to get it (i.e., a diagonal matrix with the value 1).

For larger trace_values, calculate the state by considering all possible ways to achieve the trace_value. For each possible way, check if the resulting determinant is positive and update the state accordingly.

This approach would have a time complexity of O(N^2) because it needs to iterate over all possible values of the matrix elements for each cell in the table.
