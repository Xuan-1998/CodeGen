===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming with memoization to count the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N, and then selecting the ones with positive determinant.

State: (trace_value), Transition: For each new trace value t, consider all possible pairs of values a and b such that t = a + b, and update the count for the corresponding trace value.

To improve the plan:

* Initialize a table with size (N+1) x (N+1), where the entry at row i and column j represents the number of invertible matrices with trace i and determinant j.
* Fill in the base case: when t = 0 or 1, there is only one possible matrix (the identity matrix), so set the count to 1 for these trace values.
* For each new trace value t > 1, iterate over all possible pairs of a and b such that t = a + b. For each pair, calculate the corresponding determinant d = ab - c^2 (where c is the common value between a and b). If d is positive, increment the count for the corresponding trace value.
* Return the count for the target trace value N.

Edge cases:
* Handle the case where t = 1 or t = 0 separately, as there is only one possible matrix in these cases.
* Ensure that the table is filled in correctly to avoid infinite loops.

This plan takes into account all edge cases and uses dynamic programming with memoization to efficiently count the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value. It also handles the base case correctly by setting the count to 1 when t = 0 or 1.
