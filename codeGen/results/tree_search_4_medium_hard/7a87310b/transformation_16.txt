===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by counting the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N, and then selecting the ones with positive determinant.

Let's consider using a state like (trace_value, matrix_elements) where matrix_elements are the possible values for the elements of the 2x2 matrix. The base case would be the count of invertible matrices when trace equals 0 or 1 and all matrix elements are less than or equal to N.

Use a state like (trace_value, determinant) where determinant is the possible value for the determinant of the 2x2 matrix.

Implementing a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary or cache. The recursive function will take two parameters: trace_value and matrix_elements. It will return the count of invertible matrices with the given trace value and matrix elements, considering all possible values for the remaining element in the bottom-right corner of the 2x2 matrix.

The base case would be when trace equals 0 or 1, or when all matrix elements are less than or equal to N. In this case, we can simply count the number of invertible matrices with the given conditions.

For each recursive step, we need to check if the current matrix is invertible and has a positive determinant. If it does, then add its count to the total count of invertible matrices.

Finally, return the total count of invertible matrices as the result for the given trace value.
