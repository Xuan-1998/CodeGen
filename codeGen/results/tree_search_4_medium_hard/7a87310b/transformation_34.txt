===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with tabulation, as this problem has an optimal substructure.

The base case is when the trace is 0 or negative, in which case there are no matrices that meet the condition. This is because a matrix with trace 0 or less would have a determinant of 0, and cannot be invertible. Therefore, dp[0] = 0 for all test cases.

You can use dynamic programming by creating a table where each cell dp[i] represents the number of positive invertible integer matrices with trace i. The transition relation can be formulated as follows:

For any i, if we have found the number of matrices with traces j and k for j < i and k < i, then we can form a matrix with trace i by adding two j-k matrices or one i-j matrix.

The recurrence relation would be: dp[i] = sum(dp[j] * dp[k] for j in range(i-2) and k in range(i-2)) + dp[i//2] (since 1 is always an invertible matrix with trace 1).

Create a table dp where dp[i] represents the number of positive invertible integer matrices with trace i.

Initialize the base cases: dp[0] = 0, dp[1] = 1

Fill in the rest of the table by iterating from i=2 to N and calculating dp[i] using the recurrence relation.

Finally, return dp[N].
