===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by using a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the count of invertible matrices with trace i and determinant j.
State: (trace_value, determinant_value), Transition:
For each new trace value t from 1 to N, consider all possible pairs of values a and b such that t = a + b. 
Update the counts for the corresponding trace values in dp[][] by summing up the counts for the trace values a and b.
Base case: Initialize dp[0][0] as 1 (the count of invertible matrices with trace 0 and determinant 0), dp[i][j] as 0 for i > N or j < 0, 
dp[1][1] as 2 (the count of invertible matrices with trace 1 and determinant 1) and dp[1][0] as 2.
The final answer is the sum of counts for all possible trace values from 1 to N where the determinant is positive.
