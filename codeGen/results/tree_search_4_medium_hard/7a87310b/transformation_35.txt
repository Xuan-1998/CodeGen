===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider a bottom-up approach with tabulation, as this problem has an optimal substructure.

The base case is when the trace is 1, in which case there is only one possible matrix (the identity matrix). We can initialize dp[1] = 1.

The recurrence relation can be formulated as follows: for any i > 1, if we have found the number of matrices with traces j and k for j < i and k < i, then we can form a matrix with trace i by adding two j-k matrices or one i-j matrix. Specifically:

* dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[j] * dp[k] (for all 0 <= j < i and 0 <= k < i)
* dp[i] = dp[i-2] (since we can form a matrix with trace i by adding two matrices with traces 1)

Use memoization to store and reuse intermediate results, which can be used to avoid redundant computations. This can be achieved by using a dictionary to store the values of dp[i].

Edge cases:

* N = 0 or N < 3: return 0 (since there are no possible matrices)
* i > 25: use memoization to avoid computing values that have already been computed
