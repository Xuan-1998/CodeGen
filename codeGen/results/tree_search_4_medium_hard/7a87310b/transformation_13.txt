===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by counting the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N, and then selecting the ones with positive determinant.

The state can be defined as just the trace value itself, since the problem only cares about counting the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N. The base case would be the count of invertible matrices when the trace is 0 or 1, which is relatively easy to calculate.

State: (trace_value,), Transition:
For each new trace value t, consider all possible pairs of values a and b such that t = a + b, and update the count for the corresponding trace value.

To make the plan more concrete, we can define a dynamic programming table dp where dp[i] represents the number of invertible matrices with trace i. The base case would be dp[0], which is 1 (the identity matrix), and dp[1], which is 2 (the two possible matrices with trace 1).

For larger trace values, we can recursively build up the counts by considering all possible pairs of values a and b such that t = a + b. This is equivalent to saying that an invertible matrix with trace t exists if and only if there exist invertible matrices with traces a and b such that t = a + b.

We can implement tabulation using a bottom-up approach, starting from the base case (counting invertible matrices when the trace is 0 or 1) and recursively building up the counts for larger trace values. The final answer would be dp[N], which represents the number of invertible matrices with trace N and positive determinant.
