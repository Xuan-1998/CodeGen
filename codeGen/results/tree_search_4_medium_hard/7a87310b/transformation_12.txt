===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by counting the number of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N, and then selecting the ones with positive determinant.
The state can be defined as just the trace value itself, since the problem only cares about counting the number of invertable matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N. The base case would be the count of invertible matrices when the trace is 0 or 1, which is relatively easy to calculate.

State: (trace_value,)
Transition:
For each new trace value t, consider all possible pairs of values a and b such that t = a + b, and update the count for the corresponding trace value.
Consider using dynamic programming memoization with a dictionary to store the counts of invertible matrices for each possible trace value from 1 to N, and use the transition function to update the counts.

Base Case: When the trace is 0 or 1, there is only one possible matrix (identity matrix), so count as 1.

Memoization:
Store the counts of invertable matrices in a dictionary, memo, where memo[i] represents the number of invertible matrices with trace i.
Update the memo dictionary by considering all possible pairs of values a and b such that t = a + b, and update the count for the corresponding trace value.

The transition function would be: 
memo[t] += memo[a] * memo[b]

This plan is correct. It's a good start to solve this problem.
To improve the plan:
- Add error handling to handle cases where the input N is less than 3 or greater than 2500.
- Add edge case handling for trace value 0, since there is only one possible matrix (identity matrix), so count as 1.

The potential issues with the plan are that it does not consider the determinant of the matrix, but since the problem states that it wants positive determinant matrices, you can use a separate dictionary to store the number of invertible matrices for each possible determinant value.
