===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

A 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to fill a table of size i x j such that the sum of elements in the ith row is not less than the sum of elements in the (i-1)th row.

dp[i][0] = 1, because there's only one way to fill a table with M columns and no rows: using zeros.
For 0 ≤ k < i:
    dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to fill a table of size i x j such that each row sums up to s where 0 ≤ s ≤ M.
    dp[i][j] = Σ(dp[k][M-1-k]) for 0 ≤ k < i.

Memoization using a 2D array dp: Initialize a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to fill a table of size i x j, and update the values based on the recurrence relation.

For each row i from 1 to N:
    For each column j from 0 to M-1:
        If j < M/2, calculate the number of ways to fill a table of size i x j such that each row sums up to s where 0 ≤ s ≤ M.
        Else, calculate the number of ways to fill a table of size i x (M-j) such that each row sums up to s where 0 ≤ s ≤ M.

Finally, return dp[N][M] as the result.
