===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the number of ways to fill a table with a given sum in each row. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

A 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to fill a table of size i x j such that:
1. The ith row sums up to s where 0 ≤ s ≤ M.
2. dp[i][j] = Σ(dp[k][M-k-1]) for 0 ≤ k < i.

The base case is when i == N and j == M, in which case the number of ways to fill the table is either 0 or 1 (depending on whether the sums are valid).

Memoize a recursive function that calculates dp[i][j] based on the values of dp[k][M-k-1]. This ensures that we don't recalculate the same subproblem multiple times.

To avoid redundant calculations, consider pruning the recursion tree by only exploring the subtrees where the sums in each row are valid.

The plan includes edge cases when i == N and j == M, but it may not account for cases where N or M is 0.
