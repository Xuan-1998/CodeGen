===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

Let's define a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to fill a table of size i x j such that the sum of elements in the ith row is not less than the sum of elements in the (i-1)th row, and the total sum of the ith row does not exceed M.

The base case for the dynamic programming would be dp[0][j] = 1, which means there's only one way to fill a table of size 0 x j, since all the sums are zero.

For the recursive case, we can consider the last element in the ith row. If it's r, then the sum of the ith row would be equal to the sum of the (i-1)th row plus r. This means that for each possible value of r from 0 to M, we need to count the number of ways to fill a table of size i-1 x j such that the total sum of the (i-1)th row does not exceed M-r.

So, dp[i][j] = Σ(dp[k][M-k-1]) for 0 ≤ k < i. This recursive case can be memoized using a dictionary to store the intermediate results for faster computation.

To avoid counting duplicate ways to fill the table, we can sort the rows by their sums before filling the table, and then use the sorted rows to construct all possible steady tables.
