===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider solving smaller subproblems first and combining them to solve larger problems. This could involve building up from base cases.

dp[i][j] = sum of all possible table configurations ending at cell (i, j), where i ranges from 0 to N-1 and j ranges from 0 to M-1.
dp[i][j] represents a table configuration with i rows and j columns, and the state transition can be formulated based on dp[i-1][j] and the difference between sums of adjacent rows.

To handle edge cases:
- Initialize base case for dp[0][j], which would represent an empty table configuration.
- When computing dp[i][j], ensure that i >= 1 and j >= 1, as we need at least one row and column to make a valid configuration.

Memoization can be used to store previously computed results in a dictionary and reuse them when needed. This will help reduce the time complexity by avoiding redundant computations.

To improve the plan:
- Consider using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where you start with base cases (dp[0][j]) and build up to solve larger problems.
- Ensure that the state transition is correct, taking into account the constraints of the problem (sums of adjacent rows).
- Use memoization effectively by storing results in a dictionary and reusing them when needed.
