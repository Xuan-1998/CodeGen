===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with bottom-up approach and memoization.

A 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to fill a table of size i x j such that the sum of elements in the ith row is not less than the sum of elements in the (i-1)th row.
dp[i][j] = Σ(dp[k][M-k-1]) for 0 ≤ k < i and dp[0][s] = 1 for 0 ≤ s ≤ M.

Fill the dp array by iterating over all possible values of i from 1 to N, j from 1 to M, and s from 0 to M.
For each cell dp[i][j], calculate its value based on previously calculated values using the recurrence relation.

Finally, return dp[N][M] as the result.
