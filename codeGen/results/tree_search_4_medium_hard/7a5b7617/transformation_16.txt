===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

The state is a set of rows, where each row is represented as a list of integers and the base case is when all rows are filled.
If n_rows == N or n_rows >= M, then return 1 because we can't make a larger table.

Create a memoization function with a dictionary to store the intermediate results and update it recursively.

For each row in the current state:
    Calculate the possible sums for this row by summing all possible combinations of elements from previous rows.
    For each possible sum, check if it's less than M. If not, skip this sum.
    Recursively calculate the number of ways to fill the remaining table (n_rows + 1) and add it to the total count.

Return the total count modulo 1 000 000 000.
