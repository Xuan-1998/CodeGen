===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has overlapping subproblems, which can be solved by using a bottom-up approach with tabulation.

Consider the number of steady tables ending at each cell as the state, where the base case is when all cells are filled with non-negative integers.

Let the state be a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to fill the top i rows and j columns with non-negative integers such that the sums of elements in each row are monotonically increasing. Then, the state transitions can be formulated as follows: if cell (i, j) is filled with k, then the possible states for the top-left and top-right cells are dp[i-1][j-k] and dp[i-1][j].

To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can use two nested loops to build up a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to fill the top i rows and j columns with non-negative integers such that the sums of elements in each row are monotonically increasing.

The base case is when all cells are filled with non-negative integers, which means we only need to consider the sum of elements in each row. This can be solved by using a simple recursive function.

Then, for each cell (i, j), we can calculate dp[i][j] as the sum of dp[i-1][j-k] and dp[i-1][j] where k is the possible number to fill the cell.

Finally, return dp[N][M] as the result, which represents the total number of different steady tables of size N x M modulo 1 000 000 000.
