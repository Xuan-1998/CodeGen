===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with bottom-up approach and memoization.

The state is a pair (n_rows, prev_row_sum) where n_rows is the number of rows filled so far and prev_row_sum is the sum of elements in the previous row. The base case is when all rows are filled (n_rows = N).

If prev_row_sum > M and n_rows < N, then there is one way to fill the sub-table: all rows have sums equal to M, so add to memoized values.

The dynamic programming table dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to fill a sub-table of size i x j. Initialize dp[0][j] = 1 for all j because there is one way to fill an empty table (i.e., by not filling it at all).

For each cell dp[i][j], consider two cases:

* If prev_row_sum <= M, then we have a choice of either adding 0 or any number up to M in the current row. So, update dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + (M - prev_row_sum + 1) for each possible value of the current row sum.
* If prev_row_sum > M, then we have only one way to fill the sub-table: all rows have sums equal to M. So, update dp[i][j] = 1.

Finally, return dp[N-1][M-1] as the result.
