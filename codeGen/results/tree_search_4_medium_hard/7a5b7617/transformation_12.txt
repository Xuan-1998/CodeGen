===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

The state is a set of rows, where each row is represented as a list of integers, and the base case is when all rows are filled.
If n_rows == N or prev_row_sum >= M, then return 1 because we can't make a larger table.
Implement memoization with a recursive function that stores the results of subproblems in a dictionary as it solves them.

The key insight is to notice that the problem allows for empty cells (represented by zeros), which means we can "steal" values from previous rows. This property can be exploited to reduce the number of possible states and speed up the computation.
To improve the plan, consider using bottom-up dynamic programming instead of top-down, as it might be more efficient.

Potential issues with the plan include:
- Edge cases: What happens when N or M is 0?
- Handling zeros in the table (since they can "steal" values from previous rows)
- Memoization could be tricky to implement correctly
