===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by dynamic programming with memoization.
Let's define the state dp[i][j] as the number of different steady tables of size i x j, where 1 ≤ i ≤ N and 1 ≤ j ≤ M.

Base case: When i = 1 (i.e., there is only one row), we have dp[1][j] = 1 for all 1 ≤ j ≤ M, since we can create a steady table with any sum of elements in the first row.

Transition relationship: For i > 1 and 1 ≤ j ≤ M, consider two cases:

- If the sum of elements in the ith row is less than or equal to j, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][sum - (j - 1)] + dp[i-1][j], where sum is the sum of elements in the first i-1 rows.
- If the sum of elements in the ith row is greater than j, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j].

To avoid redundant calculations, use a hash map or dictionary to store the previously calculated values.
