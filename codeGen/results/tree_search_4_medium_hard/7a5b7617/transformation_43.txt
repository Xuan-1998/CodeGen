===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider solving smaller subproblems first and combining them to solve larger problems. This could involve building up from base cases.

dp[i][j] = number of ways to fill the current cell with a non-negative integer such that the sums of elements in rows up to i are all less than or equal to M.

DP by constructing smaller subproblems and combining them

1. Initialize dp[0][0] to 1 (base case: only one way to fill an empty table)
2. Fill dp[i][j] for increasing i:
   - For each j, calculate the number of ways to fill the current cell (dp[i][j]) considering all possible sums up to i
   - Combine these possibilities with previous rows' possibilities to get the total count
3. Return dp[N-1][M-1]
