===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach and memoization.

Let dp[i][j] represent the number of different steady tables that have i rows and j columns.
The state is a set of rows, where each row is represented as a list of integers and the base case is when all rows are filled.

For the first row, there is only one way to fill it (all elements equal to 0), so dp[1][j] = 1 for all j.
For each subsequent row k (2 ≤ k ≤ N):
	* If prev_row_sum > M and n_rows < N, then there are two ways to fill the sub-table: either keep the previous sums or reset them. So add to memoized values.
	* Otherwise, if prev_row_sum <= M, then we can only keep the previous sums.

The hybrid approach is not necessary as the problem can be solved in a bottom-up manner.

Edge cases are considered:
	* N = 1: There's only one way to fill it (all elements equal to 0).
	* M = 1: There's only one way to fill it (all elements equal to 0).
