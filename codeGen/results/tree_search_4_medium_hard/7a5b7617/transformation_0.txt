===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

Let's define the state as a tuple (i, s) representing the number of different steady tables of size i x j where each row sums up to s. The initial state would be (1, 0), and the final state is (N, M).

The transition relationship can be described as follows:
- If i = 1, then there is only one way to fill the table, which is an empty table.
- For i > 1, consider filling the ith row with k elements, where k is a non-negative integer. The number of ways to fill the (i-1)th and (i+1)th rows are dp[i-1][s-k] and dp[i-2][s], respectively.

The base case would be when i = 1, in which case there is only one way to fill the table.

We can use a 2D array to store the dynamic programming table, where the state is represented as (i, s) and the value at that state represents the number of different steady tables of size i x j with each row summing up to s.

The final answer would be dp[N][M], which gives the total number of different steady tables of size N x M.
