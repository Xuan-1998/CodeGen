===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider solving smaller subproblems first and combining them to solve larger problems. This could involve building up from base cases.

dp[i][j] = number of ways to fill the current cell with a non-negative integer such that the sums of elements in rows up to i are all less than or equal to M.
This is a correct approach as it reduces the problem size by considering the cumulative sum and memoization helps avoid redundant calculations.

Memoization using a dictionary to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
This is also a good approach as it avoids calculating the same subproblem multiple times, which can significantly speed up the solution.

The plan seems correct but here's an updated version with some minor improvements:
