===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] = number of ways to fill the current cell with a non-negative integer such that the sums of elements in rows up to i are all less than or equal to M.

1. Initialize base cases:
   dp[0][j] = 1 (only one way to fill the first row)
   dp[i][0] = 1 (only one way to fill the first column)

2. Tabulate solutions for overlapping subproblems:
   dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][j-1] * (M - sum(dp[k][j-1]) for k in range(i)) for j in range(1, M))

3. Use tabulated solutions to solve larger problems:
   result = sum(dp[N-1][j] for j in range(M))
