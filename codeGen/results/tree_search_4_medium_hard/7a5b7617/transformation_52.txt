===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has overlapping subproblems, which can be solved by using a bottom-up approach with tabulation.

Consider the number of steady tables ending at each cell as the state, where the base case is when all cells are filled with non-negative integers. Let the state be a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to fill the first i rows with non-negative integers such that the sums of elements in each row are monotonically increasing.

Then, the state transitions can be formulated as follows: if cell (i, j) is filled with k, then the possible states for the top-left and top-right cells are dp[i-1][j-k] and dp[i-1][j]. This is because we need to ensure that the sum of elements in each row is monotonically increasing.

The DP solution can be implemented by initializing a 2D array with zeros, where dp[0][j] represents the number of ways to fill the first 0 rows (i.e., an empty table) with non-negative integers. The base case can be formulated as dp[i][0] = 1 for all i, since there is always one way to fill an empty table.

The recurrence relation can be written as follows: 
dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(0, j+1)) % 1000000007

This is because we need to consider all possible values of the current cell (i.e., 0 to j) and ensure that the sums of elements in each row are monotonically increasing.

Finally, the answer can be calculated as dp[N][M] modulo 1000000007.
