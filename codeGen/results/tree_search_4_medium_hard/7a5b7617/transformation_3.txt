===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

The state is a tuple (i, j) representing the number of different steady tables of size i x j.
Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach: The state could be a tuple (i, j) representing the number of different steady tables of size i x j. In this approach, the transition relationship would involve calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table of size i-1 x j and ensuring that the sums in each row are non-decreasing.

The transition relation for filling a table of size (i, j) could be:

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][j - 1] * (1 + k) for k in range(i)) % 1000000000

This function call considers all possible ways to fill the last row and calculates the total number of different steady tables. The result is then stored in the memoization table.

The base case could be when i = 0 or j = 0, where dp[0][j] = 1 for all j and dp[i][0] = 0 for all i.

Recursive function calls with memoization to store the intermediate results.

Finally, the answer would be dp[N][M].
