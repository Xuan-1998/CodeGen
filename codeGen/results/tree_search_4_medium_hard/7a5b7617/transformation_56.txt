===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization.
Consider the sum of elements in each row as a state, and define a base case where the sums of all rows except the first one are equal to or greater than 1.
Let dp[i][j] represent the number of steady tables that can be formed given a particular sum for each row i, with j elements in the ith row.
Use memoization with a dictionary to store the number of steady tables for each possible sum of elements in a row, and update the table based on previously computed values.

The plan is as follows:

1. dp[0][j] = 1, because there's only one way to form a steady table with j elements in the first row (i.e., all j elements are equal).

2. For i > 0, calculate dp[i][j] by considering two cases:
   - The sum of elements in the ith row is less than or equal to j: In this case, we can choose any number of elements from 0 to j for the ith row, and recursively compute the number of steady tables that can be formed with the remaining rows.
   - The sum of elements in the ith row is greater than j: In this case, there's no way to form a steady table with the given sums.

3. Use memoization to store the computed values of dp[i][j] and update the table based on previously computed values.

4. Finally, calculate the total number of different steady tables by summing up the values in dp[N-1][] modulo 1 000 000 000.
