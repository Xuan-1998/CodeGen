===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with bottom-up approach and 2D table.

The state is a 2D table dp[][] where dp[i][j] represents the number of different steady tables of size i x j.
The base case is when all rows are filled (i.e., N = n_rows).

For each cell dp[i][j], there are two possible ways to fill the (i, j)th cell:

1. The last row sum is less than or equal to M and we can choose a new row sum from 0 to M.
2. The last row sum is greater than M and we need to reduce the current row sum by some amount to make it less than or equal to M.

For each of these cases, we recursively calculate the number of different steady tables for the sub-problem (i-1) x j and add the number of ways to choose a new row sum from 0 to M.

To avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency, we use memoization by storing the results in the dp[][] table as we fill it up.

Finally, we return the value at cell dp[N][M] which represents the total number of different steady tables of size N x M modulo 1 000 000 000.
