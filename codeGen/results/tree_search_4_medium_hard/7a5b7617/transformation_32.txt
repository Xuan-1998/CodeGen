===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider solving smaller subproblems first and combining them to solve larger problems. This could involve building up from base cases.

dp[i][j] = sum of all possible table configurations ending at cell (i, j), where i ranges from 0 to N-1 and j ranges from 0 to M-1.
dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to fill a table with sum i in the jth column, and dp[i][k] is updated based on dp[i-1][0:k].
Memoization by precomputing solutions to smaller subproblems and storing them in a dictionary for reuse.

Initialize a 2D array dp with size (N+1) * (M+1) filled with zeros.
For each cell dp[i][j], calculate the number of possible table configurations ending at cell (i, j).
If i == N, then only one possibility exists: all cells in the last row are zero. 
Else, consider two cases:
    1. The current cell is not part of any sum: update dp[i][j] with the product of the number of ways to fill the table above and the number of possible configurations for the current cell.
    2. The current cell is part of a sum: update dp[i][j] by iterating over all possible sums up to i, considering which cells in the current row should be included in the sum, and then multiplying with the number of ways to fill the table above.

Finally, return dp[N][M].
