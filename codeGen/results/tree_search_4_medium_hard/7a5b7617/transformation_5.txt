===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

The state is a tuple (n_rows, prev_row_sum), where n_rows is the number of rows filled and prev_row_sum is the sum of the last row. The base case is when all rows are filled (n_rows == N).

If prev_row_sum is less than or equal to M and n_rows < N, then there are min(M, prev_row_sum + 1) ways to choose next row sum, and recursively call with updated state (n_rows + 1, new_row_sum).

To use a recursive function with memoization to store and reuse previously computed results. Memoize the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computation.

The final answer is the value stored in the memoization table for the initial state (0, 0).
