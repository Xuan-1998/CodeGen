===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] = number of ways to fill the current cell with a non-negative integer such that 
  - The sums of elements in rows up to i are all less than or equal to M.
  - The sums of elements in rows up to (i-1) are strictly less than the sum of elements in the ith row.

dp[0][j] = number of ways to fill a single cell with non-negative integers such that 
  - The sum of the cell is less than or equal to M.
  - The sum of the cell is strictly less than M.

For i > 0, dp[i][j] can be calculated as the sum of dp[i-1][k] over all k such that:
  - k <= j
  - sum of elements in rows up to (i-1) + k is less than or equal to M
  - sum of elements in rows up to (i-1) + k is strictly less than the sum of elements in the ith row

Memoize function calls to avoid redundant computations.
