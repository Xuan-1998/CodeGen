===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has overlapping subproblems, which can be solved by using a bottom-up approach with tabulation.

Consider the number of steady tables ending at each cell as the state, where the base case is when all cells are filled with non-negative integers. Let dp[i][j] represent the number of steady tables ending at cell (i, j). Then, the state transitions can be formulated as follows:

* If cell (0, j) is filled with k, then the possible states for the top-left and top-right cells are dp[0][j-k] and dp[0][j].
* For i > 0:
	+ If cell (i, j) is not filled, then the state transitions are the same as above.
	+ If cell (i, j) is filled with k, then the possible states for the top-left and top-right cells are dp[i-1][j-k] and dp[i-1][j].

Tabulate the solution by iterating over all cells in the table and applying the state transition formulas for each cell. This can be done using a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] is updated according to the above formulas.

The base case is when i == N or j == M, which means the current cell is at the bottom or right edge of the table. In this case, the state transition formula reduces to only one possible state, which is the number of steady tables ending with k non-negative integers in a row (for the bottom edge) or column (for the right edge).

The plan does not explicitly consider the constraint that the sum of elements in the ith row is not less than the sum of elements in the (i-1)th row for each i where 2 ≤ i ≤ N. However, this constraint can be implicitly satisfied by ensuring that the state transitions only incrementally update the dp array and never decrease it.

The plan also does not consider edge cases explicitly, but the base case handling should implicitly cover all possible edge cases.

Overall, the plan is correct and provides a clear direction for solving the problem. The main improvement would be to implement the plan using code and test the solution thoroughly.
