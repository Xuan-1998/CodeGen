===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

Let's define the state as a tuple (n_rows, last_sum), where n_rows is the current number of rows filled and last_sum is the sum of the previous row. The base case is when all rows are filled (n_rows == N).

To fill the next row, there are M + 1 ways to choose the sum: all possible sums from 0 to M inclusive. This can be represented as a dictionary dp[n_rows][last_sum] = number_of_ways.

The recurrence relation would be:

- If n_rows < N, then there are M + 1 ways to choose the sum for next row and recursively call with updated state (n_rows + 1).

Using a dictionary to store memoized results: dp = {i: {} for i in range(N+1)}

The final answer is dp[N][0].

This plan seems correct, as it uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
