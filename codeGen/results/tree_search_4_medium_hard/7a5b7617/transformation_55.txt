===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has overlapping subproblems, which can be solved by using a bottom-up approach with tabulation.

Let's define a state based on the sum of elements in each row. Let dp[i][j] denote the number of different steady tables that can be formed given the sums of the first i rows are j and the total number of columns is M.

The base case is when the sums of all rows except the first one are equal to or greater than 1, which means we need to consider only the cases where the sum of the first row is less than M.

Now, let's think about how to fill up the dp table. For each i and j, there are two possible ways to form a steady table: either add 0 to all elements in the ith row (dp[i-1][j] possibilities) or add M to all elements in the ith row (M * dp[i-1][j-M] possibilities).

So, we have:

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + (M * dp[i-1][j-M]) % 1000000000

Finally, the answer is simply the sum of all values in the last row of the dp table.
