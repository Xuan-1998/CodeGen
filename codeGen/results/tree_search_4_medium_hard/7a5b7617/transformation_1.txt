===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the last row of a steady table. For each possible sum for the last row, calculate the number of different steady tables of size (i-1) x M that have sums not less than this value in each row.

Let's define dp[i][j] as the number of different steady tables of size i x j. Then:

dp[i][0] = 1 (base case: an empty table has one way to be filled)

For j > 0, calculate:

- Let s be the sum of the last row.
- Let w be the number of different steady tables of size (i-1) x M that have sums not less than s in each row.

dp[i][j] = Σ(w | 0 ≤ s ≤ j)

The state is a tuple (i, j), representing the number of different steady tables of size i x j.
Use memoization to store and reuse the intermediate results.

Dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach, using tabulation to store the intermediate results.
