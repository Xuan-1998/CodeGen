===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has overlapping subproblems, which can be solved by using a top-down approach with memoization instead of dynamic programming.

State: The number of different steady tables of size (i, j) where i is the current row and j is the current column. This state represents the sum of elements in the ith row.

Create a 2D array to store the memoized states with dimensions (N+1) x (M+1), where each cell dp[i][j] represents the number of different steady tables of size i x j.
For each cell, calculate the value by iterating over all possible sums from 0 to M and checking if the sum is less than or equal to the sum of elements in the ith row. If it is, increment the count for that sum.

Base case: The number of different steady tables of size (1, j) where j is the current column is simply 1, since there's only one way to fill a single element.
Recurrence relation:
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][0] + sum(sum(dp[k][j-k+1]) for k in range(j))
This recurrence relation represents the number of different steady tables of size i x j by considering all possible sums from 0 to M and checking if the sum is less than or equal to the sum of elements in the ith row.

Return dp[N][M] as the result, which represents the total number of different steady tables of size N x M modulo 1 000 000 000.
