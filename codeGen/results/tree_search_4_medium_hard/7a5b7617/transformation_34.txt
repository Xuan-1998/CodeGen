===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider solving smaller subproblems first and combining them to solve larger problems. This could involve building up from base cases.

dp[i][j] = sum of all possible table configurations ending at cell (i, j), where i ranges from 0 to N-1 and j ranges from 0 to M-1.
dp[i][j] is 1 if the ith row sum is at most M-j, otherwise it's dp[i-1][M-j-1].

The base cases are when i = 0 or j = 0. For these cases, we can set dp[0][j] = 1 and dp[i][0] = 1.

For the recursive case, we can use the following transition function:

dp[i][j] = (sum of all possible configurations for cell (i-1, M-j-1) + 1) if the ith row sum is at most M-j
      else dp[i-1][M-j-1]

We can fill up the dp table from the base cases to the final solution.
