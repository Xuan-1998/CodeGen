===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering the last row of the table. The number of ways to fill a table of size i x j is equal to the sum of the number of ways to fill a table of size (i-1) x k for all 0 ≤ k < j, as long as the sum of elements in the ith row is not less than the sum of elements in the (i-1)th row.

A 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to fill a table of size i x j such that the sum of elements in the ith row is not less than the sum of elements in the (i-1)th row, and dp[i][j] = Σ(dp[k][M-k]) for 0 ≤ k < i.

We can use memoization to store intermediate results. We can also use a dictionary to store the values of dp[i][j] as we calculate them, and return the value of dp[N][M] as the final result.

To avoid counting duplicate solutions, we need to consider the sum of elements in each row from left to right. This means that if the ith row has a sum s, then the (i-1)th row must also have a sum less than or equal to s.

The time complexity is O(N*M), where N and M are the number of rows and columns respectively. The space complexity is O(N*M) as well, for storing the dp array.
