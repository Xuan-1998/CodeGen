===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has overlapping subproblems, which can be solved by using a bottom-up approach with tabulation.

Consider the number of steady tables ending at each cell as the state, where the base case is when all cells are filled with non-negative integers.

Let the state be a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of steady tables ending at cell (i, j). Then, the state transitions can be formulated as follows: if cell (i, j) is filled with k, then the possible states for the top-left and top-right cells are dp[i-1][j-k] and dp[i-1][j].

However, this plan does not take into account the constraint that the sum of elements in the ith row should be not less than the sum of elements in the (i-1)th row. This needs to be incorporated into the state transitions.

To do this, we can maintain a separate 2D array rs[i][j] where rs[i][j] represents the remaining space in the ith row after filling cell (i, j). Then, the state transitions can be modified as follows: if cell (i, j) is filled with k, then the possible states for the top-left and top-right cells are dp[i-1][j-k] and dp[i-1][j], and the remaining space in the ith row becomes rs[i-1][j-k] and rs[i-1][j].

Implement memoization using a dictionary to store and reuse the results of subproblems.

Finally, for each cell (i, j), calculate the number of steady tables ending at this cell by summing up the possible states from top-left and top-right cells. If there is no remaining space in the ith row, set rs[i][j] = M.
