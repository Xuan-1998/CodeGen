===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider solving smaller subproblems first and combining them to solve larger problems. This could involve building up from base cases.

Let's define dp[i][j] as the number of possible table configurations ending at cell (i, j), where i ranges from 0 to N-1 and j ranges from 0 to M-1.
dp[0][j] = 1 for all j, since there is only one way to configure an empty row.

The transition function can be formulated as:
dp[i][j] = (sum of possible configurations for the (i-1)th row that sum up to at most M-j) * (number of possible elements in the ith row)
This can be calculated recursively by iterating over all possible sums of the (i-1)th row, and then calculating the number of possible elements in the ith row given that sum.

Implementing memoization by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again. This will help avoid redundant calculations and improve performance.

Finally, the answer is dp[N-1][M], which represents the total number of possible table configurations.
