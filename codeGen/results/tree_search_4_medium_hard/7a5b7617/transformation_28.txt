===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

A 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to fill a table of size i x j such that the sum of elements in the ith row is not less than the sum of elements in the (i-1)th row. However, this approach does not take into account the constraint that the sum of elements in the Nth row is less than or equal to M.

A more accurate representation would be a 3D array dp[i][j][k] where dp[i][j][k] represents the number of ways to fill a table of size i x j with non-negative integers such that each row sums up to k and k ≤ M. This allows us to track the constraint on the sum of elements in the Nth row.

dp[i][j][k] = Σ(dp[k-1][M-k]) for 0 < k ≤ M

Dynamic programming with memoization: Create a recursive function that calculates the number of ways to fill a table and store the results in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations. This can be done by using a hashmap to store the intermediate results.
