===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

The state is a tuple (n_rows, prev_row_sum), where n_rows represents the number of rows remaining to be filled, and prev_row_sum is the sum of elements in the previous row. The base case is when all rows are filled (n_rows == 0).

Create a recursive function dp(n_rows, prev_row_sum) with memoization to store the number of ways to fill a sub-table. The function should return the number of different steady tables of size n_rows x M.

The recursive formula can be written as:
- If n_rows == N or prev_row_sum >= M, then return 1 because we can't make a larger table.
- For each possible sum s in range [0, M], if s <= M and prev_row_sum + s <= M, add dp(n_rows - 1, prev_row_sum + s) to the result.

The function should be initialized with a dictionary memo = {} as the memoization cache.

The final answer can be calculated by calling dp(N, 0).
