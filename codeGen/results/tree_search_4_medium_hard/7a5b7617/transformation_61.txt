===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has overlapping subproblems, which can be solved by using a bottom-up approach with tabulation.

We will define a state based on the sum of elements in each row and use this information to solve the problem. The base case is when the sums of all rows except the first one are equal to or greater than 1.

The dynamic programming approach could start by initializing a table where each cell [i][j] represents the number of different steady tables that can be formed with i rows and j columns modulo 1 000 000 000.

Define a dynamic programming table dp[][] where dp[i][j] represents the number of different steady tables that can be formed with i rows and j columns.

The base case is when i = 1, meaning we are only considering one row. In this case, there is only one way to form a steady table with one row (i.e., all elements in the row are 0). So dp[1][j] = 1 for all j.

For the recursive step, consider the sum of elements in each row. If we know the number of different steady tables that can be formed with i-1 rows and j columns, and the sum of elements in the ith row is greater than or equal to the sum of elements in the (i-1)th row, then we can add all possible ways to fill the ith row without exceeding its sum.

On the other hand, if the sum of elements in the ith row is less than the sum of elements in the (i-1)th row, then we cannot form a steady table with i rows and j columns. In this case, dp[i][j] = 0.

Finally, for the modulo operation, take the result of each cell and apply the modulo operation to ensure the result is within the required range.
