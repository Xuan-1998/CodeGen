===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has overlapping subproblems, which can be solved by using a bottom-up approach with tabulation.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = number of ways to fill the current row such that the sum is less than or equal to M minus the sum of previous rows. This is because we want to count the number of ways to fill the table, not just the sums in each row.

To tabulate this, we can use a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to fill the last i columns and the sum of elements in those columns is less than or equal to j. We start by initializing dp[0][k] = 1 for all k, since there's only one way to fill an empty table.

Then, we can use a recursive formula: dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k]) for k in range(j+1), since the number of ways to fill the current row is the sum of the number of ways to fill previous rows such that their sums are less than or equal to j minus the sum of elements in the current row.

Finally, we can return dp[N][M] as our answer, which represents the total number of ways to fill the table.
