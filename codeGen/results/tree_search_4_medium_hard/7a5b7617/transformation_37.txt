===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider solving smaller subproblems first and combining them to solve larger problems. This could involve building up from base cases.

dp[i][j] = sum of all possible table configurations ending at cell (i, j), where i ranges from 0 to N-1 and j ranges from 0 to M-1.
dp[i][j] represents a table configuration with i rows and j columns, and the state transition can be formulated based on dp[i-1][j] and the difference between sums of adjacent rows.

Create a bottom-up dynamic programming solution by filling up the dp table from scratch.

For each cell (i, j), consider two possible configurations: either the current row has more elements than the previous row, or it doesn't. This can be modeled as a binary choice problem.
Let's use 0 to represent the case where the current row has less or equal elements compared to the previous one, and 1 for the case where it has more.
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + (i > 1) * (sum of adjacent rows difference is positive)
The state transition can be formulated based on the above choices.

Fill up the dp table in a bottom-up manner, starting from the base cases: dp[0][j] for all j and dp[i][0] for all i.
Finally, return dp[N-1][M-1] as the result, which represents the number of different steady tables.
