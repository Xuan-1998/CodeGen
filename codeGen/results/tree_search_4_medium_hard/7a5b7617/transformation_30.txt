The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

A 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to fill a table of size i x j such that the sum of elements in the ith row is not less than the sum of elements in the (i-1)th row, considering all possible sums for each row.

dp[i][j] = Σ(dp[k][M-k-1]) for 0 ≤ k < i and 0 ≤ s ≤ M where dp[0][s] is equal to 1 for 0 ≤ s ≤ M

A top-down dynamic programming approach: Start with the base case for small tables (e.g., 1xM) and recursively calculate the number of ways to fill larger tables by considering all possible sums for each row.

dp[0][s] = 1 if 0 ≤ s ≤ M
dp[i][j] = Σ(dp[k][M-k-1]) for 0 ≤ k < i and dp[i-1][s-i+1] for 0 ≤ s ≤ M

The base case is dp[0][s] = 1 for 0 ≤ s ≤ M, since there's only one way to fill a table of size 0xM.

Recursively calculate the number of ways to fill larger tables by considering all possible sums for each row. For example, dp[i][j] can be calculated as Σ(dp[k][M-k-1]) for 0 ≤ k < i and dp[i-1][s-i+1] for 0 ≤ s ≤ M.
