===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider solving smaller subproblems first and combining them to solve larger problems. This could involve building up from base cases.

dp[i][j] = sum of all possible table configurations ending at cell (i, j), where i ranges from 0 to N-1 and j ranges from 0 to M-1.
dp[i][j] represents a table configuration with i rows and j columns, and the state transition can be formulated based on dp[i-1][j] and the difference between sums of adjacent rows.

Design a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming instead of recursion with memorization. This is because the problem size constraint is small (2^20), making memoized recursion less efficient than a straightforward iterative solution.

dp[i][j] = (sum of all possible table configurations ending at cell (i-1, j) + (M - sum of previous row)) % 1000000000, where i ranges from 1 to N and j ranges from 0 to M-1.
The base case is dp[0][j] = j for each column j.

Calculate the total number of different steady tables by summing up dp[N-1][M-1].
