The plan is mostly correct. Here's an analysis and feedback:

===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to fill a table of size i x j such that 
the sum of elements in the ith row is not less than the sum of elements in the (i-1)th row.
dp[i][j] = Σ(dp[k][M-k]) for 0 ≤ k < i
Utilize a recursive function that stores its results in a dictionary to avoid repeated computations.

===END PLAN===
The plan is mostly correct. The idea of using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization is good. 
However, there are some potential issues with the plan:

1. The plan does not specify what the base cases for the recursive function would be. It should include a base case where i or j is 0 to avoid infinite recursion.

2. The plan does not mention how to handle edge cases such as when N or M is less than or equal to 0, or when the sum of elements in the ith row is greater than M for all i. 

Here's an updated version of the plan that addresses these issues:
