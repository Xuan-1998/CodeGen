===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

The state is a tuple (n_rows, n_cols) representing the current row count and column count.
The base case is when all rows are filled (n_rows == N) or the table size exceeds M (n_rows >= M), in which case we return 1 because we can't make a larger table.

To implement memoization, we use a recursive function with a dictionary cache that stores the results of subproblems and avoids recomputation. We initialize the cache as an empty dictionary.

The recursive function takes two parameters: n_rows and n_cols.
If n_rows == N or n_rows >= M, it returns 1 because we can't make a larger table.
Otherwise, it calculates the number of ways to fill the current sub-table by considering all possible values for the current row (from 0 to min(n_cols, M)) and recursively calling itself with the updated row count and column count.

The final result is stored in the cache before returning it.
