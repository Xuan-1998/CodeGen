===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider solving smaller subproblems first and combining them to solve larger problems. This could involve building up from base cases.

dp[i][j] = sum of all possible table configurations ending at cell (i, j), where i ranges from 0 to N-1 and j ranges from 0 to M-1.
Let's consider the base case: dp[0][j] for any j. This represents the number of steady tables with one row. Since each element in this row can be 0 or more, there are M+1 possible values for each cell. Therefore, dp[0][j] = M+1.

For the transition function, let's consider dp[i][j]. If the ith row sum is at most M-j, then we have a choice of M-j+1 numbers for the cell in this position. Otherwise, we can't put any value greater than M-(N-i) into this cell, so there are N-i possible choices.

dp[i][j] = (M-j+1) if ith row sum is at most M-j
       = dp[i-1][M-(N-i)] otherwise

Employing a hybrid approach that combines tabulation and memoization to efficiently store and reuse intermediate results.
Let's use 2D arrays to store the dynamic programming table, with rows representing the number of rows in the steady table (from 0 to N) and columns representing the remaining capacity of the M-columned row (from M to 0). We initialize dp[i][j] for i from 0 to N-1 and j from M to 0.
