===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has overlapping subproblems, which can be solved by using a bottom-up approach with tabulation.

Let dp[i][j] represent the number of different steady tables that can be formed for the first i rows and j columns. The base case is when the sums of all rows except the first one are equal to or greater than 1.

The state could represent the current sum of elements in each row, and the transition relationship would involve determining which table configurations are possible based on this sum. For example, if the sum of the first row is S, then there are S options for the first column, and similarly for subsequent rows.

We can use a 2D array to store the cumulative sums of each row. The transition relationship can be implemented as follows:

- If the current sum is less than or equal to j, then we have (j - S + 1) possible configurations for the next row.
- If the current sum is greater than j, then there are no more configurations.

The final answer would be dp[N][M], where N is the number of rows and M is the number of columns.

To improve the plan, you could consider a few things:

* How to handle edge cases? For example, what if N or M is 1?
* Are there any redundant calculations that can be avoided by using memoization or dynamic programming?
* Can we simplify the transition relationship?

Overall, your plan looks good and provides a solid foundation for solving this problem. With some refinement, it should give you a good chance of getting the correct answer.
