===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

The state is a tuple (n_rows, m_cols) where n_rows is the number of rows left to fill and m_cols is the remaining column space. The base case is when all rows are filled (n_rows == 0).

If m_cols > 0, then there are two cases:
- All previous elements in the row sum up to a value less than or equal to M: In this case, there are m_cols * (sum of all previous elements in the row) + 1 ways to choose next element.
- The sum of all previous elements in the row is greater than M: In this case, we can't fill the current row with any more elements, so the number of ways to fill the sub-table is 0.

We recursively call with updated state (n_rows - 1, m_cols) and add the result to a dictionary to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computation.

The final answer is stored in memo[(0, m_cols)] which represents the number of different steady tables of size N x M modulo 1 000 000 000.
