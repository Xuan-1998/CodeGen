The problem has overlapping subproblems, which can be solved by using a bottom-up approach with tabulation.

Consider the number of steady tables ending at each cell as the state, where the base case is when all cells are filled with non-negative integers. Let dp[i][j] represent the number of ways to fill the top i rows and j columns with non-negative integers such that the sums of elements in each row are monotonically increasing.

Then, the state transitions can be formulated as follows: if cell (i, j) is filled with k, then the possible states for the top-left and top-right cells are dp[i-1][j-k] and dp[i-1][j]. This ensures that the sums of elements in each row remain monotonically increasing.

To avoid counting the same table multiple times, we need to consider the sum of all elements in the current row. If the sum is less than j, then there are more ways to fill the cell (i, j), as we can add any non-negative integer up to j - sum of previous elements to fill this cell.

The final answer will be dp[N][M], which represents the number of different steady tables of size N x M modulo 1 000 000 000.

We need to initialize dp[0][j] = 1 for all columns, as there is one way to fill a row with no elements (i.e., all zeros). Then we can use a nested loop to fill the table in bottom-up manner.

The time complexity of this approach will be O(N * M) and space complexity will be O(N * M).
