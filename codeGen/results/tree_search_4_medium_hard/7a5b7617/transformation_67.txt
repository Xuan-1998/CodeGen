===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming with tabulation and memoization.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k]) for k in range(M-j), which represents the number of ways to fill the first i rows and last j columns such that the sum is less than or equal to M minus the sum of previous rows. 

The initial state would be dp[0][j] = 1 if sum(R[0][k]) <= M, where R[i][k] is the (i+1)th row's kth column, and 0 otherwise.

For each cell dp[i][j], we can calculate it by considering all possible sums of elements that could be in the ith row such that the total sum does not exceed M minus the sum of previous rows. This sum should also satisfy the condition that the ith row's sum is less than or equal to M minus the sum of (i-1)th row.

The memoization part would be implemented by storing the calculated values of dp[i][j] and reusing them when calculating dp[i+1][k], which reduces the time complexity from O(N*M) to O(N*M^2).

This plan handles edge cases by considering all possible sums of elements that could be in the ith row.

The potential issue with this plan is that it might still have a high time complexity if M is very large. A more efficient approach would be needed for such cases.
