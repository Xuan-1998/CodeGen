===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

A 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to fill a table of size i x j such that the sum of elements in the ith row is not less than the sum of elements in the (i-1)th row.
dp[i][j] = Σ(dp[k][M-k]) for 0 ≤ k < i

Create a 2D array dp with dimensions N+1 x (M+1).

Fill dp[0][j] for 0 ≤ j ≤ M by initializing all values to 1, since there is only one way to fill an empty table.

For each row i from 1 to N:

Fill dp[i][0] = 0 and dp[i][j] for 1 ≤ j ≤ M using the following recurrence relation:
dp[i][j] = Σ(dp[k][M-k]) for 0 ≤ k < i

Return the sum of all values in the last row (dp[N][M]) as the result.
