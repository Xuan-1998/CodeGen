===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has overlapping subproblems, which can be solved by using a bottom-up approach with tabulation and memoization.

Consider the number of steady tables ending at each cell as the state, where the base case is when all cells are filled with non-negative integers.

Let the state be a 3D array dp[i][j][k] where dp[i][j][k] represents the number of ways to fill the top i rows, j columns, and sum k in the last row such that the sums of elements in each row are monotonically increasing. Then, the state transitions can be formulated as follows: if cell (i, j) is filled with value v where 0 ≤ v ≤ M and the sum of elements in the ith row is less than or equal to k, then the possible states for the top-left and top-right cells are dp[i-1][j-v][k-v] and dp[i-1][j][k].

Create a memo dictionary where the key is a tuple representing the state of the table (i.e., the sum of elements in each row) and the value is the number of ways to fill the table up to that state.

Initialize the memo dictionary with base cases for empty tables and single-row tables. Then, iterate over all possible values v from 0 to M and update the memo dictionary accordingly.

Finally, return the value of dp[N][M][sum(N*M)] as the result.
