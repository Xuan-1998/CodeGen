===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

The state is a tuple (n_rows, prev_row_sum) where n_rows represents the number of rows left to fill and prev_row_sum represents the sum of the previous row. The base case is when all rows are filled (n_rows == 0).

For each subproblem, we can calculate the number of ways to fill it by iterating over the possible values for the current row and recursively solving smaller subproblems.

The state transition function can be defined as follows:
- If n_rows > N or prev_row_sum >= M, return 1 because we can't make a larger table.
- Otherwise, iterate over all possible values for the current row and calculate the number of ways to fill it by summing up the results from smaller subproblems.

We use memoization to store the solutions to subproblems and avoid redundant calculations. This allows us to solve the problem in O(N*M) time complexity.

Finally, we return the result for the initial state (N, 0).
