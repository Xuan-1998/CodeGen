===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

Let's define the state as dp[i][j], representing the number of different steady tables of size i x j.
The base case is when i == 1, where there is only one way to fill the table (i.e., a single row with all elements being M). This can be represented as dp[1][j] = 1 for all j.

For the recursive case, consider filling the last row of the sub-table. There are two possibilities: either the sum of the elements in the last row is equal to the maximum possible value (i.e., M), or it's less than that. This can be represented as dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][k] * (M-k+1) for k from 0 to M, where k represents the sum of the elements in the last row.

To ensure the sums in each row are non-decreasing, we need to add an additional condition. For j > i-1, if the sum of the elements in the last row is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in the (i-1)th row, then dp[i][j] = 0.

The final answer would be dp[N][M].

Memoization can be used to store the intermediate results and avoid redundant computations.
