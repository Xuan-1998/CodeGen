===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

Let dp[i][j] denote the number of different steady tables of size i x j. The state is represented by two parameters: n_rows (number of rows) and m_cols (number of columns).

The base case is when all rows are filled, which corresponds to dp[N][M].

For each sub-table, we need to consider whether the last row has sum equal to or less than m_cols. If prev_row_sum > m_cols, then there's only one way to fill the sub-table: all rows have sums equal to m_cols, so add to memoized values.

Use a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization by defining a recursive function that calculates dp[i][j] and store the results in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

The recurrence relation is:

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k]) if prev_row_sum <= j
         = 1 else

where prev_row_sum is the sum of elements in the (i-1)th row, and k ranges from 0 to m_cols inclusive.

Store the results in a dictionary memo to avoid redundant calculations: memo[(i, j)] = dp[i][j]

Finally, return the value at dp[N][M] as the total number of different steady tables modulo 1 000 000 000.
