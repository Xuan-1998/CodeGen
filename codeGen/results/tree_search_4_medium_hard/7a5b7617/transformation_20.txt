===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

The state is a tuple (n_rows, m_cols) representing the current row and column indices. The base case is when all rows are filled (n_rows == 0), in which case there is only one way to fill the table: an empty table.

If m_cols > 0, then there are m_cols * (sum of all previous elements in the row) + 1 ways to choose next element. This is because each element can be chosen from the range [0, sum], and we need to consider the case where the entire row is filled with maximum value.

The recursive function should take the current row number n_rows and column number m_cols as arguments, and store its result in a dictionary for future reference.

Here's a more detailed outline of the dynamic programming approach:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary memo.
2. Define a recursive function dp(n_rows, m_cols) that calculates the number of ways to fill the sub-table with n_rows rows and m_cols columns.
3. If n_rows == 0 (base case), return 1.
4. If m_cols == 0, return 0 (since there are no more columns to fill).
5. Calculate the sum of all previous elements in the row: prev_sum = sum(range(n_rows)).
6. There are m_cols * prev_sum + 1 ways to choose next element:
   a. Choose an element from [0, prev_sum].
   b. Recursively call dp(n_rows - 1, m_cols - 1) with updated state.
7. Store the result in memo: memo[(n_rows, m_cols)] = ...
8. Return the stored value or calculate it if not present.

The edge cases to consider are:
- If N == 0 (no rows), return 1.
- If M == 0 (no columns), return 0.
- If both N and M are 0, return 1.

This plan should give you a good starting point for solving the problem. Make sure to test your solution with various input cases to ensure it's correct.

Note: This is a top-down dynamic programming approach using memoization. The time complexity of this approach would be O(N*M), where N and M are the number of rows and columns respectively.
