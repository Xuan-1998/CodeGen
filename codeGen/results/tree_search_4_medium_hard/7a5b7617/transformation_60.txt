===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by using Dynamic Programming with memoization.

1. Define a state dp[i][j] where i is the row index and j is the sum of elements in each row, up to that point. The base case is when the sums of all rows except the first one are equal to or greater than 1.
2. Initialize a 2D array memo with size N x M initialized to -1, where N is the number of rows and M is the sum of elements in each row.
3. Implement a recursive function table_configurations(i, j) that takes two parameters: i (the current row index), and j (the current sum of elements in each row).
4. In the base case (i == 1), return 1 if j <= M, otherwise return 0.
5. For i > 1:
    a. Check if memo[i][j] is already computed. If it is, return memo[i][j].
    b. Initialize result to 0.
    c. Iterate over possible table configurations for the current row (1 ≤ k ≤ j):
        i. For each configuration, recursively call table_configurations(i - 1, j - k) and add the result to result.
    d. Return result modulo 1 000 000 000.
