===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, such as calculating the number of ways to fill a sub-table. This suggests using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

The state is a set of rows, where each row is represented as a list of integers and the base case is when all rows are filled.

To calculate the number of different steady tables, we can iterate over the sum of elements in each row from 0 to M. For each possible sum, there are N ways to distribute it among the columns. Then recursively call with updated state (n_rows + 1).

We store the calculated values in a dictionary memo = {(i, j): ...}.

The final answer is the value stored at (N, M) in the memo dictionary modulo 1 000 000 000.
