===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has overlapping subproblems, which can be solved by using a bottom-up approach with tabulation.

Consider the number of steady tables ending at each cell as the state, where the base case is when all cells are filled with non-negative integers. Let the state be a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to fill the first i rows with non-negative integers such that the sums of elements in each row are monotonically increasing.

Then, the state transitions can be formulated as follows: if cell (i, j) is filled with k, then the possible states for the top-left and top-right cells are dp[i-1][j-k] and dp[i-1][j].

Tabulation can be implemented using a 3D array where dp[i][j][prev_sum] represents the number of ways to fill the first i rows with non-negative integers such that the sums of elements in each row are monotonically increasing.

To handle edge cases, initialize all cells in the base case as 1 (since there is only one way to fill the entire table).

To avoid overcounting, consider the cumulative sum of each row and use this information to filter out invalid states. This can be done by checking if the cumulative sum at each state is less than or equal to M.

Finally, initialize the answer as 0 and update it for each cell in the base case. The final answer represents the total number of different steady tables modulo 1 000 000 000.
