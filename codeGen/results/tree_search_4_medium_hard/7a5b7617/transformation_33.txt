1. Initialize 2D array dp with size (N+1) x (M+1) and fill it up recursively:
    - For each cell dp[i][j], calculate sum of all possible table configurations ending at cell (i, j).
    - This could involve building up from base cases.
    - dp[0][j] = 1 for all j because only one way to fill the first row (all elements are zero).
    - dp[i][0] = 1 for i > 0 because only one way to fill the ith column (all elements are zero in this case).
2. Update dp[i][k] based on dp[i-1][0:k]:
    - For each cell dp[i][k], update it as sum of all possible table configurations ending at cell (i, j) for all j <= k.
    - This could involve iterating over the previous rows to count different ways of filling the ith row and then combining them with different ways of filling the kth column.
3. Calculate number of different steady tables:
    - Initialize a variable total as 0.
    - For each cell dp[N][j], add it to total because it represents the sum of all possible table configurations ending at cell (N, j) and Nth row is less than or equal to M.
    - Return total modulo 1 000 000 000.

This plan seems correct but needs refinement. It can be improved by using a more efficient way to update dp[i][k] rather than iterating over the previous rows. One possible approach is to use a prefix sum array to keep track of the sums of elements in each row, and then update dp[i][k] based on this prefix sum array.

The plan does not include edge cases but can be easily modified to handle them. For example, when N or M is 0, there is only one way to fill the table (all elements are zero), so return 1.
