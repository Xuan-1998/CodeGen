===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are mutually independent. This suggests that a bottom-up approach with tabulation could be effective.

Let's define the state as the number of used towers and the remaining towns to place signal powers on. The transition relationship is that we can increment the number of used towers by 1, or decrement the remaining towns to place signal powers on by 1.

The base case is when all towns are placed (i.e., no more remaining towns), which has a probability of 1 if there are enough used towers to place signal powers on each town. If not, it's 0.

To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can define the function dp(i) as the probability that the first i used towers will be sufficient to place signal powers on all towns.

The recursive function with memoization could be defined as:

dp(i) = (1/2) * ( sum of probabilities that i-th tower is used and dp(i-1) ) + (1/2) * ( sum of probabilities that i-th tower is not used and dp(i) )

Where the base case is dp(0) = 1 if n choose 0 > 0, and 0 otherwise.

The answer will be dp(n).
