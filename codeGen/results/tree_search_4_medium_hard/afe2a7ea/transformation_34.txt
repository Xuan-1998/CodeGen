The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are mutually independent. This suggests that a bottom-up approach with tabulation could be effective.

The state is indeed the current signal power, which ranges from 1 to n. The transition relationship is correct - we can either add or subtract one to the signal power. However, there's a crucial observation: when adding or subtracting one to the signal power, it doesn't affect whether a town receives signal or not.

The base case is actually when the signal power is at its maximum value (n) or minimum value (1). This is because in these cases, no further adjustments can be made to ensure all towns receive signals from exactly one tower each.

The base case is also when there are no more towers to place signals. In this scenario, we simply need to check if the current signal power setting meets all constraints.

To implement memoization, we can use a dictionary where the key is the current state (signal power) and the value is the probability of placing signals in this way.

A possible issue with this plan is that it doesn't account for edge cases. What happens when n = 1? Shouldn't there be some special handling for this case?

Another potential issue is that we might need to consider the order in which towers are built, as building a tower at a certain position might affect the signal power settings of subsequent towers.
