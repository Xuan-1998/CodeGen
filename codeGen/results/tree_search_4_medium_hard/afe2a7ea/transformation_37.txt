The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are mutually independent, which suggests that a bottom-up approach with tabulation could be effective.

The state is indeed the number of used towers and the transition relationship is that we can increment this number by 1. The base case is when all towers are unused, which has a probability of ${n \choose 0} (\frac{1}{2})^{n+2}$.

Consider a state as the current used tower and the transition relationship is that we can increment this number by 1 or stay at the same value (i.e., not use any more towers). This can be modeled using dynamic programming, where each state has two possibilities: either use one more tower or not use any more towers.

Memoization could be applied using a dictionary to store and retrieve intermediate results, which would help reduce redundant calculations. The time complexity of this approach would be O(n^2), where n is the number of used towers (which is at most n+2).

The plan also covers edge cases: when all towers are unused, we have a base case with probability ${n \choose 0} (\frac{1}{2})^{n+2}$.

This plan looks correct and provides a good starting point. To improve it, you could consider using bit masking to reduce the number of states needed for memoization.
