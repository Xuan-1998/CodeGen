The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are mutually independent, which suggests that a bottom-up approach with tabulation could be effective.

State: whether each tower is used (1) or not used (0). The base case is when all towers are unused, which has a probability of 2^-n. This base case can be calculated directly without needing to consider any previous subproblems.

The transition relationship could be that the next state depends on the current state of all towers, with two possible transitions: either a tower is used or it's not. This implies that for each tower, we have two possibilities - whether it's used or not. This can be modeled as a binary string of length n, where 1 represents the tower being used and 0 represents it not being used.

Dynamic programming can be implemented using a 2D table to store the probabilities for each subproblem. The state transition diagram could be represented as follows:

dp[i][j] = probability that i towers are used and j is the current binary string

The base case would be when i = 0, dp[0][j] = 1/2^(n+1), because there's a 1 in 2^(n+1) chance that no tower is used.

For each state dp[i-1][k], we consider two possibilities:
- If the (i-1)th tower is not used, then dp[i-1][k] = dp[i-1][0...k-1]*1/2
- If the (i-1)th tower is used, then dp[i-1][k] = dp[i-1][0...k-1]*1

We can use this to calculate dp[i][j], which represents the probability that i towers are used and j is the current binary string.

The final answer would be dp[n][0...2^n-1]-dp[n-1][0...2^n-1], because we want to subtract the case where no tower is used, which has been counted in dp[n-1][0...2^n-1].

This plan accounts for all edge cases and seems correct.
