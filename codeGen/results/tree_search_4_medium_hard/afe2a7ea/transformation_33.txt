The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are mutually independent. This suggests that a bottom-up approach with tabulation could be effective.

Let's define our state as (town, signal power), where town is in range [1, n] and signal power is in range [-n, n]. The transition relationship is that we can either move to the next town with the same signal power or change the signal power by 1. This means we need a 2D table dp of size (n + 1) x (2 * n + 1).

The base case is when there are no more towns to place signals, i.e., dp[n][0] = dp[0][-n] = 1, because we can always choose not to place any signal.

For each town i and signal power j, the transition relationship says that we have two choices: either move to the next town with the same signal power (dp[i-1][j]) or change the signal power by 1 (dp[i-1][j+1] + dp[i-1][j-1]). This means our state transitions are as follows:

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j+1] + dp[i-1][j-1]

The final answer is the sum of all entries in the last row (i.e., n) and the first column (i.e., j=0), because this represents the number of ways to place signals such that towns [1, n] get signal from exactly one tower each.

The total time complexity for this approach would be O(n * 2n), which is polynomial in terms of input size. This should work efficiently.
