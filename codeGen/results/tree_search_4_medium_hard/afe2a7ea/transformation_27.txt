The plan seems reasonable and well-structured.

The idea of breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems that are mutually independent is a great approach for dynamic programming problems. The state description and transition relationship also seem correct, as they capture the essence of the problem.

One potential issue with this plan is that it might be difficult to determine how many signal powers can be set given the current number of unused towers. This could lead to some complicated logic or multiple nested loops in the DP array iteration.

To make the plan more concrete and easier to implement, here's an updated version:
