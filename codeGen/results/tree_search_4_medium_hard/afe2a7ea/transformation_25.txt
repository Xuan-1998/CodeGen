===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are mutually independent, allowing for a bottom-up approach with tabulation. The state for each tower is whether it's used (1) or not used (0). The base case is when all towers are unused, which has a probability of 2^-n.

State: whether each tower is used (1) or not used (0). The transition relationship could be that the next state depends on the current state of all towers, with two possible transitions: either a tower is used or it's not. This means we can define a recursive function that takes the current state as input and returns the probability of moving to the next state.

To avoid repeated computations, memoization can be applied by storing the results of the recursive function in a dictionary. We can use dynamic programming to build up the solution by iteratively computing the probabilities for each subproblem.

The base case would be when all towers are unused (all zeros), and we can start building up the solution from there.

We'll need to handle edge cases, such as when n is 0 or 1. In these cases, the probability of finding a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met is simply 1 if n is 0, and 1/2^n if n is 1.
