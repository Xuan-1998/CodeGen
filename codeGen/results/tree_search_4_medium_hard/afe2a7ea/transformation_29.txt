===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are mutually independent. This suggests that a bottom-up approach with tabulation could be effective.

Let dp[i][j] be the probability that we have i unused towers and the signal power is j for the town currently being processed. The base case is when all towers are unused, which has a probability of 2^-n.

The state transition relationship can be described as follows:

- If there are i+1 unused towers and no tower is used yet, the next state would have i unused towers.
- If there are i+1 unused towers and one tower is used (with probability 1/2), then we have i unused towers left.
- If there are i unused towers and we already assigned a signal power to this town, the number of unused towers remains the same.

We can use a 2D array dp to store the results. Let dp[i][j] be the probability that we have i unused towers and the signal power is j for the town currently being processed. The base case is when all towers are unused, which has a probability of 2^-n.

The final answer would be the sum of probabilities over all states where there's only one unused tower left (i.e., i = n - 1), since we want to find a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met. The answer can be taken modulo 998244353.
