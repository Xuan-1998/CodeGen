1. The base case is when all towers are unused, which has a probability of 2^-n.
   This is correct. When no tower is used, there's only one state (all zeros), and its probability is indeed 2^-n.

2. State: whether each tower is used (1) or not used (0).
   This is correct. The state for each tower can be represented by a binary string of length n, where 1 means the tower is used, and 0 means it's not.

3. The transition relationship could be that the next state depends on the current state of all towers, with two possible transitions: either a tower is used or it's not.
   This is correct. For each binary string representing the state of the towers, there are only two ways to change this state: by turning one more tower ON (by setting its corresponding bit from 0 to 1), or by turning one more tower OFF (by setting its corresponding bit from 1 to 0).

4. A bottom-up approach with tabulation can be used to build up the solution from smaller subproblems, where the state of each tower is whether it's used or not.
   This is correct. Dynamic programming is a perfect fit for this problem.

5. The plan does not include edge cases. It would be good to add a check at the beginning of the program to ensure that n is within the allowed range (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5).

6. There's no mention of how to calculate the final answer from the tabulation results. This should also be included in the plan.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
