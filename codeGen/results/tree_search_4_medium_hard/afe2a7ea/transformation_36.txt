===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are mutually independent. This suggests that a bottom-up approach with tabulation could be effective.

The state is the number of used towers and the transition relationship is that we can increment this number by 1. The base case is when all towers are unused, which has a probability of n choose 0.

We can consider a state as the current used tower and the transition relationship is that we can either stay at the same state (i.e., not use any more towers) or move to a new state by using one more tower. The probability of staying at the same state is the probability of the current used tower, which is dp[i - 1] * (n choose i). The probability of moving to a new state is dp[i - 2] * (n choose i + 1).

The dynamic programming approach could be implemented using a bottom-up DP table where each cell dp[i] represents the probability of i towers being used.

We start by initializing the base case, then fill up the DP table row by row from left to right. Finally, we return dp[n].
