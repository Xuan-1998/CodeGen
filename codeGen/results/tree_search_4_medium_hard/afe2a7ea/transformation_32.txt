The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are mutually independent. This suggests that a bottom-up approach with tabulation could be effective.

The state is indeed the current signal power and the transition relationship is that we can either add or subtract one to the signal power. The base case is when the signal power is at its minimum or maximum value, which is 1.

However, instead of using a tuple as the state, it would be more efficient to use the current signal power as the state variable. This reduces the state space from O(n^2) to O(n).

The transition relationship remains the same: we can either increment or decrement the signal power by one.

Employ a bottom-up approach with a 1D table to store the probability of setting signal powers for each possible signal power value.

Initialize the base cases: when the signal power is at its minimum (1) or maximum value, the probability of setting signal powers is 0 or 1 respectively.

Fill in the rest of the table by considering all possible transitions from each state and summing up the probabilities. The final answer would be the probability of setting signal powers for the maximum signal power value.
