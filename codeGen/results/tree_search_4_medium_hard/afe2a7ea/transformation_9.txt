===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, as solving it for a larger instance of the problem can be solved by solving smaller instances. Therefore, a top-down approach with memoization is suitable.

dp[i][j] could represent the number of ways to select tower locations such that all towns get signal from exactly one tower and the total number of towers is j.

Let dp[i][j] be the number of ways to set signal powers on n-1 towns such that no town gets signal from more than one tower, and j out of these n-1 towns have towers; transition relationship is: dp[i][j+1] = sum(dp[k][i] for k in range(i)); 

dp[n][0] represents the base case where there are no towers. Therefore, dp[n][0] should be 1.

Using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with a 2D array, where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to set signal powers on i towns such that no town gets signal from more than one tower and j out of these i towns have towers. 

Transition relationship: dp[i][j+1] = sum(dp[k][i-1] for k in range(i)); 

The final answer is dp[0][n], the number of ways to set signal powers on all towns such that no town gets signal from more than one tower and n out of these i towns have towers.
