===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, as solving it for a larger instance of the problem can be solved by solving smaller instances. Therefore, a top-down approach with memoization is suitable.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to set signal powers for towns 0, 1, ..., i with exactly j radio towers built so far.
dp[i][j] = or_(0 <= j <= i, any(k in range(i), k != j and not dp[k-1][min(j+1, i-k)]))

To implement memoization by using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computation.
