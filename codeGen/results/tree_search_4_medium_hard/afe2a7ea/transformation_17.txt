===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, as solving it for a larger instance of the problem can be solved by solving smaller instances. Therefore, a top-down approach with memoization is suitable.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to set signal powers for all towns up to i, given that radio towers are built in exactly j towns out of the first i - 1 towns and the last town i. The value of j is between 0 and i.

dp[i][j] = True if and only if there exists a way to set signal powers for all towns up to i, given that radio towers are built in exactly j towns out of the first i - 1 towns and the last town i.

The dynamic programming approach could be implemented by creating a memoized function where the state expression is dp[i][j] which represents whether it's possible to set signal powers for all towns up to i, given that radio towers are built in exactly j towns out of the first i - 1 towns and the last town i.

The base case would be when i = 0 or j = 0. In this case, dp[i][j] would always be True because there is no constraint for these cases.

To fill up the dp table, we need to consider two possibilities: either a radio tower is built in the current town i, or not. If a radio tower is built in the current town i, then j should decrease by 1 and we need to check if it's possible to set signal powers for all towns up to i - 1 with exactly j - 1 towers.

If no radio tower is built in the current town i, then j remains the same and we need to check if it's possible to set signal powers for all towns up to i with exactly j towers.

The final answer would be dp[n][n], which represents whether it's possible to set signal powers for all towns with exactly n - 1 radio towers built in the first n towns and none in the last town.
