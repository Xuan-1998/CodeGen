The plan is correct in that it recognizes the problem as being suitable for dynamic programming and breaks down the state space into smaller subproblems.

To improve the plan, consider the following:

* Instead of using (used_towers, used_signals) as the state, you could just use used_towers because once a tower is used, all signals from that tower are consumed.
* The transition relationship could be simplified to only considering whether it's possible to use a new tower or not, without worrying about the specific signal.

Potential issues with the plan:

* Edge case: What if n = 0? In this case, there are no towers and hence no signals. You would need to explicitly handle this edge case.
* Optimality: The current plan does not guarantee that it will find the optimal solution. It might be possible to use a more advanced dynamic programming approach to get the correct answer.
