===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are mutually independent. This suggests that a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming could be effective.

The state is indeed the number of used towers and the transition relationship is that we can increment this number by 1. The base case is when all towers are unused, which has a probability of (n+2) choose n, since there are no signals to be sent yet.

A state could be represented as (used_towers, used_signals) where used_towers represents the number of towers used and used_signals represents the set of signals that have been used so far. The transition relationship would then be based on whether it's possible to use a new tower with a new signal without violating any constraints.

However, there is an issue with this plan: it does not consider the constraint that towns 0 and n+1 do not receive any signal from the towers. This means we need to keep track of which signals have been assigned to each town, as well as the number of used towers.

To fix this, let's represent the state as (used_towers, unused_signals), where unused_signals is the set of signals that have not been assigned to any towns yet. The transition relationship would then be based on whether it's possible to assign a new signal from unused_signals to an unassigned town without violating any constraints.

We can apply memoization using a function that takes the current state as an argument and returns the result of the recursive call.
