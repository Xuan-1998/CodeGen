===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, as solving it for a larger instance of the problem can be solved by solving smaller instances. Therefore, a top-down approach with memoization is suitable.

The state expression could be dp[i] where dp[i] represents whether it's possible to set signal powers for all towns up to i, given that radio towers are built in exactly i - 1 towns.
dp[i] represents the minimum number of radio towers needed to be built to cover all towns up to i.

To implement dynamic programming using recursion with memoization, you can store the results of subproblems in a dictionary and update it as you solve each subproblem.

The base case would be dp[0] = 1, because it's always possible to set signal powers for no towns.

For larger instances, you would need to iterate over all possibilities for building radio towers up to i - 1, and recursively calculate the probabilities for each of these possibilities. You would then choose the possibility that gives the highest probability.

This process is repeated until dp[n] is calculated, which represents the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met.

The final answer would be dp[n].
