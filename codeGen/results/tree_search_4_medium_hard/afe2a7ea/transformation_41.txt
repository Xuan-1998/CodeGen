===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are mutually independent. This suggests that a bottom-up approach with tabulation could be effective.

Let's define our state as (used_towers, last_town), where used_towers represents the number of towers used and last_town represents the town number for which the signal power has been set. The base case is when all towers are unused, which has a probability of n choose 0.

For each possible state, we can calculate the transition probabilities to the next states by considering whether it's possible to set the signal power for the current town without violating any constraints. Specifically:

* If used_towers is less than n and last_town + 1 <= n, we have a choice of using or not using the next tower, which gives us two possible transitions: (used_towers+1, last_town) with probability 1/2, and (used_towers, last_town) with probability 1 - 1/2.
* If used_towers is equal to n, we cannot use any more towers, so there's only one possible transition: (used_towers, last_town+1).

We can store the intermediate results in a dictionary and retrieve them when needed. The final answer will be the sum of the probabilities for all states where last_town equals n.

This plan seems to capture the essential idea behind the problem, but it might not be efficient enough to handle large values of n. To improve this plan, we could consider using a more efficient data structure, such as a prefix sum array, to store and retrieve the intermediate results.
