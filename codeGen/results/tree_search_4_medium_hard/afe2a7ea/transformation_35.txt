===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are mutually independent. This suggests that a bottom-up approach with tabulation could be effective.

The state is the current signal power and the transition relationship is that we can either add or subtract one to the signal power. The base case is when the signal power is at its minimum or maximum value, which means there is no more town to place signals for the corresponding signal power.

Use a 3D table where the states are (current town, current signal power, remaining towns) and the transition relationship is that we can either add or subtract one to the signal power. The base case is when there are no more towns to place signals.

The state transition function would be as follows:
- If it's the first town, then only the minimum signal power can be used.
- If it's not the last town and the signal power is less than the remaining number of towns, we have two choices: increase or decrease the signal power by 1.
- If it's not the last town and the signal power is equal to the remaining number of towns, we have only one choice: decrease the signal power by 1.
- If it's the last town, then only the minimum signal power can be used.

The final answer would be the sum of all possible signal powers that meet all constraints.
