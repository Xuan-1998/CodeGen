===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are mutually independent, suggesting a bottom-up approach with tabulation could be effective.

The state is indeed the number of used towers and the transition relationship is that we can increment this number by 1. The base case is when all towers are unused, which has a probability of n choose 0.

A state could be represented as (used_towers, last_town) where used_towers represents the number of towers used and last_town represents the town number for which the signal power has been set. The transition relationship would then be based on whether it's possible to set the signal power for the current town without violating any constraints.

DP with a 2D table where state is (used_towers, last_town) and value at each cell represents the probability of setting signal powers correctly up to that point.

For example, when used_towers == n-1, it means we have used all towers except for one. In this case, there are only two possibilities: we set the signal power for the last town using the remaining tower or not use the remaining tower at all.

This plan considers edge cases correctly.
