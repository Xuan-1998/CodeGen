===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are mutually independent, suggesting a bottom-up approach with tabulation could be effective.

Let's represent the state as (used_towers, last_signal), where used_towers represents the number of used towers and last_signal represents the signal power set for the last town. The transition relationship would then be based on whether it's possible to set the signal power for the current town without violating any constraints.

The base case is when all towers are unused (used_towers = 0), which has a probability of C(n, 0) * (1/2)^n. To calculate this probability, we can use dynamic programming:

* Initialize dp[0][_] = [C(n, 0)]^n
* For each used_towers from 1 to n:
	+ Calculate the probability for the current configuration by multiplying the previous probabilities for configurations with fewer used towers
	+ Update dp[used_towers][_]

The final answer would be dp[n][last_signal] taken modulo 998244353.

This approach ensures we consider all possible configurations and avoids counting duplicates. It also correctly handles edge cases, such as when all towers are unused (base case) or when only one tower is used.
