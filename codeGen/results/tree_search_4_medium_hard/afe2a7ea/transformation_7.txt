===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, as solving it for a larger instance of the problem can be solved by solving smaller instances. Therefore, a top-down approach with memoization is suitable.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to set signal powers for towns 0, 1, ..., i with exactly j radio towers built so far.

dp[i][j] = and_(min(2*i-1, j) >= 1, (k != 0 || i % 2 == 0), dp[i-1][min(j-1, i-1)])

Memoization using LRU Cache: Use a least-recently-used cache to store the results of subproblems.

The base case is dp[0][j] = False for all j > 0, as there are no towns to set signal powers for.

The transition from state dp[i][j] to state dp[i-1][k] can be made when k != 0 || i % 2 == 0, ensuring that the last town is not forced to receive a signal and the signal power of the tower in town i is at least i.

The final answer would be dp[n][n].
