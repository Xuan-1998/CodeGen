dp[i][k] = whether it's possible to place k towers in towns 1 to i,
and each tower sends signal only to one town.

dp[i][0] = True (base case)
since we don't need any towers for no towns

dp[0][k] = False for all k > 0
since we can't place a tower in the first town with probability 1/2

dp[i][k] = dp[i-1][k-1] or (dp[i-1][k-1] and dp[i-1][k-1]) (1 - 1/2) if i > 0
since we can either place a tower in the current town with probability 1/2
or not place it and the previous towns still work
with probability (1 - 1/2)

Memoization:
store dp[i][k] in a dictionary for each unique pair (i, k)
to avoid redundant calculations

Edge cases: 
dp[0][0] = True
since we don't need any towers for no towns
