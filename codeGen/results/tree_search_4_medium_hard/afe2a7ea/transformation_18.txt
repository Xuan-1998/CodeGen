===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has an optimal substructure, as solving it for a larger instance of the problem can be solved by solving smaller instances. Therefore, a top-down approach with memoization is suitable.

The state expression could be dp[i] where dp[i] represents whether it's possible to set signal powers for all towns up to i, given that radio towers are built in exactly i - 1 towns.

dp[i] = True if and only if there exists a way to set signal powers for all towns up to i, given that radio towers are built in exactly i - 1 towns.

For dp[i], we can recursively consider two cases:
- If the i-th town is not covered by any tower, then it's possible to set signal powers for all towns up to i if and only if there exists a way to set signal powers for all towns up to i-1, given that radio towers are built in exactly i - 2 towns.
- If the i-th town is covered by one of the i-1 towers, then it's possible to set signal powers for all towns up to i if and only if there exists a way to set signal powers for all towns up to i-1, given that radio towers are built in exactly i - 2 towns.

This recursion can be stopped when i = 0 or i = n+1, since these towns are not affected by the signal power of any tower. The base case dp[0] is always True and dp[n+1] is always False.

We then use memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computation. This can be implemented using a dictionary or an array.

The plan is correct, but it's not very efficient as we need to consider all cases for each town. We can improve this by implementing tabulation where we create an array dp of size n+2 with initial values False and then update the values based on the problem constraints.
