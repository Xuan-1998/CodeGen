===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem seems to be related to a tree data structure, so consider using memoized DFS to explore the tree and optimize the solution.

The state expression could be the minimum value that needs to be added to all nodes in the subtree rooted at a given node, with the root node as the starting point. The base case would be when the current node has no children, and the solution is simply the range value of the node itself.

Consider using a dictionary to store the state, where each key corresponds to a node in the tree, and its corresponding value is the minimum number of operations needed to adjust all vertices to their respective ranges for that node. The transition relationship could be defined as a recursive function that updates the state based on the values of the child nodes.

Consider implementing a bottom-up approach using dynamic programming. Start by initializing the state dictionary with base cases (nodes with no children), then iteratively update the states of nodes based on their children's states, working from the leaves up to the root node. This ensures that all necessary information is computed before considering each node, reducing the risk of redundant computation.

Also, consider storing and updating the maximum range value for each node while traversing the tree. This would allow you to efficiently determine if a given node is within its respective range during the dynamic programming process.
