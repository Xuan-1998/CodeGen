===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem seems to be related to a tree data structure, so consider using memoized DFS to explore the tree and optimize the solution.

To refine the state expression, let's denote $dp[i]$ as the minimum number of operations needed to adjust all values in the subtree rooted at node $i$. The recursive formula could be: 

$dp[i] = \min\limits_{j \in ancestors(i)} (dp[j] + |r_i - l_i|)$

where $ancestors(i)$ is the set of ancestors of node $i$, and $l_i, r_i$ are the range values for node $i$. This formula captures the idea that we can adjust the values in a subtree by adding to or subtracting from the values in its ancestor nodes.

The base case would be when the current node has no children, and the solution is simply the range value of the node itself. In this case, $dp[i] = |r_i - l_i|$.

To calculate the minimum number of operations needed for each subtree, design a recursive function that iterates through all nodes in the tree, calculating the state values recursively based on the formula above.
