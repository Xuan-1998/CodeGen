===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying tabulation or memoization to find the minimum number of operations needed.

1. **Base Case**: When i is equal to n, there are no more vertices to process. This would correspond to reaching the root node in the DAG.
2. **Modeling the Problem as a DAG**: Each node represents a vertex and its corresponding value range. The edges represent the parent-child relationships between vertices.
3. **Tabulation or Memoization**: Traverse the graph in topological order, using a 2D table to store the minimum number of operations for each vertex and its ancestors.

**Optimization**: To avoid redundant calculations, consider using memoization instead of tabulation. This would involve storing the intermediate results in a cache, so that once the result is calculated for a given node, it can be retrieved directly without recalculating it.

**Edge Cases**:
- What if there are no vertices with no ancestors (i.e., leaves)? How will this affect the calculation?
- Are there any edge cases related to handling overlapping value ranges?
