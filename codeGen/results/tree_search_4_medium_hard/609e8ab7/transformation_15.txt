===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem seems to be related to a tree data structure, so consider using memoized DFS to explore the tree and optimize the solution.

The state expression could be the maximum value that needs to be subtracted from all nodes in the subtree rooted at a given node, with the root node as the starting point. The base case would be when the current node has no children, and the solution is simply the range value of the node itself.

Think about using a tree-like data structure (e.g., segment tree) to maintain information about the current maximum and minimum values in each subtree as you traverse the tree.

Consider implementing memoized DFS with dynamic programming for efficient computation of state transitions.

To improve the plan, consider using a more specific data structure for the state expression, such as a Fenwick Tree or a binary indexed tree (BIT), to efficiently compute prefix sums and updates. This could reduce the time complexity of the problem.

To handle edge cases, make sure to check if the input is valid before processing it, i.e., ensure that all node values are within their respective ranges, and that all parent pointers are valid.
