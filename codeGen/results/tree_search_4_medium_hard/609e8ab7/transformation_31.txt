===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying tabulation or memoization to find the minimum number of operations needed.

The base case could be when i is equal to n, and there are no more vertices to process.

You can define a state as the number of vertices that still need to be processed, along with the cumulative sum of the values needed for each vertex's range. The transition relationship could involve recursively exploring child nodes and updating the state based on the values required.

Apply top-down memoization by defining a recursive function that returns the minimum number of operations needed to adjust all vertices from i to n, and memoizing intermediate results.

For edge cases, consider handling when i is less than 2 (in which case there are no more vertices to process) or when the value range for each vertex is already within its respective range (in which case no operations are required).

Apply memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary and checking if the result has been computed before, to avoid redundant computation.

The plan can be improved by:

* Using dynamic programming instead of recursive memoization
* Implementing more efficient data structures for storing states and transitions

Potential issues with the plan include:

* Handling edge cases correctly (e.g., when i is less than 2)
* Ensuring that the recursive function does not exceed the maximum recursion depth
