===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying tabulation to find the minimum number of operations needed.

DP state could be a 2D array, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its range [0, j]. The state transition would be based on the values of the ancestors of vertex i and their corresponding ranges.

Initially, set all dp[i][j] = infinity for vertices that are not the root (i.e., vertices with parent p_i > 1). For the root node (vertex 1), set dp[1][0] = 0. This is because we can adjust its value to any range without using any operations.

For each vertex i and j, where 1 <= i < n and 0 <= j <= r_i, compute the minimum number of operations needed as follows:

- If vertex i has no ancestors or all its ancestors have already been processed (i.e., dp[p_i][j] is not infinity), update dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[p_i][max(0, j - r_p_i)] + 1) if the current value of vertex i can be adjusted to range [0, j] using one operation.

- If vertex i has no ancestors or all its ancestors have already been processed and the above update is not applicable, set dp[i][j] = infinity. This indicates that it's impossible to adjust vertex i's value to range [0, j] without using any operations.

Finally, return dp[n-1][r_n-1], which represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust all vertices' values to their respective ranges.
