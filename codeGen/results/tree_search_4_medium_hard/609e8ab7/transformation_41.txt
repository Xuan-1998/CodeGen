===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying tabulation or memoization to find the minimum number of operations needed.

Define state as a 1D array, where dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its range [l_i, r_i], considering all ancestors of vertex i have already been processed. The base case would be when the vertex is the root, in which case we need to calculate the difference between the current value and the range.

Iterate through all vertices from leaves to the root. For each vertex i, consider its parent j. Calculate the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value by considering two options: either adjust vertex i's value to be equal to vertex j's value (dp[j] + 1), or directly adjust vertex i's value to be within its range [l_i, r_i]. 

Update dp[i] with the minimum of these two options. This will ensure that we only consider ancestors of vertex i when calculating the minimum number of operations needed.

At the end of the iteration, return dp[1], which represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust the root's value.
