===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem seems to be related to a tree data structure, so consider using memoized DFS to explore the tree and optimize the solution.

The state expression could be the number of operations required to adjust all vertices at a given node, with the root node as the starting point. The base case would be when the current node has no children, and the solution is simply 0.

To consider each node's value adjustment as a separate state with its own set of transitions; for example, one transition could be 'add this value to all descendants' and another could be 'adjust by this value and then recursively apply the same operation to children'.

Consider using an array to store the memoization results for each node, where the index corresponds to the node's ID. This way, you can avoid redundant calculations and optimize the solution.

Before starting the DFS, initialize the memo array with a large value (e.g., 10^9) to ensure that all nodes have their values set initially. During the DFS, update the memo array accordingly.

After finishing the DFS, return the value stored in the root node's position as the minimum number of operations required.
