===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a dynamic programming problem where we keep track of the minimum number of operations needed to adjust each vertex's value to its range [l_i, r_i].
Let dp[i][j] represent the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its range [l_1, j]. 
The state transition would be based on the values of the ancestors of vertex i. For a given vertex i, let a be the maximum value among the ranges of all its ancestors (including itself). Then, we can update dp[i][j] as follows:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j] + 1 for k in ancestors(i)) + |j - l_i|

where ancestors(i) is the set of vertices that are ancestors of vertex i.

We implement tabulation by iterating over the vertices in reverse topological order. 
For each vertex, we update dp[i][r_i] to be the minimum number of operations needed to adjust its value to its range [l_i, r_i].
The final answer is simply dp[1][r_1], where 1 is the root node.
