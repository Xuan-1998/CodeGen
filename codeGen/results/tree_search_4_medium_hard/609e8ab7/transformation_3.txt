===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem seems to be related to a tree data structure, so consider using memoized DFS to explore the tree and optimize the solution.

The state expression could be dp[i] = min_operations_to_adjust_all_vertices_at_node_i. The base case would be when the current node has no children, and the solution is simply 0.

To view each node's adjustment as a function of its parent's adjustment, essentially considering the root node as the base case and propagating down the tree. This could involve maintaining some sort of memoized parent-child relationship.

Use a recursive DFS approach with memoization to store the number of operations required for each node, updating the state as you traverse the tree.

For each node i, consider its children j. If there's only one child, update dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j]) + 1 (number of operations required to adjust all vertices at node i and its ancestors).

If there are multiple children, calculate their minimum adjustment values dp[j] for each j, then update dp[i] = min(dp[i], sum(dp[j])) + 1 (number of operations required to adjust all vertices at node i and its ancestors).

Finally, return the value stored in dp[1], which is the minimum number of operations required to adjust all vertices at the root node.
