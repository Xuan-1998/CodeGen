===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem seems to be related to a tree data structure, so consider using memoized DFS to explore the tree and optimize the solution.

Let's define the state as dp[node] = (min_value, parent), where min_value is the minimum value that needs to be added to all nodes in the subtree rooted at node, and parent is the parent of the node itself.

The base case would be when the current node has no children, and the solution is simply the range value of the node itself. In this case, dp[node] = (range_value(node), None).

To update the state for each node based on its parent and child nodes, we can use a priority queue to keep track of the nodes that need to be processed next.

For each node, calculate the minimum value that needs to be added to all nodes in the subtree rooted at that node by iterating over its children. For each child, update dp[child] = (dp[node][0] + range_value(child), node) if the parent is None; otherwise, update dp[child] = (dp[parent][0] + range_value(child), parent).

Insert the root node into the priority queue and process it first. The minimum number of operations needed to adjust all vertices to their respective ranges would be dp[root][0].
