===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a dynamic programming (DP) approach by processing the vertices in topological order.

1. Initialize a 2D table dp[n][10^9] where n is the number of vertices, and each row represents a vertex's range.
   - The base case could be when i is equal to n, and there are no more vertices to process.
   - The state could represent the current vertex being processed, and the transition relationship involves updating the state based on the values required for the current vertex's range, as well as recursively processing child nodes.

2. Iterate through each vertex in topological order (from leaf nodes to root node), starting from i = n-1.
   - For each vertex:
     * Calculate the minimum number of operations needed for this vertex by checking if its value is within its specified range.
     * If not, update dp[i][l_i] with the minimum number of operations needed to adjust this vertex's value to be within its range.

3. For any vertex i having parent p_i (p_i < i), recursively call the DP function on its child nodes and calculate the minimum number of operations needed.
   - The state for each child node is updated by adding the minimum number of operations needed to adjust its own value to be within its specified range.
   - This ensures that all vertices are processed and their values are adjusted accordingly.

4. Finally, return dp[1][r_1], which represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust the root's value (and thus all vertex values) to be within their respective ranges.
