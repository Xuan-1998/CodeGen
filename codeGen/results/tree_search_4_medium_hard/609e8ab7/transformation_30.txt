===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying tabulation or memoization to find the minimum number of operations needed.

The base case could be when i is equal to n, and there are no more vertices to process. You can define a state as the number of vertices that still need to be processed, along with the cumulative sum of the values needed for each vertex's range. The transition relationship could involve recursively exploring child nodes and updating the state based on the values required.

Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach to fill up a 2D table, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust all vertices from i to j. You can initialize dp[0][n-1] as the range value for the root node and recursively update the table using the following steps:

* If i is equal to n, return 0 because there are no more vertices to process.
* If j is equal to i - 1, calculate the difference between the range value of vertex i and the range value of vertex i - 1. Add this difference to dp[i-1][i-2] to get the minimum number of operations needed for all vertices from i-1 to n.
* For each child node j, recursively update dp[i][j] as the minimum of dp[i][k] + 1 (where k is the parent of vertex j) and the difference between the range value of vertex j and the range value of its ancestor.

The final answer will be stored in dp[0][n-1], which represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust all vertices in the tree.
