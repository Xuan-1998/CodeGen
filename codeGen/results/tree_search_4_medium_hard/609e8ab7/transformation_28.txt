===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying tabulation or memoization to find the minimum number of operations needed.
DP state could be a 2D array, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its range [l_i, r_i].
Model the problem as a tree where each node represents a vertex. Define dp[i] as the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its range [l_i, r_i]. 
The state transition would be based on the values of the ancestors of vertex i and the values of the children of vertex i.
Initialize dp[0][j] for all j where root is at index 0. The base case would be that if a node's value is within its range, no operations are needed. 
For each node from bottom up (from leaf nodes to root), update dp[i] based on the values of ancestors and children.
If node i has ancestor j and child k, then dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1, dp[k] + 1) because we can either adjust the value of this node by adding the difference between its range and its parent's range (dp[j] + 1), or by adjusting the values of its children.
Finally, return dp[0][r_1], where r_1 is the root's range.
This plan takes into account all edge cases as it handles the base case for nodes with values within their ranges. It also correctly handles the state transition based on ancestors and children of each node.
