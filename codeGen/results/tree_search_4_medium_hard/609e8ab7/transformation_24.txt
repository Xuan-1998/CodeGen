===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying tabulation or memoization to find the minimum number of operations needed.

DP state could be a 3D array, where dp[i][j][k] represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value from its current value j to its range [l_i, r_i], considering that k is the parent of vertex i.

The problem can be viewed as finding the shortest path from each vertex to the root in a weighted graph. Use dynamic programming with memoization to keep track of the shortest paths and the minimum number of operations needed to adjust each vertex's value.

For each vertex i, consider its ancestors on the path to the root. For each ancestor j of i, update dp[i][j][k] by considering the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value from its current value j to its range [l_i, r_i], and then adding the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex j's value to its range [l_j, r_j].

DP state could be implemented as a 3D array, where dp[i][j][k] represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value from its current value j to its range [l_i, r_i], considering that k is the parent of vertex i.
