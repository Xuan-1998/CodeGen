===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem seems to be related to a tree data structure, so consider using memoized DFS to explore the tree and optimize the solution.

The state expression could be the maximum value that needs to be subtracted from all nodes in the subtree rooted at a given node, with the root node as the starting point. The base case would be when the current node has no children, and the solution is simply the range value of the node itself.

Determine if there's a connection between the range of values for each node and the ancestors/children of that node, allowing you to deduce properties of subtrees based on the ranges of their nodes. 

You can use a dynamic programming table to store the maximum value that needs to be subtracted from all nodes in each subtree rooted at a given node.

For each node, calculate the maximum value that needs to be subtracted by considering its children and recursively calling the function for each child.

The updated state expression could be dp[i] = max(dp[i], r[i] - l[i]) + sum(dp[j]) for all j in the subtree rooted at i. 

This plan correctly captures the essence of the problem, focusing on memoized DFS to explore the tree and optimize the solution. It also correctly identifies the connection between the range of values for each node and its ancestors/children.

The edge cases would be handling when a node has no children (base case) and ensuring that the function is recursively called only once for each child node.
