===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying tabulation or memoization to find the minimum number of operations needed.

DP state could be a 3D array, where dp[i][j][k] represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its range [l_i + k, r_i + k]. This allows us to handle the addition operation in the problem statement.

The problem can be viewed as finding the shortest path from each vertex to the root in a weighted graph. Use dynamic programming with memoization to keep track of the shortest paths and the minimum number of operations needed to adjust each vertex's value.

Tabulate the dynamic programming state by initializing a 3D array dp[n][n][10^9] and fill it using a bottom-up approach.

For each vertex i, iterate from its children up to the root. For each child j, calculate the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex j's value to its range [l_j + k, r_j + k], considering all possible values for k in the range [0, min(r_i - l_i, r_j - l_j)]. 

Update dp[i][j][k] with the minimum value found.

Finally, return the sum of all dp[1][i][0] as the total number of operations needed to adjust all vertices' values to their respective ranges.
