===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem seems to be related to a tree data structure, so consider using memoized DFS to explore the tree and optimize the solution.

The state expression could be a tuple containing the minimum value that needs to be added to all nodes in the subtree rooted at a given node, along with the parent of that node. The base case would be when the current node has no children, and the solution is simply the range value of the node itself.

Consider using a dictionary to store the memoized values for each node. This will allow for efficient lookup and update of values during the DFS traversal.

The recursive function could take three parameters: the current node, its parent, and the memoization dictionary. The function would recursively traverse the tree, updating the memoization dictionary at each step based on the parent-child relationships and the range values of the nodes.

The base case for the recursion would be when the current node has no children (i.e., it is a leaf node), in which case the minimum value to add to all nodes in its subtree would simply be the range value of the node itself. For non-leaf nodes, the minimum value to add to all nodes in their subtrees would be the sum of the minimum values for each child node, plus any additional value needed to reach the parent's range.

Finally, the main function could initiate the DFS traversal from the root node, and return the minimum value that needs to be added to all nodes in the entire tree (which would be stored in the memoization dictionary).
