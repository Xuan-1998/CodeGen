===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying tabulation or memoization to find the minimum number of operations needed.

DP state could be a 2D array, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its range [l_i, r_i].

The problem can be viewed as finding the shortest path from each vertex to the root in a weighted graph. Use dynamic programming with memoization to keep track of the shortest paths and the minimum number of operations needed to adjust each vertex's value.

Memoize the dynamic programming function using recursion with memoization dictionary. For each vertex, calculate the minimum number of operations needed by considering all its ancestors and their corresponding ranges. If an ancestor's range is completely within the current vertex's range, no operation is needed; otherwise, add the difference between the ancestor's maximum value and the current vertex's range to the total operations.

To further optimize the dynamic programming function, consider a more efficient data structure for storing and retrieving memoized values. A dictionary or hash map would be suitable, as it allows constant-time lookups by key (vertex index).

Finally, consider handling edge cases, such as vertices with no ancestors (i.e., leaf nodes) or vertices with identical ranges to their parents.
