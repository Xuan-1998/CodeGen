===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying tabulation or memoization to find the minimum number of operations needed.

Another option is to define state as a 2D array, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its j-th possible value in the range [l_i, r_i], considering all ancestors of vertex i have already been processed and only considering the current value is within the range.

To calculate dp[i][j], we can iterate over each ancestor k of vertex i and calculate the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its j-th possible value in the range [l_i, r_i] considering all ancestors up to k have already been processed. This calculation can be further simplified by noticing that we only need to consider values from l_i to min(j, r_i) because the value cannot exceed r_i.

We can memoize this function and use dynamic programming to solve the problem.

Finally, we return dp[n-1][0] as the minimum number of operations needed to adjust the root's value to its range [l_n, r_n].
