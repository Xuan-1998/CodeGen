===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem seems to be related to a tree data structure, so consider using memoized DFS to explore the tree and optimize the solution.

Consider initializing an array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to adjust all values in subtree rooted at node i such that all values are within range [l_i, r_i], given that the maximum value that needs to be subtracted is j. The base case would be when the current node has no children, and the solution is simply the range value of the node itself.

To fill up the dp array, iterate over each node i in the tree, and for each possible maximum subtracted value k from 0 to r_i - l_i:

* If the current node has no children, update dp[i][k] with k.
* Otherwise, consider all its children j, and recursively calculate dp[j][max(0, min(k, r_j - l_j))]. Then, update dp[i][k] as the minimum of its current value and the sum of 1 plus the minimum number of operations required for each child j.

Utilize tabulation by defining a 2D table where rows represent nodes in the tree, columns represent the possible maximum subtracted values, and cell values store the minimum number of operations required for each node at a given maximum value.
