===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoized DFS to explore the tree and optimize the solution.

The state expression could be the minimum number of operations needed to adjust all nodes in the subtree rooted at a given node, with the root node as the starting point. The base case would be when the current node has no children, and the solution is simply 0 because we don't need any operations for this node.

Determine if there's a connection between the range of values for each node and its ancestors/children, allowing us to deduce properties of subtrees based on the ranges of their nodes. This could help in calculating the minimum number of operations needed for each subtree.

Use memoized DFS to explore the tree and optimize the solution by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when possible.

For each node, calculate the minimum number of operations needed by considering its own range value and the ranges of its ancestors. For nodes that are not leaves (i.e., they have children), recursively calculate the minimum number of operations for their subtrees and add the number of operations needed to adjust this node's value within its range.

The final solution would be the sum of the minimum number of operations needed for each subtree rooted at each node in the tree.
