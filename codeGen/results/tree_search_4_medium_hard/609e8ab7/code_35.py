===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying dynamic programming to find the minimum number of operations needed.
To improve the plan:
* For each node in the DAG, calculate its range of possible values that can be achieved by performing operations on its ancestors.
* Start from the leaf nodes (vertices with no children) and move towards the root. At each step, update the ranges of child vertices based on their parent's updated range.
* Add a base case where if the node's value is within its allowed range, it doesn't need any operations.
* Handle edge cases by checking for them before starting the dynamic programming approach.

Potential solutions:
* Create a dictionary to store the minimum number of operations needed for each node. Start from the root and move towards the leaf nodes.
* For each node, calculate its range of possible values that can be achieved by performing operations on its ancestors. Update the node's value based on this calculated range.

Here is the updated plan:
