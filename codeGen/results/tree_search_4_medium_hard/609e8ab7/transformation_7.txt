===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoized DFS to explore the tree and optimize the solution.

The state expression could be the minimum value that needs to be added to all nodes in the subtree rooted at a given node, with the root node as the starting point. The base case would be when the current node has no children, and the solution is simply the range value of the node itself.

The state could be a tuple containing the minimum value that needs to be added to all nodes in the subtree rooted at a given node, along with the parent of that node. The base case would be when the current node has no children, and the solution is simply the range value of the node itself.

Consider implementing a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where you start with the leaf nodes and work your way up the tree, updating the states as you go.

The memoization table could store tuples of (node, parent), mapping to the minimum value that needs to be added to all nodes in the subtree rooted at that node. This would allow for efficient lookups when calculating the state for a given node.

To ensure the correctness of the solution, consider adding edge cases and testing scenarios to validate the logic.
