===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying tabulation or memoization to find the minimum number of operations needed.

The base case could be when i is equal to n, and there are no more vertices to process. This ensures that we only consider valid states in our dynamic programming solution.

The state could represent the current vertex being processed, and the transition relationship involves updating the state based on the values required for the current vertex's range, as well as recursively processing child nodes.

Develop an iterative approach using a queue data structure to process vertices in topological order. This ensures that we visit each node only once and avoids any potential issues with circular dependencies between states.

To further optimize our dynamic programming solution, consider maintaining a cache or memoization table to store the results of subproblems. This can help us avoid redundant computation and reduce the overall time complexity of our algorithm.
