===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a tree where each node represents a vertex. Define dp[i] as the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its range [l_i, r_i]. The state transition would be based on the values of the ancestors of vertex i and the values of the children of vertex i.

For each vertex i, calculate the minimum number of operations needed to adjust its value to its range [l_i, r_i] considering only its own value and the values of its descendants. This can be done by iterating over all possible values for vertex i's value within its range [l_i, r_i] and counting the number of operations needed to adjust its ancestors' values to their respective ranges.

To avoid redundant calculations, use memoization or tabulation to store the minimum number of operations needed to adjust each vertex's value to its range. This can be done by initializing a 2D array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to j within its range [l_i, r_i].

The base case for the state transition would be when vertex i has no children (i.e., it is a leaf node). In this case, the minimum number of operations needed to adjust its value to its range would simply be 0 if its current value is already within its range, and 1 if its current value is not.

For non-leaf nodes, calculate the minimum number of operations needed to adjust their values to their ranges by considering only their own value and the values of their children. This can be done by iterating over all possible values for each child vertex's value and counting the number of operations needed to adjust its ancestors' values to their respective ranges.

Finally, return the minimum number of operations needed to adjust the root node's value to its range as the overall minimum number of operations.
