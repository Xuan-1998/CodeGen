===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem seems to be related to a tree data structure, so consider using memoized DFS to explore the tree and optimize the solution.

The state expression could be dp[node] = min_operations required to adjust all vertices at node node, with the root node as the starting point. The base case would be when the current node has no children, and the solution is simply 0.

To consider each node's value adjustment as a separate state with its own set of transitions; for example, one transition could be 'add this value to all descendants' and another could be 'adjust by this value and then recursively apply the same operation to children'.

Employing a recursive memoization approach where dp[node] is computed by considering its own value adjustment as well as the adjustments required for its children, and storing the results in a dictionary to avoid re-computation.

For each node, calculate the minimum number of operations required to adjust all vertices at that node. This can be done by considering all possible values within the given range and selecting the one that requires the fewest operations.

Consider edge cases: what if the root node's value is already in its range? What if a node has multiple children? How do you handle these scenarios?

Update the state expression to account for the parent-child relationship. For each node, calculate the minimum number of operations required to adjust all vertices at that node by considering the adjustments required for its children.

The updated plan should look like this:
