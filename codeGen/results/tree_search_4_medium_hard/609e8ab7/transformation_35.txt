===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying tabulation or memoization to find the minimum number of operations needed.

To improve the plan:
* For each node in the DAG, calculate the range of possible values that can be achieved by performing operations on its ancestors.
* Start from the leaf nodes (vertices with no children) and move towards the root. At each step, update the ranges of the child vertices based on their parent's updated range.

Potential issues:
* The plan doesn't account for when a vertex is already within its allowed range, so it would still try to perform operations even though that's unnecessary.
* The plan doesn't handle edge cases such as when all vertices are already within their allowed ranges or when the root vertex needs no operations at all.

To address these issues:
* Add a base case where if the node's value is within its range, it doesn't need any operations.
* Handle the edge cases by checking for them before starting the dynamic programming approach.

Here is the updated plan:
