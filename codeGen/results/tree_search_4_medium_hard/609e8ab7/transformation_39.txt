===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying tabulation or memoization to find the minimum number of operations needed.

Let dp[i][j] represent the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its j-th possible value in the range [l_i, r_i], considering all ancestors of vertex i have already been processed and only considering the current value is within the range. 

We can initialize dp[1][0] = 0 (no operation needed for root node), then iterate over all vertices and calculate the minimum number of operations for each node based on its children.

For each node i, we iterate over all possible values j in [l_i, r_i], considering whether it's possible to adjust vertex i's value to j by adding or subtracting a non-decreasing array of integers. If yes, then consider the minimum number of operations needed for its children (which are already processed) and add 1 operation.

This plan is correct, but there might be an issue with handling edge cases like when the range [l_i, r_i] contains only one value or when all possible values in [l_i, r_i] can be adjusted to their respective ranges without any additional operations. 

To handle these edge cases, we should consider whether the current node's value is already within its range and update dp[i][j] accordingly.

For example, if vertex i has a range [1, 2] and its value is 1, then we don't need to adjust it anymore.
