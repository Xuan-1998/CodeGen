===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying tabulation or memoization to find the minimum number of operations needed.

The base case could be when i is equal to n, and there are no more vertices to process.

You can define a state as the number of vertices that still need to be processed, along with the cumulative sum of the values needed for each vertex's range. The transition relationship could involve recursively exploring child nodes and updating the state based on the values required.

Utilize both tabulation and memoization by first filling up a 2D table using bottom-up dynamic programming, then using memoization to avoid redundant computations while computing the minimum number of operations for each vertex.

To improve this plan, consider using a more efficient data structure such as a priority queue or a segment tree to store the vertices and their required values, rather than a simple recursive function.

The plan seems correct in its approach, but it's important to make sure that edge cases are handled properly. For example, what happens when the range of a vertex is already satisfied by an ancestor? How will you handle this case?

Here's an updated version of the plan:
