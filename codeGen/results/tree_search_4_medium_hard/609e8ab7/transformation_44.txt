To validate the initial plan:
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying tabulation or memoization to find the minimum number of operations needed.

This approach is reasonable because it captures the recursive nature of the problem. Each vertex i has a range [l_i, r_i], and you need to adjust its value to this range considering all ancestors have already been processed.

Define state as a 1D array, where dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its range [l_i, r_i], considering all ancestors of vertex i have already been processed.

This is a good start because it defines the state space and what each state (dp[i]) means. However, you should specify how these states relate to each other, i.e., how dp[i] is influenced by dp[j] for j < i.

Define state as a 1D array, where dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its range [l_i, r_i], considering all ancestors of vertex i have already been processed, and use a recursive function with memoization to store intermediate results.

This is correct because you can apply memoization to avoid redundant computations. However, it would be better to first develop the base cases for the recurrence relation and then discuss how you plan to apply memoization to make the algorithm more efficient.

Use a recursive function with memoization to store intermediate results.

This step makes sense, but be sure to specify what kind of memoization you will use (e.g., top-down or bottom-up) and how you will ensure that your solution does not exceed the time limit for competitive programming.

Edge cases:
To improve this plan, consider adding more specific details about the edge cases. For example, what happens when a vertex has no ancestors? How do you handle the root node?
