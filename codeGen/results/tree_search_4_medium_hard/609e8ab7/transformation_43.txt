===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying dynamic programming to find the minimum number of operations needed.

Define state as a 1D array, where dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its range [l_i, r_i], considering all ancestors of vertex i have already been processed. 

The base case is when vertex i has no ancestors or its ancestors' values are within their respective ranges.

For each vertex i, calculate dp[i] as the minimum of two cases:
- If all ancestors of vertex i have already had their values adjusted to their ranges (dp[parent(i)] = 0), then consider the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its range [l_i, r_i].
- Otherwise, consider adding some positive or negative value to vertex i's parent and adjusting its value to its range. The maximum additional value that can be added is the difference between r_parent and l_parent.

Apply memoization to store intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.
Use a recursive function with memoization to calculate dp[i].
