===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem seems to be related to a tree data structure, so consider using memoized DFS to explore the tree and optimize the solution.

The state expression could be the minimum number of operations required to adjust all vertices at a given node, with the root node as the starting point. The base case would be when the current node has no children, and the solution is simply 0.

To view each node's adjustment as a function of its parent's adjustment, essentially considering the root node as the base case and propagating down the tree. This could involve maintaining some sort of memoized parent-child relationship.

Employ an iterative DFS approach using a queue and a dictionary to store the node's adjustment, updating the state as you visit each node.

Consider storing the parent's adjustment in the memoized dictionary for later use when visiting child nodes.

To avoid revisiting nodes that have already been processed, maintain a set of visited nodes.

When processing each node, calculate its minimum number of operations by considering all possible adjustments from its children and then updating the current node's state based on this information.
