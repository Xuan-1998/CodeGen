===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying tabulation or memoization to find the minimum number of operations needed.

Define state as a 1D array, where dp[i] represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its range [l_i, r_i], considering all ancestors of vertex i have already been processed.
Consider using dynamic programming with bottom-up approach. Initialize dp[0] = 0 and then for each vertex i, calculate dp[i] as the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value given that all vertices below it (i.e., in its subtree) are adjusted.

Use a recursive function with memoization to store intermediate results. This can be done by using a bottom-up approach, starting from the leaves and working towards the root.
