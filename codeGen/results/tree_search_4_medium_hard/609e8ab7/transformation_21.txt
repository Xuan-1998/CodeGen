===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying tabulation or memoization to find the minimum number of operations needed.

DP state could be a 2D array, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its range [l_i, j]. This is because we want to consider all possible values from l_i to r_i for each vertex.

Consider a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its range [l_1, j]. The state transition would be based on the values of the ancestors of vertex i. For each vertex i and target value j, we can update dp[i][j] by considering all possible values for vertex i's parent p_i. We then update dp[i][j] with the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its range [l_p_i, j].

Using a 2D array with a size of n x (r_max - l_min + 1) and initializing dp[i][j] = inf for all i, j. This ensures that we consider all possible values for each vertex.

When processing the vertices in order from leaves to root, we can update the dp array accordingly. For leaf nodes, we set dp[i][l_i] = 0 because no operations are needed to adjust its value to its range [l_i, r_i].

The edge cases would be handling the root node and initializing the dp array for it.
