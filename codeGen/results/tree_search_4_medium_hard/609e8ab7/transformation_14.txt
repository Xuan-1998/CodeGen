===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using memoized DFS to explore the tree and optimize the solution.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of operations needed to adjust all nodes in subtree rooted at node i, such that the maximum value is j. The base case would be when the current node has no children, and the solution is simply 0 (no operations needed).

Consider using a 2D DP table where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust all nodes in subtree rooted at node i, such that the maximum value is j.

When calculating the minimum number of operations for each node, consider finding the maximum and minimum values within the range [l, r] and then calculate the differences between these values and the values of the ancestors. This would help determine the minimum number of operations needed to adjust all nodes in the subtree rooted at the current node.

Apply memoization to a recursive DFS function that calculates the minimum number of operations for each node in the tree.

When calculating the minimum number of operations, consider considering the range [l, r] and calculate the differences between these values and the values of the ancestors. This would help determine the minimum number of operations needed to adjust all nodes in the subtree rooted at the current node.

For edge cases, consider handling when a node has no children (i.e., it is a leaf node) or when the range [l, r] does not overlap with the value of the current node.
