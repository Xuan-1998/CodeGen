===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem seems to be related to a tree data structure, so consider using memoized DFS to explore the tree and optimize the solution.

The state expression could be the number of operations required to adjust all vertices at a given node, with the root node as the starting point. The base case would be when the current node has no children, and the solution is simply 0.

To consider each node's value adjustment as a separate state with its own set of transitions; for example, one transition could be 'add this value to all descendants' and another could be 'adjust by this value and then recursively apply the same operation to children'.

Implementing a dynamic programming table with states representing node values and transitions based on adding or adjusting the value at each node.

Consider implementing a separate memoized DFS function for calculating the minimum number of operations required to adjust each node's value, which would be used as a sub-routine in the main dynamic programming loop. This would allow for efficient calculation of the optimal solution.

Also, consider using a priority queue or a binary heap to efficiently store and retrieve nodes based on their values, allowing for faster computation of the minimum number of operations required.

Edge cases to consider include:
- When there is only one node in the tree
- When all node values are already within their respective ranges

This plan seems correct and provides a good starting point. The main potential issue with this plan is that it may not be efficient enough, especially for large trees, without further optimization.
