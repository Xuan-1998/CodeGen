===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider modeling the problem as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and applying dynamic programming to find the minimum number of operations needed.

The DP state could be a 2D array, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its range [l_i, r_i]. Initialize dp with infinite values for all vertices.

Model the problem as a tree where each node represents a vertex. Define dp[i] as the minimum number of operations needed to adjust vertex i's value to its range [l_i, r_i].

State transition would be based on the values of the ancestors of vertex i and the values of the children of vertex i. For each vertex i:

1. If the value of vertex i is within its range [l_i, r_i], then dp[i] = 0.
2. Otherwise, consider all possible arrays that can be added to adjust the value of vertex i to its range. For each array, calculate the minimum number of operations needed to add it to the ancestors of vertex i and the children of vertex i.

Use this DP state and implement tabulation:

1. Initialize dp with infinite values for all vertices.
2. Iterate over all vertices in topological order (starting from the root).
3. For each vertex i, calculate dp[i] based on the values of its ancestors and children.
4. Finally, return dp[1], which represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust the value of the root to its range.
