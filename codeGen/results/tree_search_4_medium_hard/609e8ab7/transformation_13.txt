===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem seems to be related to a tree data structure, so consider using memoized DFS to explore the tree and optimize the solution.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] representing the minimum number of operations needed to adjust all nodes in subtree rooted at node i, such that the maximum value is j. The base case would be when the current node has no children, and the solution is simply the range value of the node itself.

Consider using a 2D DP table where each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to adjust all nodes in subtree rooted at node i, such that the maximum value is j. Implement tabulation by using a 1D array to store the state values and perform calculations iteratively from the leaves to the root.

The updated DP table would be used as follows:
- For each leaf node i, set dp[i][r_i-l_i] = 0 (base case)
- For each non-leaf node i:
    - Calculate the maximum value that needs to be subtracted from all nodes in subtree rooted at node i
    - Set dp[i][j] as the minimum of the following two cases: 
        + The minimum number of operations needed to adjust all nodes in left subtree, plus 1 for the current node
        + The minimum number of operations needed to adjust all nodes in right subtree, plus 1 for the current node and any ancestors that need to be adjusted

The final answer would be stored at dp[1][r_1-l_1]
