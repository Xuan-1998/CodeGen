===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming problem seems to be related to a tree data structure, so consider using memoized DFS to explore the tree and optimize the solution.

The state expression could be the number of operations required to adjust all vertices at a given node, with the root node as the starting point. The base case would be when the current node has no children, and the solution is simply 0.

To view each node's adjustment as a function of its parent's adjustment, essentially considering the root node as the base case and propagating down the tree. This could involve maintaining some sort of memoized parent-child relationship.

Implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by first computing the minimum number of operations for all leaf nodes, then iteratively propagating this information up the tree using a priority queue or heap to efficiently handle nodes with multiple children.

For each node, consider the minimum number of operations required to adjust its value and that of its ancestors on the path to the root. This could be calculated by adding the adjustment needed for its parent node (if it exists) and the adjustment needed for itself.

When propagating information up the tree, prioritize nodes with no children first, since they only depend on their parent's state. Then move on to nodes with children, where each child depends on its own state as well as that of its siblings.
