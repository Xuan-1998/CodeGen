===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use recursion to break down the problem into smaller subproblems, and then use memoization to store the results and avoid redundant computations.

The state can be represented as the number of upper hemispheres with radius U_i. The base case is when i is 0.
State: s where s is the set of unique upper hemisphere radii.
Transition relationship:
    dp[s] = product(choose(N, |s|))
where choose(n, k) is the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items.

We need to consider that the order of the hemispheres matters. For example, [1, 2, 3] and [3, 2, 1] are considered different sequences.
To avoid counting the same sequence multiple times, we can sort s before computing dp[s].

Memoization:
    Use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computations.

Some edge cases to consider:
    When N is 0 or M is 0, there's only one way to build an empty X-sequence.
    When C is 1, there's only one way to build each possible sequence (i.e., all sequences are the same).
