===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use recursion with memoization to break down the problem into smaller subproblems and avoid redundant computations.
The state can be represented as the number of upper hemispheres left, the number of lower hemispheres left, and the count of different radii used so far. The base case is when there are no more spheres (n = 0 or m = 0).
State: dp[n][m][k] where n is the number of upper hemispheres left, m is the number of lower hemispheres left, and k is the count of different radii used so far.

Initially, we set up a 3D array dp[...][...][...] with size N+1 × M+1 × C+1 filled with zeros.
We fill this array in a bottom-up manner using the transition relationship:
dp[n][m][k] = sum(dp[n-1][m][k-1] * (U_n == i)) for i from 1 to C
This represents the number of ways to build sequences of X up to length n, with the last sphere having radius i.
The final answer is stored in dp[N][M][C], which corresponds to the number of different X-sequences that can be built.

Note: The initial plan does not handle edge cases. It would be necessary to add checks for N or M being 0, and also for k exceeding C.
