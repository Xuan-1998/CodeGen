We can use dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem.

The state can be represented as a tuple (i, j) where i represents the number of upper hemispheres and j represents the number of lower hemispheres. The base case is when i or j is 0.

The transition relationship can be formulated as dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k]) for k from 0 to min(i, j) if (i, j) not in memo, otherwise return memo[(i, j)].

To initialize the dynamic programming table, we need to calculate the number of ways to build sequences for all possible combinations of upper and lower hemispheres. This can be done by iterating over all possible values of i and j, and then using the transition relationship to update the value of dp[i][j].

Finally, the answer is the sum of all values in the last row of the dynamic programming table.
