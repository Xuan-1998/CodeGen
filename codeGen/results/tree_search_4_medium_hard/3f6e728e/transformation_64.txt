===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem efficiently. Here's an updated and refined plan:

State: (i, j) where i is the number of upper hemispheres with radius U_i and j is the number of lower hemispheres with radius L_j.
The base case is when both N and M are 0, which has a result of 1.

Transition relationship:
- If i > 0 and j > 0, then dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][0] + dp[0][j-1]) * (dp[i-1][j-1] if U_i == L_j else 0)
- If i > 0 and j == 0, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][0]
- If i == 0 and j > 0, then dp[i][j] = dp[0][j-1]

Memoization:
We can implement memoization using a recursive function that takes the state as an argument and returns the result. We'll use a dictionary to store the intermediate results.

Edge cases:
- N = M = 0: return 1
- N > 0, M == 0: return dp[N][0]
- N == 0, M > 0: return dp[0][M]

This plan takes into account all possible edge cases and transition relationships. Memoization helps to avoid redundant computations, making the solution more efficient.
