We can use dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem.

The state can be represented as the count of different radii used so far (k). The base case is when k is 0, in which case there is only one way to build an X-sequence (which is to not include any spheres).

State: k where k is the count of different radii used so far.

Transition relationship:
- dp[0] = 1
- dp[k] = sum(dp[i] * C - i) for i from 1 to min(k, C)
- The transition function considers all possible ways to use the upper and lower hemispheres with radii up to k. For each radius, it counts the number of ways to build an X-sequence using this radius (which is C - i), and multiplies this by the number of ways to build an X-sequence using the previous radii (dp[i]).

Create a recursive function with dictionary-based memoization mechanism to avoid redundant computations and store the results in a way that allows for efficient lookups. This can be implemented as follows:

- Initialize a dictionary dp with default value 0.
- Define a recursive function build_dp(k) that returns the number of ways to build an X-sequence using k different radii.
- In the function, check if the result is already in the dictionary. If it is, return the cached result.
- Otherwise, calculate the result using the transition relationship and store it in the dictionary before returning.

This approach avoids redundant computations by storing the results of subproblems in a way that allows for efficient lookups.
