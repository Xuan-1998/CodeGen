===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use recursion to break down the problem into smaller subproblems, and then use memoization to store the results and avoid redundant computations.

The state can be represented as a tuple (i, j) where i is the number of upper hemispheres with radius U_i and j is the number of lower hemispheres with radius L_j. The base case is when both N and M are 0.

State: (i, j) where i is the number of upper hemispheres with radius U_i and j is the number of lower hemispheres with radius L_j.
Transition relationship can be formulated as dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][j] for k in range(i)) * sum(dp[i][l] for l in range(j)).
Implement memoization using a dictionary memo to store the results of subproblems, where memo[(i, j)] returns the result of the subproblem (i, j).
The final answer can be computed by summing up all dp[N][M].

We need to handle edge cases where N or M is 0. In this case, we return 1.
