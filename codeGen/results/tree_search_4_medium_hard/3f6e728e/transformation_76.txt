===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use recursion to break down the problem into smaller subproblems, and then use memoization to store the results and avoid redundant computations.

The state can be represented as the number of upper hemispheres with radius U_i. The base case is when i is 0.

State: s where s is the set of unique upper hemisphere radii.
Transition relationship: dp[s] = product(choose(N, |s|)) where choose(n, k) is the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items.

Use top-down dynamic programming with recursion and memoization by defining a function dp(s) that calculates the number of X-sequences for a given set s of unique upper hemisphere radii.

However, we need to consider the constraints on the radii. For each upper hemisphere radius U_i, there must be at least one lower hemisphere with radius L_j such that j <= i.

We can use binary search to find the maximum index i such that all lower hemispheres with radius L_j where j <= i are of smaller or equal radius to U_i.

Then, we can calculate the number of X-sequences for each set s of unique upper hemisphere radii by iterating over all possible sets and calculating dp(s) recursively.

To avoid redundant computations, we can use memoization to store the results in a dictionary.

Finally, we return the sum of dp(s) for all sets s.
