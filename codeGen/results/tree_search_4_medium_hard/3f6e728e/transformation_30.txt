===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization can be used to solve the problem by storing the results of subproblems and reusing them when needed.

The state expression is dp[i][j]: the number of ways to build a sequence with exactly j spheres having radii up to i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ C and 0 ≤ j ≤ min(N, M).

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][min(j-1, m)] for k in range(1, i+1) if find_upper_hemisphere(k) <= j)

The state expression can be implemented using a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to build a sequence with exactly j spheres having radii up to i.

Let's analyze the plan step by step:

dp[0][j] = 1 for all 0 ≤ j ≤ min(N, M) since we can always start building a sequence from scratch

dp[i][0] = 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ C since there are no spheres to build with in an empty sequence

For 1 ≤ i ≤ C and 0 < j ≤ min(N, M), dp[i][j] is the sum of the number of ways to add a sphere at radius k to each of the sequences that can be built with exactly j-1 spheres having radii up to k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ i

To improve the plan:

* Use a more efficient data structure such as a hashmap or binary indexed tree for storing and querying dp values
* Implement memoization to store and reuse previously computed dp values

Potential issues with the plan:

* The plan assumes that find_upper_hemisphere(k) is O(1), which might not be the case if it involves searching through a large array or hash map. This could significantly slow down the program.
* The plan does not handle edge cases such as when N = 0, M = 0, or C = 0. It should check for these cases at the beginning of the program and return an appropriate result.
