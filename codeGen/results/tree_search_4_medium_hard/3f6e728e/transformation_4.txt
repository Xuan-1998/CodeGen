The proposed plan is mostly correct, but there are some potential issues that need to be addressed. Here's an updated and refined plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
We can solve this problem by using dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach.

The state expression could still be dp[i] = number of ways to build an i-sequence, where 1 ≤ i ≤ C.

dp[i] should be equal to the sum of dp[j] for all j such that j <= i and there exists an upper hemisphere with radius j and a lower hemisphere with radius i-j. However, we need to make sure that we don't count duplicate combinations of hemispheres.

We can do this by sorting the radii of the upper and lower hemispheres before filling up the dp table. This way, we ensure that we only consider unique combinations of hemispheres for each i-sequence.

Implement memoization by storing the computed values in a dictionary and looking them up when needed. This will help us avoid redundant computations.

To further improve the plan, we could sort the radii of the upper and lower hemispheres in descending order before filling up the dp table. This would help us avoid unnecessary iterations over the radii.

Finally, to handle edge cases, we should ensure that our base case (i.e., i = 0) is properly handled. In this case, dp[0] could be set to 1, since there's only one way to build a 0-sequence (which consists of no hemispheres).
