===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach, where we fill up a table in a systematic way.

The state expression could be dp[i] = number of ways to build an i-sequence, where 1 ≤ i ≤ C. 

dp[i] represents the number of ways to build a sequence of spheres with radii from 1 to i.

Use a dynamic programming table dp with size C+1, where:

    - Initialize dp[0] as 1 (base case), since there is only one way to build an empty sequence.
    - For each i from 1 to C:
        * Calculate the number of ways to extend an (i-1)-sequence by adding a new sphere with radius i, considering all possible upper and lower hemispheres. 
        * Update dp[i] as the sum of these counts.

This plan can be improved by:

    - Using a hashmap to store the frequency of each radius, which will reduce the time complexity of the calculation.
    - Implementing memoization to avoid recalculating the same subproblem multiple times.

Potential issues with the plan include:
    - It might not handle edge cases correctly (e.g., what if C = 0 or both N and M are 0?).
    - The dynamic programming table size might be too large, causing memory issues.
