===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization can be used to solve the problem by storing the results of subproblems and reusing them when needed.
dp[0][j] = 1 (no sphere) and dp[C+1][j] = 0 (sequences longer than C are not possible).
The state is dp[i][j], where i is the number of spheres in the sequence, and j is the maximum radius of the spheres.
The transition relationship is that for each sphere, we either add a new sphere with its radius or reuse an existing sphere with a smaller radius.
dp[i][j] can be calculated as the sum of dp[k][i-1] for all k such that U_k <= j and L_1 <= j <= C. This is because for each sequence, we either add a new sphere with its radius or reuse an existing sphere with a smaller radius.

We need to ensure that our dynamic programming table is filled in correctly by iterating over the spheres of upper hemispheres first, and then the lower hemispheres.
To avoid calculating the same subproblem multiple times, we can sort the upper and lower hemisphere radii first.
