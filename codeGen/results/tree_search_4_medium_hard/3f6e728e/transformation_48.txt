Memoization can be used to solve the problem by storing the results of subproblems and reusing them when needed.

The state expression is dp[i]: the number of ways to build a sequence with exactly i spheres having radii up to i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ C.
dp[0] = 1 (base case)
for i from 1 to C:
    dp[i] = sum(dp[j] * binomial(N-j+M-i-1, M-i) for j in range(i)), 
    where N-j+M-i is the remaining number of spheres that can be used to form an i-sequence
dp[i] %= MOD (to avoid overflow)

The dynamic programming approach creates a 2D array dp[][] where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to build a sequence with exactly i spheres having radii up to j.
For each cell in the dp table, calculate the value using the state expression and store it. This will ensure that subproblems are solved only once.
