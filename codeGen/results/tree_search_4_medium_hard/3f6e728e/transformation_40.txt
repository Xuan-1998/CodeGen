===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[0][j] = 1 (no sphere) and dp[C+1][j] = 0 (sequences longer than C are not possible).
The state is dp[i][j], where i is the number of spheres in the sequence, and j is the maximum radius of the spheres.
The transition relationship is that for each sphere, we either add a new sphere with its radius or reuse an existing sphere with a smaller radius.
Memoization can be used to store the results of subproblems and reusing them when needed; 
dp[i][j] can be calculated as 1 if i==0 or j==0, otherwise it's the sum of all dp[k][i-1] for k ranging from U_k to L_j.
This is because for each sequence, we either add a new sphere with its radius or reuse an existing sphere with a smaller radius.
The final answer will be the sum of all dp[C][j] for j ranging from 1 to C.
