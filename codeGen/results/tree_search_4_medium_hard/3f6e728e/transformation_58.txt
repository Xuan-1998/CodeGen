===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[0] = 1 (no sphere) and dp[C+1] = 0 (sequences longer than C are not possible).
dp[i] = (product of all ways to build sequences for upper hemispheres with radius i)
       + (sum of products of all ways to build sequences for lower hemispheres with radius j, where j from 1 to C and j != i)
Memoization can be used to store the results of subproblems and reusing them when needed.
Use a recursive function to update the state by adding the product of the number of ways to build sequences for the upper and lower hemispheres.
