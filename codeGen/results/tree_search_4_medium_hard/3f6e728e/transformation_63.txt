===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem efficiently.

The state can be represented as (i, j) where i is the number of upper hemispheres and j is the number of lower hemispheres. The base case is when both N and M are 0.
State: (i, j) where i is the number of upper hemispheres and j is the number of lower hemispheres.

The transition relationship can be formulated as follows:

* If there are no upper or lower hemispheres left to place, then dp[i][j] = 1 because we have found one way to build an X-sequence.
* If i > 0 and j = 0, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][0] because we can place the next upper hemisphere with radius U_i.
* If i = 0 and j > 0, then dp[i][j] = dp[0][j-1] because we can place the next lower hemisphere with radius L_j.
* If both i and j are greater than 0, then dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][0] + dp[0][j-1]) * dp[i-1][j-1] because we have two options: either place an upper or a lower hemisphere.

We can use a dynamic programming table (2D array) where the rows represent the number of upper hemispheres and the columns represent the number of lower hemispheres, and initialize the table with 0 values.
For each cell in the table, we calculate its value based on the transition relationship above.

Finally, the answer is the value at cell dp[N][M] modulo 10^9+7.

This plan correctly captures the essence of the problem. To improve it, we can consider storing the memoized results modulo 10^9+7 from the beginning to avoid overflow when calculating the values in the table.
