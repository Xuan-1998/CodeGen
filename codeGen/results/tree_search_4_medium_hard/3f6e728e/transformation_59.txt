===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. The state can be represented as a tuple (i, j) where i is the number of upper hemispheres with radius U_i and j is the number of lower hemispheres with radius L_j.

State: (i, j) where i is the number of upper hemispheres with radius U_i and j is the number of lower hemispheres with radius L_j. The transition relationship can be formulated as:

dp[i][j] = dp[0][j-1] * sum(dp[k][j] for k in range(i)) * (L_0 <= max(U_1, ..., U_i) and j > 0)

Base case: dp[0][0] = 1

Use a 2D array dp of size (N+1) x (M+1) to store the results of subproblems, where dp[i][j] represents the number of X-sequences that can be built with i upper hemispheres and j lower hemispheres.

Transition: for i in range(N+1):
    for j in range(M+1):
        if i > 0:
            dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][j] for k in range(i)) * (U_0 <= max(U_1, ..., U_i))
        else:
            dp[i][j] = dp[0][j-1]
dp[N][M]
