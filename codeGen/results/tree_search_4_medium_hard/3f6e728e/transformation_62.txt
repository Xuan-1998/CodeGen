===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem.

State: (i, j) where i is the number of upper hemispheres with radius U_i and j is the number of lower hemispheres with radius L_j.

The base case is when both N and M are 0, in which case there is only one way to build an X-sequence, which is an empty sequence. This can be represented as dp[0][0] = 1.

Transition relationship: dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][0] + dp[0][j-1]) * (dp[i-1][j-1] if i and j are greater than 0 else 1).

Create a dictionary-based memoization approach where the state is represented by a tuple of integers and the value is stored in the dictionary.

Initialization: dp = [[0]*(C+1) for _ in range(C+1)]

The recurrence relation can be implemented as follows:
for i in range(1, N+1):
    for j in range(1, M+1):
        if U_i == 1 or L_j == 1:
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][0] + dp[0][j-1]) * 1
        else:
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][0] + dp[0][j-1]) * (dp[i-1][j-1] if i and j are greater than 0 else 1)

Finally, the answer can be calculated as follows:
for c in range(C+1):
    print((dp[N][c] + dp[c][M]) % (10**9+7), end=" ")
print()
