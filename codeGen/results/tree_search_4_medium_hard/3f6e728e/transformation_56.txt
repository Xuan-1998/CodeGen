dp[0] = 1 (no sphere) and dp[C+1] = 0 (sequences longer than C are not possible).

Transition: For each upper hemisphere, consider all possible radii from 1 to C. 
For each lower hemisphere, consider all possible radii from 1 to C. 
Update the state by adding the product of the number of ways to build sequences for the upper and lower hemispheres.

dp[i] is the number of different X-sequences that can be built with i spheres in total.
