===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoization can be used to solve the problem by storing the results of subproblems and reusing them when needed.

dp[0][j] = 1 (no sphere) and dp[C+1][j] = 0 (sequences longer than C are not possible).

dp[i][j] = sum(dp[k][i-1] * (1 if U_k <= j else 0) for k in range(N)) + 
          sum(dp[k][i-1] * (1 if L_k <= j else 0) for k in range(M))

Memoization can be implemented using a dictionary to store intermediate results.

Initialize dp with zeros and calculate the values iteratively.
Calculate the values from bottom-up, starting from dp[0][j], then dp[1][j], ..., dp[C+1][j].
For each value of i and j, calculate dp[i][j] as described above.
Finally, print the last row (dp[C][j]) to get the desired output.
