Memoization can be used to solve the problem by storing the results of subproblems and reusing them when needed.

The state expression is dp[i]: the number of ways to build a sequence with exactly i spheres having radii up to i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ C.

dp[i] = sum(dp[j] * comb(N-j+M-i-1, M-i) for j in range(i)), where N-j+M-i is the remaining number of spheres that can be used to form an i-sequence

Another option is to implement memoization using a dictionary where the key is a tuple (N, M, i) and the value is the number of ways to build an i-sequence given N upper hemispheres and M lower hemispheres.

For edge cases, consider when N = 0 or M = 0. In this case, dp[i] should be initialized to 1 for all i, because there are no spheres available to form any sequence.

The plan can be improved by adding more details about the initialization of dp and the calculation of comb(N-j+M-i-1, M-i).
