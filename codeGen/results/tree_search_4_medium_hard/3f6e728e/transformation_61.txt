===BEGIN PLAN===
We can use recursion to break down the problem into smaller subproblems, and then use memoization to store the results and avoid redundant computations.

The state can be represented as a tuple (i, j) where i is the number of upper hemispheres with radius U_i and j is the number of lower hemispheres with radius L_j. The base case is when both N and M are 0, in which case there's only one way to build an X-sequence.

State: (i, j) where i is the number of upper hemispheres with radius U_i and j is the number of lower hemispheres with radius L_j.
Transition relationship can be formulated as:

dp[i][j] = (sum(dp[k][j] for k in range(i))) * (sum(dp[i][l] for l in range(j)))

We will use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing dp[0][0] = 1 and then filling up the dp array in a bottom-up manner using the transition relationship.

For edge cases, we can handle N or M being 0 separately. If either N or M is 0, there's only one way to build an X-sequence (when both are 0).

The plan includes all necessary steps and handles edge cases.
