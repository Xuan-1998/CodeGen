===BEGIN PLAN===
The top-down approach with memoization can be used by defining a recursive function that takes the current book and the remaining shelf width as input, and returns the minimum height of the bookcase for the given subproblem. The base case would be when there are no more books to place.

The state expression could be defined as dp[i][w], where dp[i][w] represents the minimum height of the bookcase after placing the first i books, given a remaining shelf width w.

To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can use a 2D table dp[i][w] to store the state. The dimensions of the table would be (i+1) x (w+1), where i ranges from 0 to n-1 (the number of books) and w ranges from 0 to shelfWidth.

The initial values for the base case (when there are no more books to place) can be set as follows:

* dp[0][w] = 0, for all w in range(0, shelfWidth+1)

Then, we can fill up the table using the following recurrence relation:

dp[i][w] = min(dp[i-1][max(0, w-t)], dp[i-1][w]),

where t is the thickness of the ith book.

Finally, we can return dp[n-1][shelfWidth] as the minimum height of the bookcase.
