"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given a sequence of books, each represented by a pair of integers indicating its thickness and height, and a maximum shelf width, place the books onto shelves of a bookcase in order to minimize the total height of the bookcase. Each shelf has a maximum width, and books can only be placed on a shelf if their combined thickness is less than or equal to the shelf width. The height of each shelf is determined by the tallest book placed on it. The order of the books must be maintained throughout the process.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of a list of books, where each book is represented by a pair of integers indicating its thickness and height. The input also includes the maximum width of each shelf. Input is provided through standard input.\\n\\nOutput: The output is a single integer representing the minimum possible height of the bookcase after placing the books on shelves in the described manner.\\n\\nConstraints: There can be at most 1000 books, each book's thickness and height are at most 1000, and the shelf width is at least as large as the thickness of any book and at most 1000.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Dynamic programming', 'Data structures']\", \"difficulties\": \"MEDIUM_HARD\", \"source\": \"leetcode\", \"url\": \"https://leetcode.com/problems/filling-bookcase-shelves/\", \"sample_test_cases\": []}"
