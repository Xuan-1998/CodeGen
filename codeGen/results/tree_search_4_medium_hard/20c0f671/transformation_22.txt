===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem.

Let dp[i][j] represent the minimum possible height of the bookcase after placing the first i books, where each shelf has a maximum width j.
dp[i][k] can be calculated as the minimum of two cases:
- If the current book (i) can be placed on the last shelf with width k, then its height is added to the height of the bookcase for the remaining shelves.
- If the current book (i) cannot be placed on the last shelf with width k, then it must start a new shelf, and we need to consider all possible books that can fit on this new shelf.

Memoize dp[i][j] using dictionary: dp = {0: 0}
The base case is when i is 0, in which case the minimum height of the bookcase is 0.
Initialize dp with 0: dp = [[0 for _ in range(max_width + 1)] for _ in range(len(books) + 1)]

For each book:
- For each shelf width from max_width down to the thickness of the current book:
    - If the book can fit on this shelf, calculate the minimum height considering all previous books.
    - If not, consider starting a new shelf and find the minimum height for this case.

Return dp[-1][-1] as the minimum possible height of the bookcase.
