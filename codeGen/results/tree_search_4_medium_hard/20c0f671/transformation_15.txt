===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[j][k] = minimum possible height of the bookcase after placing the first j books with a maximum shelf width k.

Create a 2D table dp with dimensions m x n, where m = number of books and n = maximum shelf width. Initialize all values in dp as infinity, except for dp[0][w] which is set to 0 (since no books are placed).

Fill the first row of dp by setting dp[i][k] as the height of the ith book for each shelf width k.

For each subsequent row i and column j:
    If the thickness of the ith book is less than or equal to the maximum shelf width, then consider two possibilities: place the ith book on a new shelf, or merge it with the (i-1)th book if it fits. Calculate the minimum height in both cases and update dp[i][j] accordingly.

Finally, return the minimum value in the last column of dp as the minimum possible height of the bookcase.
