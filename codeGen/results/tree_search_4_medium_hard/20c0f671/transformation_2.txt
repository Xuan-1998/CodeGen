===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[i][w] = min height of bookcase when i books are placed and w is the maximum shelf width.
dp[i][0] = max(heights[0], ..., heights[i-1]) if it's possible to place all the books on shelves with a width 0 (i.e., no shelves).

The main idea is to iterate over each book from left to right, considering all possible combinations of books that can be placed on the current shelf. For each combination, calculate the maximum height of the shelf and update dp[i][w] accordingly.

Here's the detailed plan:

1. Initialize a 2D array dp where dp[i][w] stores the minimum height of the bookcase for i books and maximum shelf width w.
2. Iterate over each book from left to right:
	* For each book, consider all possible combinations of books that can be placed on the current shelf (up to the current book).
	* Calculate the maximum height of the shelf for each combination by summing up the heights of the books in the combination.
	* Update dp[i][w] with the minimum height among all possible combinations.
3. Return dp[m][w], where m is the total number of books and w is the maximum shelf width.
