===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[i][w] = min height of bookcase when i books are placed and w is the maximum shelf width.
Update dp[i][w] to be the minimum of these two options:
  - Place the current book on a new shelf: dp[i-1][0] + book_height
  - Try to place the current book on an existing shelf: min(dp[i-1][max(0, w-book_thickness)], dp[i-1][w]) + book_height

This process continues until all books have been placed.
Finally, return the minimum height of the bookcase for the maximum shelf width.

===END PLAN===
