===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[j][k] = minimum possible height of the bookcase after placing the first j books with a maximum shelf width k.
dp[j][k] = min(dp[j-1][k], dp[i][w]) + maxBookHeight, where i < j and w <= k.

To avoid overcounting, we need to make sure that for each book, we only consider it being placed on the current shelf or a previous one. This can be achieved by iterating over the books in reverse order (j from 1 to n) and then for each book, iterate over all possible shelf widths k from maxBookWidth down to min(thickness of book, k).

The final answer will be dp[n][maxBookWidth].
