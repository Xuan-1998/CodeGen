===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[j][k] = minimum possible height of the bookcase after placing the first j books with a maximum shelf width k.

The base case is when there are no more books to place (j=0), in which case the minimum height of the bookcase is 0.

For each book i, calculate dp[i][w] as the minimum possible height of the bookcase after placing the first i books, where each book's thickness is less than or equal to w. This can be done by considering all previous shelves and choosing the one with the smallest maximum shelf width that does not exceed w.

Fill up the 2D array based on the given constraints, taking into account the order of the books and the maximum shelf width.

To minimize the total height of the bookcase, choose the minimum height from each column for each row, effectively finding the minimum possible height of the bookcase after placing all the books.
