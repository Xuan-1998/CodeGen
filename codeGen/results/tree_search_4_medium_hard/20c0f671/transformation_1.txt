===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[i][w] = min height of bookcase when i books are placed and w is the maximum shelf width.
dp[i][w] represents the minimum height of the bookcase when i books are placed and w is the maximum shelf width.

To initialize the table, iterate through all possible subproblems (i.e., 0 <= i <= n, 0 <= w <= max_shelf_width) and set dp[0][w] to 0 for all w, since placing no books will result in a height of 0.

For each book i, calculate its shelf position by iterating from the maximum shelf width down to 1. For each shelf position j, check if the current book can be placed on the jth shelf (i.e., if the combined thickness of the book and all previous books is less than or equal to w). If it can be placed, update dp[i][w] by choosing the minimum height between the current height and the height when the book is placed on the jth shelf. Use memoization by maintaining a dictionary memo where memo[(i, w)] = min height of bookcase when i books are placed and w is the maximum shelf width.

To calculate the final answer, return dp[n][max_shelf_width], which represents the minimum height of the bookcase when all n books are placed.
