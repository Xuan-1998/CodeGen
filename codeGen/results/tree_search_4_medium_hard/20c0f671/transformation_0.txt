===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[i][w] = min height of bookcase when i books are placed and w is the maximum shelf width.
dp[i][w] represents the minimum height of the bookcase when i books are placed and w is the maximum shelf width.

Create a 2D table dp where dp[i][w] stores the minimum height of the bookcase for i books and maximum shelf width w.

For each subproblem, iterate over all possible shelves (from 1 to w) and consider placing the current book on each shelf. If the combined thickness of the books on that shelf does not exceed the shelf width, update dp[i][w] with the minimum height of the bookcase for i-1 books and the remaining shelf width.

The base case is when there are no more books to place (i = 0), in which case the minimum height of the bookcase is 0.

Finally, return dp[n][m], where n is the total number of books and m is the maximum shelf width.
