===BEGIN PLAN===
The top-down approach with memoization can be used by defining a recursive function that takes the current book and the remaining shelf width as input, and returns the minimum height of the bookcase for the given subproblem. The base case would be when there are no more books to place.

The state expression could be defined as dp[i][w], where dp[i][w] represents the minimum height of the bookcase after placing the first i books, given a remaining shelf width w.

Memoize recursive function calls by storing intermediate results in a dictionary. This would avoid redundant calculations and improve the efficiency of the algorithm.

To further optimize the solution, consider sorting the books by their heights before processing them. This would allow us to place the tallest books on the bottom shelves first, which could lead to a more efficient packing strategy.

Edge cases should be handled carefully, including cases where there are no books to place (i.e., i = 0), and cases where all remaining shelf width is used up by a single book. In these cases, the minimum height would be the maximum height of any individual book or zero respectively.
