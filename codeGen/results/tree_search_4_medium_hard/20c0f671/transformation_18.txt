===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[j][k] = minimum possible height of the bookcase after placing the first j books with a maximum shelf width k.
dp[j][k] = min(dp[i][minW]) + maxBookHeight if i < j and w <= k
where i ranges from 0 to j-1, and w ranges from 0 to k.

The base case is dp[0][w] = 0 for all w, since there are no books.

Use dynamic programming with a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem.
Fill in the dp table by considering all possible combinations of placing books on shelves of width k.
Finally, return dp[n][m], where n is the total number of books and m is the maximum shelf width.
