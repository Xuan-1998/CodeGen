===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[i][w] = min height of bookcase when i books are placed and w is the maximum shelf width.

Let's consider placing the current book on a new shelf (dp[i][w]) or place it on top of an existing shelf (dp[i-1][max_width - book_thickness]).

Use tabulation by initializing a 2D array dp with dimensions len(books) x max_shelf_width and iteratively filling it up from bottom to top and left to right, considering all possible shelf combinations.

For each iteration:
    For each book i from len(books)-1 down to 0:
        For each shelf width w from max_shelf_width-1 down to 0:
            Calculate the minimum height of bookcase when placing the current book on a new shelf and updating dp[i][w]
            Update dp[i][w] with min(dp[i-1][max_width - book_thickness], dp[i-1][w]) + book_height
    Return dp[0][max_shelf_width]

This plan is correct, but it can be improved by using memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.

The potential issues with this plan are:
* What if there's no shelf that can accommodate the current book?
* How do we handle edge cases where i or w is 0?

Edge cases:
- If i is 0, it means we have already processed all books, so return dp[0][max_shelf_width]
- If w is 0, it means the current book cannot fit on any shelf, so return infinity
