===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table dp[][] to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books (0-indexed) and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.
The state expression is dp[i][w] = minimum possible height of the bookcase after placing the first i books with a maximum shelf width w.

The base case is dp[0][w] = 0 for all w, since there are no books to place on the shelves.

For each book i (from 1 to n-1), iterate through the possible maximum shelf widths w (from the thickness of the current book to the maximum shelf width). For each w:
    1. Initialize a variable max_height = 0 and a variable j = i.
    2. Iterate from k = 0 to w, updating max_height and j as follows: 
        - If dp[j-1][k] is not 0 (i.e., the previous books can be placed on shelves with width k), then:
            - Update j = j - 1 (since we've used up all available space) if k + book[i].thickness <= w, or
            - Update max_height = max(max_height, dp[j-1][k] + book[i].height)
        - If dp[j-1][k] is 0 (i.e., the previous books cannot be placed on shelves with width k), then:
            - Update j = i (since we start from scratch) and
            - Update max_height = max(max_height, book[i].height)
    3. Update dp[i][w] = min(dp[i-1][w], max_height).

The final answer is the minimum value in the last row of the dp[][] table.
