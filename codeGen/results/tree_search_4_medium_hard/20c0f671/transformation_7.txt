===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table dp[][] to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[i][w] = min height of bookcase when i books are placed and w is the maximum shelf width. We can update dp[i][w] to be the minimum of these two options, considering the height of the current book and the maximum shelf width:

1.  If the thickness of the current book is less than or equal to w, place it on the current shelf and update dp[i][w] to dp[i-1][w-thickness] + height.
2.  Otherwise, place a new shelf for this book and update dp[i][w] to min(dp[i-1][w], dp[j][w-thickness] + height), where j is such that dp[j][w-thickness] + height is minimum.

Memoization using a dictionary memo to store the results of subproblems as they are solved, and look up the solutions instead of recalculating them whenever needed.

Finally, return dp[n][max_shelf_width], where n is the total number of books.
