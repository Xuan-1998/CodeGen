===BEGIN PLAN===
The top-down approach with memoization can be used by defining a recursive function that takes the current book and the remaining shelf width as input, and returns the minimum height of the bookcase for the given subproblem. The base case would be when there are no more books to place.

The state expression could be defined as dp[i][w], where dp[i][w] represents the minimum height of the bookcase after placing the first i books, given a remaining shelf width w.

Let's define the recursive function as follows:

dp[i][w] = min(dp[j-1][w-book_thickness] + book_height | 0 <= j <= i and book_thickness + j * shelf_width <= w)

The base case would be when there are no more books to place, which is represented by dp[0][w].

The function should return the minimum height of the bookcase for the given subproblem.
