===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

State expression is dp[i][j] = the minimum possible height of the bookcase after placing the first i books, where each shelf has a maximum width j.
dp[i][j] could be the minimum possible height of the bookcase if we place the first i-1 books and then consider the last book. The shelf width is j.

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing the first row of the table with the height of each individual book, then iteratively update the rest of the table using previous results.

Update step: for i from 2 to n (where n is the number of books), and for j from max_thickness to shelf_width:
    If the last book's thickness is less than or equal to j:
        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-thickness] + height)
    Else:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]

Finally, return dp[n][shelf_width]
