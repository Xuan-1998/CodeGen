===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[i][w] = min height of bookcase when i books are placed and w is the maximum shelf width.

Let's consider placing the current book on a new shelf (dp[i][w]) or place it on top of an existing shelf (dp[i-1][max_width - book_thickness]).
We can use memoization to store the intermediate results in a dictionary.
The base case would be when there are no more books to place, and we simply return 0.

We fill up the dp array from bottom to top and left to right by considering all possible shelf combinations.
For each cell dp[i][w], we consider two options: 
- Place the current book on a new shelf (dp[i][w])
- Place it on top of an existing shelf (dp[i-1][max_width - book_thickness])

The recurrence relation would be:

dp[i][w] = min(1 + max(dp[j][w - thickness] for j in range(i)) if w >= thickness else 0, dp[i-1][w],)

The time complexity is O(n*m) where n is the number of books and m is the maximum shelf width.
The space complexity is also O(n*m) as we need to store the intermediate results.

This plan includes edge cases such as when there are no more books to place, or when the current book cannot fit on any existing shelf. It does not consider invalid inputs where the number of books exceeds the maximum shelf width, but this can be handled by adding error checking code.
