===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[i][w] = min height of bookcase when i books are placed and w is the maximum shelf width.
Transition: i increases by 1 and w either remains the same or decreases by the thickness of the current book.

Fill up the table dp row by row, using the following recurrence relation:

dp[i][w] = min(height + dp[j][w-thickness] for j=0 to i-1)

where height is the height of the ith book and j represents the number of books placed before the ith book on a shelf.

This approach guarantees an optimal solution because it considers all possible ways to place books on shelves.
The plan also covers edge cases, such as when there are no books or shelves left. For example, if i=0, dp[i][w] would be 0 for any w.
