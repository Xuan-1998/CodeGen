===BEGIN PLAN===
The dynamic programming approach can be used by defining a recursive function that takes the current book and the remaining shelf width as input, and returns the minimum height of the bookcase for the given subproblem.

Define the state expression as dp[i][w], where dp[i][w] represents the minimum total height of the bookcase after placing the first i books, given a maximum shelf width w.

The base case would be when there are no more books to place. In this case, the minimum height of the bookcase is 0.

To fill in the state expression, consider two options for each book: either place it on the current shelf or start a new shelf.

If placing the book on the current shelf does not exceed the maximum width, calculate the height of the bookcase by adding the height of the book to the minimum height calculated for the previous books with the remaining shelf width.

If starting a new shelf is necessary, calculate the height of the bookcase by adding the height of the book to the minimum height calculated for the previous books and then add the minimum height of the shelves that can be created after placing this book.

Update the state expression accordingly based on the calculated heights. This will ensure that the minimum total height of the bookcase is stored for each subproblem.

The plan includes edge cases such as when there are no more books to place.
