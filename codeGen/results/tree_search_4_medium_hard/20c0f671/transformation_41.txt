===BEGIN PLAN===
The top-down approach with memoization can be used by defining a recursive function that takes the current book and the remaining shelf width as input, and returns the minimum height of the bookcase for the given subproblem. The base case would be when there are no more books to place.

The state expression could be defined as dp[i][w], where dp[i][w] represents the minimum height of the bookcase after placing the first i books, given a remaining shelf width w.

The dynamic programming process would involve iterating over all possible subproblems (i.e., the number of books and the remaining shelf width) and recursively calculating the minimum height for each subproblem. The result would be stored in the dp[i][w] state expression to avoid redundant calculations.

Using dynamic programming with a 2D table, where dp[i][w] represents the minimum height of the bookcase after placing the first i books, given a remaining shelf width w.

The final solution would involve returning the value of dp[n][max_width], where n is the total number of books and max_width is the maximum shelf width.

This plan handles edge cases by considering all possible subproblems. However, it may be improved by using a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming instead of top-down recursion.
