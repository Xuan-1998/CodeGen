===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[i][w] = minimum possible height of the bookcase after placing the first i books with a maximum shelf width w.

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to fill the dp table by iterating over the books and shelf widths. For each book, iterate from the maximum shelf width down to its thickness (since it can only be placed on shelves with a width equal to or greater than its thickness). Update the dp[i][w] value based on whether the current book can be placed on a shelf of width w.

If the current book's thickness is less than or equal to w, update dp[i][w] with the maximum of the current minimum height and the height of the book plus the minimum height of the remaining books that can fit in the remaining shelf space (dp[i-1][w-b[0]]). Otherwise, set dp[i][w] to the value from the previous row dp[i-1][w].

Finally, return the minimum value across all columns of the last row (dp[n][w]) as the minimum possible height of the bookcase.
