===BEGIN PLAN===
The top-down approach with memoization can be used by defining a recursive function that takes the current book and the remaining shelf width as input, and returns the minimum height of the bookcase for the given subproblem. The base case would be when there are no more books to place.

Define the state expression as dp[i][w], where dp[i][w] represents the minimum total height of the bookcase after placing the first i books, given a maximum shelf width w.

The recursive function can be defined as follows:
- If it's the last book, return its height.
- For each possible position for the current book on the shelves, calculate the height of the bookcase and update dp[i][w] if necessary.
- Memoize the results to avoid redundant calculations.

To improve the plan, consider the following:
- Use a priority queue to sort books by their heights and place them on the shelves in non-decreasing order. This can help reduce the number of possible positions for each book.
- Consider using a dynamic programming approach instead of memoization if the recursive function is too complex or slow.

Edge cases should be considered, such as:
- If there are no more books to place, return 0.
- If the remaining shelf width is less than the thickness of the current book, skip it and move on to the next one.
