===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[i][w] = minimum possible height of the bookcase after placing the first i books with a maximum shelf width w.
dp[i][w] represents the minimum possible height of the bookcase after placing the first i books and the maximum shelf width is w.

To fill up this table, iterate over each pair (i, w) such that 1 <= i <= n (where n is the total number of books) and 0 <= w <= max_shelf_width. For each cell dp[i][w], calculate the minimum possible height by considering two options: either place the current book on an empty shelf or place it on top of the previous book, and update the cell with the minimum value.

Apply memoization using a dictionary to store intermediate results for repeated subproblems.

To finalize the result, return dp[n][max_shelf_width] as the minimum possible height of the bookcase after placing all books.
