===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table dp[][] to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

State expression is dp[i][j] = the minimum possible height of the bookcase after placing the first i books, where each shelf has a maximum width j.

dp[i][j] could be the minimum possible height of the bookcase if we place the first i-1 books and then consider the last book. The shelf width is j.
Let dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + max_book_height) where 0 <= k <= j, and max_book_height is the height of the ith book.

Start with dp[0][j] = 0 for all j. This represents the base case: when there are no books, the minimum height of the bookcase is 0.

Fill in dp[i][j] by iterating over each possible shelf width k from 0 to j.
For each shelf width k, calculate the minimum height of the bookcase if we place the ith book on a shelf with maximum width k. This is min(dp[i-1][k-1] + max_book_height) where dp[i-1][k-1] represents the minimum possible height of the bookcase after placing the first i-1 books, and max_book_height is the height of the ith book.

The final answer will be dp[n][j], where n is the total number of books and j is the maximum shelf width.
