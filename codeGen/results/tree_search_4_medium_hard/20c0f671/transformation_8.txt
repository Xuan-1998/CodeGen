===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[i][w] = min height of bookcase when i books are placed and w is the maximum shelf width. 

For each book from 0 to i-1:
    - For each possible shelf width w from max_thickness to w_shelf_width (from rightmost column to leftmost):
        - Calculate the minimum height of bookcase dp[i][w] by considering two options: 
            1) Place the current book on the top of the bookcase, and then try to place the remaining i-1 books on shelves with maximum width w.
            2) Do not place the current book on the top of the bookcase. Instead, place it on a shelf with maximum width less than or equal to its thickness. Then, try to place the remaining i-1 books on shelves with maximum width w.

Update dp[i][w] to be the minimum of these two options.
Tabulation by solving the problem from the bottom-up, starting with the smallest subproblem and working your way up to the original problem.
