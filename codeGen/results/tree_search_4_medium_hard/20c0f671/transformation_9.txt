===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[i][w] = min height of bookcase when i books are placed and w is the maximum shelf width.
Transition: i increases by 1 and w either remains the same or decreases by the thickness of the current book.

Create a table dp of size (n+1) x (m+1), where n is the number of books, m is the maximum shelf width.

For each cell dp[i][w], calculate the minimum height when i books are placed and w is the maximum shelf width.
This can be achieved by iterating through all possible shelf widths from m down to the current book's thickness and selecting the one that results in the minimum height.
If no book fits on the current shelf, set dp[i][w] to the value of the previous row (dp[i-1][w]), meaning the same shelf width is used.

The final answer is stored in dp[n][m].
