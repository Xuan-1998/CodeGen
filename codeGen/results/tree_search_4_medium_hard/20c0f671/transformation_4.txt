===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[i][w] = min height of bookcase when i books are placed and w is the maximum shelf width.
Let's consider placing the current book on a new shelf (dp[i][w]) or place it on top of an existing shelf (dp[i-1][max_width - book_thickness]).
Implement memoization using a dictionary dp where the key is a tuple (i, w) representing the current book index and maximum shelf width, and the value is the minimum height of the bookcase for that subproblem.

The base case is when i == 0, meaning no books are left to place. In this case, we return 0 as the minimum height.

To fill in the dp table, iterate over each book from left to right, and for each book:
1. Calculate the minimum height of placing it on a new shelf: dp[i][w] = min(height of current book, dp[i-1][max_width - book_thickness] + height of current book)
2. Update the maximum shelf width based on the thickness of the current book: max_width -= book_thickness
3. If w is less than or equal to 0, it means we can't place any more books and we should stop filling in the dp table.

The final answer is dp[-1][max_width], where -1 represents the last book index.
