===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[j][k] = minimum possible height of the bookcase after placing the first j books with a maximum shelf width k.

dp[j][k] = min(dp[i-1][min(k, w)] + maxBookHeight, dp[j-1][k]), where i < j and w <= k.
The outer loop iterates over each book (j), and the inner loop iterates over each possible shelf width (k). The minimum height of the bookcase is the minimum between the height of the previous book plus the maximum book height if it can fit on the current shelf, and the height of the previous books if it cannot.

To avoid calculating the same subproblem multiple times, memoization is used by storing intermediate results in a dictionary. This ensures that each subproblem is calculated only once.
