===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[j][k] = minimum possible height of the bookcase after placing the first j books with a maximum shelf width k.
dp[i][w] represents the minimum possible height of the bookcase after placing the first i books, where each book's thickness is less than or equal to w.

To fill the table, for each book and each possible shelf width:
- Calculate the height of the current book (height) and its thickness (thickness)
- Iterate over previous possible shelf widths (w' in [1..k])
- If the current book can be placed on a shelf with the maximum shelf width w', update dp[i][w] if it's less than or equal to the minimum height calculated so far
- For each possible shelf width, calculate the minimum height of the bookcase after placing the first i books and the maximum shelf width k

The final answer is the minimum value in the last row of the table (dp[n][k]), where n is the number of books.
