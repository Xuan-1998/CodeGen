===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing a 2D table to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem, where the rows represent the books and the columns represent the maximum shelf width.

The state expression is dp[i][w] = min height of bookcase when i books are placed and w is the maximum shelf width.
Transition: i increases by 1 and w either remains the same or decreases by the thickness of the current book, with a constraint that w cannot be less than the thickness of any book. This ensures that all shelves have enough space to hold at least one book.

Use memoization to store the minimum height of the bookcase for each subproblem and update it accordingly as you traverse through the problem.
The base case is when i = 0, in which case dp[i][w] is initialized to 0, representing the empty bookcase.
For the recursive case, consider the first k books. If the thickness of the current book is greater than w, we need to try the previous k-1 books on the same shelf width and add the height of the current book.

The optimal substructure is when i decreases by 1 and w either remains the same or increases by the thickness of the current book.
