===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure because the solution to the larger problem (n) is constructed from the solutions of smaller problems (i.e., the perfect squares that sum up to n).
Consider a base case: dp[0] = 0, because there are no perfect squares that sum up to 0.
dp[i] is the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i, and dp[i] = min(1 + dp[j]) for j in range(int(i**0.5)) + 1
This is because a perfect square less than or equal to i can be decomposed into the sum of smaller perfect squares.
The recursive function should check if i is a perfect square, and if so, return 1 as it requires only one perfect square to sum up to itself.
Otherwise, the function should recursively calculate dp[j] for j in range(int(i**0.5)) + 1 and add 1 to the minimum of these values.
Implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing an array with dp[0] = 0 and then iteratively updating dp[i] for i from 1 to n, using the above recursive function.
