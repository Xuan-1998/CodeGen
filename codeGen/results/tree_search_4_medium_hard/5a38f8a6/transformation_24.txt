===BEGIN PLAN===
It's more efficient to use a bottom-up approach with tabulation since we need to iterate through all possible combinations of perfect squares to find the minimum number.

The state expression is dp[i], where dp[i] represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i.
dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1 for j in range(0, int(i**0.5) + 1) if (j ** 2) <= i),

Utilize a list dp with size n+1, where:
    - dp[0] is initialized as 0, since the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to 0 is 0.
    - For j in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1), if (j ** 2) <= n:
        - If j is a perfect square, dp[j] is initialized as j.
        - Update dp[i] for all i > j and i >= (j ** 2):
            - dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    - Finally, return dp[n]
