The state expression is dp[i] where i ranges from 0 to n, representing the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i.

dp[0] = 0 (base case: no perfect squares needed for sum 0)
For each i in range(1, n+1):
    if i is a perfect square:
        dp[i] = 1
    else:
        dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1 for j in range(int(i**0.5) + 1))
Using a bottom-up approach with a tabulated array to store the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to each value from 0 to n.
