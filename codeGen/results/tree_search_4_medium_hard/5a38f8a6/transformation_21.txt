===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure because the solution to the larger problem (n) is constructed from the solutions of smaller problems (i.e., the perfect squares that sum up to n).
Consider a base case: dp[0] = 0, because there are no perfect squares that sum up to 0.
dp[i] is the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i, and dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1) for j in range(i) where j^2 <= i
Implement a top-down dynamic programming approach using memoization, where the function memoizes the results of subproblems and avoids redundant calculations.
For each problem size n, iterate from n down to the square root of n, and for each perfect square j^2 less than or equal to n, update dp[n] with min(dp[n], dp[n-j^2] + 1)
