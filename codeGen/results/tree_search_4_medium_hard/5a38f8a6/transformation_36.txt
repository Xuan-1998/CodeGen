===BEGIN PLAN===
It's more efficient to use a bottom-up approach with tabulation since we need to iterate through all possible combinations of perfect squares to find the minimum number.
The state expression is dp[i], where dp[i] represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i.
The transition relationship would be:
    1. Initialize dp[0] = 0
    2. For each integer i from 1 to n (inclusive):
        a. Calculate j, which is the largest integer such that j^2 <= i
        b. Update dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-j^2] + 1)
    3. Return dp[n]
Memoizing the function using a dictionary to store the intermediate results and avoid redundant computations
