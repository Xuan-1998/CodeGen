===BEGIN PLAN===
It's more efficient to use a bottom-up approach with tabulation since we need to iterate through all possible combinations of perfect squares to find the minimum number.
The state expression is dp[i], where dp[i] represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i.

dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1 for j in range(0, int(i**0.5) + 1) if (j ** 2) <= i),

Use a dictionary to store the computed values of dp[i] and look up the value for dp[i] whenever it's needed.

Store the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to n in a variable named result.
dp = {0: 0}

for i in range(1, n+1):
    dp[i] = float('inf')
    for j in range(int(i**0.5) + 1):
        if (j ** 2) <= i:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

result = dp[n]
