===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure because the solution to the larger problem (n) is constructed from the solutions of smaller problems (i.e., the perfect squares that sum up to n).
Consider a base case: dp[0] = 0, because there are no perfect squares that sum up to 0.
dp[i] is the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i, and dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1) for j in range(i+1), where j is a perfect square less than or equal to i.
Combine both ideas by first computing the tabulation table for smaller values (up to sqrt(n)) using the formula above, then use memoization to solve larger problems.
To avoid unnecessary computation, only calculate dp[j] when j is a perfect square. This can be done by iterating from 1 to sqrt(n) and checking if i is divisible by k^2 for each k in that range.
