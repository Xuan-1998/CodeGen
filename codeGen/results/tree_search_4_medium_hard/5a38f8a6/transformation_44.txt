It's more efficient to use a bottom-up approach with tabulation since we need to iterate through all possible combinations of perfect squares to find the minimum number.

The state expression is dp[i], where dp[i] represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i.
The transition relation is dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1) for j ranging from square root(i) down to 0, and j^2 <= i. This means we're considering all possible combinations of perfect squares less than or equal to i, and choosing the one with the minimum number of perfect squares.

Memoize function using a dictionary to store intermediate results.
For edge cases, initialize dp[0] = 0 since the only way to express 0 as the sum of perfect squares is to have no perfect squares (i.e., 0 perfect squares).
