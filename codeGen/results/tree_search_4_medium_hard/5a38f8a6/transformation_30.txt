The state expression is dp[i], where dp[i] represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i.
dp[0] = 0 (base case)
For each i from 1 to n:
    dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1 for j in range(int(i**0.5) + 1) if (j - k ** 2) >= 0 and dp[(j - k ** 2)] > 0 for k in range(int(j**0.5) + 1))
Use a dictionary to store the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to each number from 1 to n, and initialize its values as infinity.
