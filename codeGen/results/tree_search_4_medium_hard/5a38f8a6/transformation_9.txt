===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we're trying to find the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to n, we can identify overlapping subproblems by considering the maximum possible value of each perfect square (e.g., âˆšn). This means we'll need a memoized function to keep track of previously computed values.

The state expression is dp[n] where n is the input integer, representing the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to n.

dp(n) = min(dp[i] + 1 for i in range(1, int(sqrt(n)) + 1)) if n % i == 0 else dp(n)
Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach, initializing a table of size (n+1) filled with initial value INF, then fill up the table in a bottom-up manner.

Let's start by initializing the table: 
dp(0) = 0
for i from 1 to n:
    dp(i) = min(dp[i-j*j] + 1 for j from 1 to int(sqrt(i)))

The updated plan correctly identifies overlapping subproblems and uses dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach.

Note that we handle edge cases by setting the base case as dp(0) = 0, which represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to 0 (which is 0 itself). 

The only potential issue is that the plan does not explicitly check for invalid inputs. However, this can be handled separately before calling the dynamic programming function.
