===BEGIN PLAN===
It's more efficient to use a bottom-up approach with tabulation since we need to iterate through all possible combinations of perfect squares to find the minimum number.

The state expression is dp[i], where dp[i] represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i.
Let's define an array, dp, of size n+1 and initialize it as dp[0] = 0 (since we can represent 0 with 0 perfect squares).
For each i from 1 to n:
    - Calculate the maximum perfect square less than or equal to i using math.sqrt(i). If this is not an integer, round down to the nearest integer.
    - Iterate through all possible values of j that are less than or equal to the calculated value and k that are in range([0, j**0.5]) (to ensure we're only considering perfect squares).
    - For each valid combination (j - k ** 2) >= 0, if dp[(j - k ** 2)] is not negative, update dp[i] as the minimum between its current value and dp[(j - k ** 2)] + 1.
