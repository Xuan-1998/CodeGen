===BEGIN PLAN===
It's more efficient to use a bottom-up approach with tabulation since we need to iterate through all possible combinations of perfect squares to find the minimum number.
The state expression is (i, j), where (i, j) represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i with the last square being j^2.
The transition relationship would be: dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1, j in range(1, int(i**0.5) + 1))
dp[0] is set as 0 since there's no need for any perfect squares to sum up to 0
Applying dynamic programming by initializing dp with all values equal to infinity, then iteratively updating the values based on the transition relationship
For each i from 1 to n: 
    For j from 1 to int(i**0.5) + 1:
        if i >= j^2:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - j^2] + 1)
