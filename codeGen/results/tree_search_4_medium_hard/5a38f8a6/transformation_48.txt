===BEGIN PLAN===
It's more efficient to use a bottom-up approach with tabulation since we need to iterate through all possible combinations of perfect squares to find the minimum number.
The state expression is s, where s represents the set of possible summands for n.
Define a state as f(i, k) representing the least number of perfect squares that add up to i using no more than k summands.
Use a 2D list dp where dp[i][k] represents the least number of perfect squares that add up to i using no more than k summands.
Initially, set dp[0][k] = 0 for all k because the minimum number of perfect squares that add up to 0 is always 0.
For each i from 1 to n:
    For each k from 1 to min(i, sqrt(i)):
        If i is a perfect square, update dp[i][k] = 1
        Otherwise:
            Update dp[i][k] by considering the following options:
                - Add the current perfect square to the sum of some previous i and j: 
                  dp[i][k] = min(dp[i-k*k][j] + 1 for j in range(1, k+1))
                - Do not add the current perfect square to the sum: dp[i][k] = dp[i-1][k]
    Return dp[n][-1] as the result
