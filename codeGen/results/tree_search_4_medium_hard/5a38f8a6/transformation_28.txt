===BEGIN PLAN===
It's more efficient to use a bottom-up approach with tabulation since we need to iterate through all possible combinations of perfect squares to find the minimum number.
The state expression is dp[i], where dp[i] represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i.
dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1 for j in range(1, int(i**0.5) + 1) if (j ** 2) <= i and dp[i - j ** 2] > 0),
Use a dynamic programming table dp where dp[i] represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i.
For each value of n, calculate the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to n.
The base case is dp[0] = 0, representing the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to 0 (which is 0).
Start filling in the dynamic programming table from the smallest possible perfect square, which is 1.
Fill in the table by iterating through all values of i, and for each value of i, calculate dp[i] based on the state expression.
The final answer is dp[n].
