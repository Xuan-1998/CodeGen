It's more efficient to use a bottom-up approach with tabulation since we need to iterate through all possible combinations of perfect squares to find the minimum number.

The state expression is (i, k), where (i, k) represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i with the last square being k^2. This is because k could be any perfect square less than or equal to sqrt(i).

The choice of k in the transition relationship would represent the last perfect square used in the sum.

The base case would be when i is a perfect square, then the minimum number of squares is 1.

Utilize memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary as you solve them, ensuring that each subproblem is solved only once.

For edge cases, we should handle the case where n is a perfect square. In this case, the answer is simply 1.

Here's how the dynamic programming algorithm would work:

* Initialize a dictionary dp to store the results of subproblems.
* Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).
	+ For each number i, iterate through all perfect squares j^2 less than or equal to i.
		- If i is equal to j^2, then the minimum number of squares is 1.
		- Otherwise, calculate the minimum number of squares by considering two options: either include j^2 in the sum and recursively find the minimum number of squares for the remaining amount i - j^2, or don't include j^2 and recursively find the minimum number of squares for the entire amount i.
			- If including j^2 results in a smaller number of squares, then update the result.
* Return dp[n].
