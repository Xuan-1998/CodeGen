===BEGIN PLAN===
It's more efficient to use a bottom-up approach with tabulation since we need to iterate through all possible combinations of perfect squares to find the minimum number.

Define a state as f(i, k) representing the least number of perfect squares that add up to i using no more than k summands.
The base case is when k = 0, where f(i, k) is simply n since we need at least one perfect square to reach i.

Then, for each possible summand j (which is a perfect square), update the value of f(i, k) as follows:
f(i, k) = min(f(i - j, k - 1) + 1, f(i, k)) if i >= j
This means that we try to use the current summand j or not. If we can't use it (i.e., i < j), then just keep the previous result.

Finally, return f(n, n) as the result.
The state space is polynomial in size since we only consider perfect squares up to âˆšn.
To optimize, memoize the results of subproblems and update the values in memo as you solve each subproblem. This ensures that you don't recompute the same solution multiple times.
