===BEGIN PLAN===
We can solve this problem using Dynamic Programming with memoization.

The state expression is dp[i] where i ranges from 0 to n, representing the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i. We'll initialize an array dp of size n+1 with all values set to infinity (∞) except dp[0], which we set to 0 because we can represent 0 as a sum of 0 perfect squares.

We implement a recursive function with memoization using a dictionary where the key is the current value and the value is the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to that value. The base case is when i < 1, in which case dp[i] is set to ∞ because we cannot represent negative numbers or zero as a sum of perfect squares.

For each i from 1 to √n:

- If i is a perfect square (i.e., i = j^2 for some integer j), update dp[i] with the minimum value between its current value and dp[j^2-1] + 1, representing that we can represent i as a sum of one perfect square.

- Otherwise, update dp[i] with the minimum value between its current value and ∞.
- For each perfect square p (p = j^2 for some integer j) less than or equal to i:

    - If i-p is also a perfect square, update dp[i] with the minimum value between its current value and dp[p-i] + 1, representing that we can represent i as a sum of two perfect squares.

- Finally, return dp[n].

This approach ensures that we avoid redundant computations by storing previously computed values in the memoization dictionary.
