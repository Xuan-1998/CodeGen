===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure because the solution to the larger problem (n) is constructed from the solutions of smaller problems (i.e., the perfect squares that sum up to n).

Consider a base case: dp[0] = 0, because there are no perfect squares that sum up to 0.

dp[i] is the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i, and dp[i] = min(1 + dp[j]) for j in range(int(i**0.5)) + 1

Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by initializing an array dp of size n+1 with all values set to infinity, then iteratively update each value based on the recurrence relation:

dp[0] = 0
for i from 1 to n:
    for j from 0 to int(i**0.5):
        if i >= j*j:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], 1 + dp[i-j*j])
