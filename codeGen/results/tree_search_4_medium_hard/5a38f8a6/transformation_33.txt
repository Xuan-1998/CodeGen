===BEGIN PLAN===
It's more efficient to use a bottom-up approach with tabulation since we need to iterate through all possible combinations of perfect squares to find the minimum number.
The state expression is (i, j), where (i, j) represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i with the last square being j^2.
Let dp[i] be the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i.
dp = [0] * (n + 1); dp[0] = 0;
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in range(int(i**0.5) + 1):
        if i >= j**2:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], 1 + dp[i - j**2])
