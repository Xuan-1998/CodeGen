===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure because the solution to the larger problem (n) is constructed from the solutions of smaller problems (i.e., the perfect squares that sum up to n).

Consider a base case: dp[0] = 1, not 0, because there's one way to represent 0 as the sum of perfect squares - namely, 0 itself.

dp[i] represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i. To compute this, we iterate from j=1 to sqrt(i) and consider the cases where i is a perfect square or not:

- If i is a perfect square, dp[i] = 1
- Otherwise, dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1) for j in range(sqrt(i)) such that j*j <= i. This is because we can represent i as the sum of one perfect square (j*j) and some smaller number k, where k < i.

Use memoization with top-down approach to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computation.
