===BEGIN PLAN===
It's more efficient to use a bottom-up approach with tabulation since we need to iterate through all possible combinations of perfect squares to find the minimum number.
The state expression is (i, j), where (i, j) represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i with the last square being j^2. However, this approach doesn't seem necessary as we can use a 1D array and avoid unnecessary computation.

Instead, use a 1D array dp to store the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to each value from 0 to n.
The transition relationship is: dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-j^2] + 1) for j from 0 to sqrt(i), where j^2 <= i.

Initialize dp with all values as infinity except dp[0] = 0, since it takes 0 perfect squares to sum up to 0.
Fill up the dp array in a bottom-up manner, and finally return dp[n].
