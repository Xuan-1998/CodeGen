It's more efficient to use a bottom-up approach with tabulation since we need to iterate through all possible combinations of perfect squares to find the minimum number.
The state expression is (i, j), where (i, j) represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i with the last square being j^2.
The transition relationship would be: dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1, [j in range(1, int(i**0.5) + 1)] for j in range(1, int(i**0.5) + 1))
Using a table to store the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to each number from 1 to n
The final answer would be dp[n]
