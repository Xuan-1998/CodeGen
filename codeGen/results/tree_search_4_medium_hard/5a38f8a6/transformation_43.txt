It's more efficient to use a bottom-up approach with tabulation since we need to iterate through all possible combinations of perfect squares to find the minimum number.

The state expression is dp[i], where dp[i] represents the least number of perfect squares that sum up to i. The transition relation is:

dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1) for j from sqrt(i) down to 0 such that j^2 <= i

DP array initialized with infinity values and the base case dp[0] = 0 (since 0 can be represented as the sum of 0 perfect squares)

The final answer is dp[n]
