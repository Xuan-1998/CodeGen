===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure because the solution to the larger problem (n) is constructed from the solutions of smaller problems (i.e., the perfect squares that sum up to n).
The state could be defined as dp[i], where i is an integer from 1 to n, representing the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i.
dp[i] represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i, and the transition relationship is:
    dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1) for all j in {j^2 | j^2 <= i}
    (or equivalently: for all j such that j^2 * 1.5 <= i)
Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by creating an array to store the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to each value from 1 to n.
The base case would be dp[0] = 0, since it takes zero perfect squares to sum up to 0.
The final answer would be dp[n].
