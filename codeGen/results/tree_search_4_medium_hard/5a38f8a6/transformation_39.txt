It's more efficient to use a bottom-up approach with tabulation since we need to iterate through all possible combinations of perfect squares to find the minimum number.
The state expression is (i, j), where (i, j) represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i with the last square being j^2.
The choice of j in the transition relationship would represent the last perfect square used in the sum.
Design a dynamic programming table with rows representing the possible values of i from 0 to n and columns representing the possible values of j, where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i with the last square being j^2.

Let's fill the first row of the table, dp[0][j], for all possible values of j. Since there are no perfect squares that sum up to 0, we initialize this row with a value greater than the minimum number of perfect squares (which is 1), say, infinity.
For each subsequent row i, fill the column corresponding to the square root of i (since it's the largest possible value for j) and then iterate from j = sqrt(i) down to j = 1. For each j, calculate the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i - j^2 with the last square being (j-1)^2. This is the transition relationship.
The final answer would be dp[n][j] for some j, which represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to n with the last square being j^2.
