===BEGIN PLAN===
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with tabulation. Here's the updated plan:

dp = [0] * (n + 1)  # dp[i] stores the least number of perfect squares that add up to i
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    dp[i] = float('inf')  # Initialize dp[i] as infinity
    for j in range(1, int(i ** 0.5) + 1):  # Iterate through all possible combinations of perfect squares
        if i >= j * j:  # Check if i is greater than or equal to the square of j
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - j * j] + 1)  # Update dp[i] as the minimum of its current value and dp[i - j * j] + 1
    if i == n:  # Edge case: If we've reached the target sum, return the number of perfect squares needed
        break

return dp[n]
