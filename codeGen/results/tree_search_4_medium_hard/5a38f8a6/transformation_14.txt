===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure because the solution to the larger problem (n) is constructed from the solutions of smaller problems (i.e., the perfect squares that sum up to n).
The state could be defined as dp[i], where i is an integer from 1 to n, representing the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i.
dp[i] represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i, and the transition relationship is dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1) for all j in {j^2 | j^2 <= i}.
This plan assumes that the problem can be solved by breaking it down into smaller subproblems, which is correct. The use of memoization is also a good idea to avoid redundant computation.
However, there's an edge case that needs to be considered: when n is 0 or 1, the answer should be 0. This isn't explicitly handled in the plan, but it can be easily added as a base case.
