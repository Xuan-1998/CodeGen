===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem has optimal substructure because the solution to the larger problem (n) is constructed from the solutions of smaller problems (i.e., the perfect squares that sum up to n).
Consider a base case: dp[0] = 1, not 0, since we need at least one perfect square to sum up to 0 (which is 0 itself).
dp[i] is the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i.
dp[i] = min(1 + dp[j]) for j in range(sqrt(i)) 
    * If i can be represented as a single perfect square, then we need one more perfect square to sum up to i.
    * Otherwise, consider all possible values of j such that j^2 <= i and find the minimum number of perfect squares needed to sum up to i - j^2.
Utilize a memoized function that takes an integer input and returns the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to that number, with base cases handling 0 and negative integers separately.
To avoid overflows when calculating j^2, consider using long long instead of int for the calculation.
