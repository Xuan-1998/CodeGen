===BEGIN PLAN===
It's more efficient to use a bottom-up approach with tabulation since we need to iterate through all possible combinations of perfect squares to find the minimum number.
The state expression is dp[i], where dp[i] represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum up to i.
dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1 for j in range(int(i**0.5) + 1) if dp[(j - k ** 2)] > 0 for k in range(int(j**0.5) + 1) if (j - k ** 2) >= 0),
The base case is initializing the dp array with all values set to infinity.
dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
dp[0] = 0
Use a loop to fill up the dp array.
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    for j in range(int(i**0.5) + 1):
        k = int(j**0.5)
        if (j - k ** 2) >= 0 and dp[(j - k ** 2)] > 0:
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
Finally, return dp[n] as the result.
return dp[n]
