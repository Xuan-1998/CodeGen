===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each city's shortest distance from capital can be found independently by performing DFS/BFS from the city, which leads to a bottom-up approach with tabulation.
The state expression could be the number of reversed edges needed to reach each city from the capital, i.e., dp[i] = # reversed edges to reach city i.
dp[i] represents the minimum number of edge reversals needed to reach city i from the capital. The transitions are based on DFS/BFS, where dp[i] is updated by considering all its neighbors.

Initialize a list of size n, where dp[i] will store the minimum number of reversed edges to reach city i from the capital.
Maintain an additional list or variable to keep track of the order in which cities were visited during the DFS/BFS process. This would help determine the optimal capital city and the minimum number of roads that need to be inverted.

To improve the plan, consider using a more efficient data structure such as a disjoint-set data structure (Union-Find) for the DFS/BFS step to reduce the time complexity.
The current plan does not handle edge cases where there are no roads or all cities are connected. Add checks at the beginning of the program to ensure these edge cases are handled correctly.
