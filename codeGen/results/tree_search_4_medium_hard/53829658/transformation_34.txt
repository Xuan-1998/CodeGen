===BEGIN PLAN===
Recognize that for a given city, its shortest distance from capital is the minimum of itself and one-edge shorter distances from all adjacent cities.

The state could be defined as dp[i], representing the minimum number of roads that need to be inverted in order to reach city i from the capital. The base case would be dp[0] = 0, since there are no roads that need to be inverted when starting at the capital.

Alternatively, the state could be defined as a list of distances from the capital, and the transition relationship could be formulated as updating the distance of each child city based on the distance of its parent city.

Implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach using a 2D table to store the minimum number of roads that need to be inverted for each city, given its parent city. Initialize dp[i] to infinity for all i, then iterate over edges and update dp[i] based on the parent-child relationship.
