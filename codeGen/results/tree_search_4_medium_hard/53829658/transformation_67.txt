===BEGIN PLAN===
Observe that the optimal capital city would be the one with the maximum in-degree, which can be found by simply iterating through each city and keeping track of its in-degree.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = minimum number of reversed roads needed to reach city j from city i, with base case being dp[1][i] = 0 for all i. This choice focuses on finding the minimum number of reversed roads for each pair of cities.

dp[i][j] is updated as min(dp[i][k] + 1) where k is such that there's an edge from city k to city j and i != k. 

The plan can be improved by initializing dp[][] with a default value, say infinity or a very large number, for all pairs (i, j). This way we ensure that the minimum number of reversed roads needed to reach any city is initially set to infinity.

The nested loop structure where you iterate over each city and for each city, iterate over its incoming edges can be implemented as follows:

for i from 2 to n:
    for k in range(1, n+1):
        if there's an edge from city k to city i:
            dp[i][k] = min(dp[i][k], dp[k][i] + 1)

Finally, the capital city is the one with the maximum in-degree.
