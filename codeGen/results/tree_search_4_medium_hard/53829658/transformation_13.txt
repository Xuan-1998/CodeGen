===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each city's shortest distance from capital can be found independently by performing DFS/BFS from the city, which leads to a bottom-up approach with tabulation.
Define the state expression as a boolean array representing whether each city is reachable from the capital with 0 or more reversed edges.
The state and transition relationships could be formulated as: for each city j, let reachable_j[k] be a boolean indicating whether j is reachable from the capital by reversing at most k edges. Then, reachable_j[k] is true if and only if there exists an edge (i,j) such that i is reachable from the capital by reversing at most k-1 edges.
Utilize a dictionary to store the state and transition relationships as key-value pairs, where the keys represent the cities and the values are lists of cities that can be reached from each other.
For the minimum number of reversed edges, iterate through all possible choices for the capital city and find the minimum number of reversed edges required to reach any other city from the chosen capital.
To solve this problem, we will use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach. Create a 2D boolean array dp where dp[i][k] is true if city i can be reached from the capital by reversing at most k edges.
Fill in the dp table row by row. For each city j, iterate over all cities i such that there's an edge (i,j). If city i can be reached with k-1 reversed edges, then city j can also be reached with k reversed edges.
Finally, for the minimum number of reversed edges, iterate through the last column of the dp table and find the smallest index where the value is true. This corresponds to the minimum number of reversed edges required to reach any other city from the chosen capital.
