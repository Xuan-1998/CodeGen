===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each city's shortest distance from capital can be found independently by performing DFS/BFS from the city, which leads to a bottom-up approach with tabulation.
Define the state expression as a boolean array representing whether each city is reachable from the capital with 0 or more reversed edges.
Implement memoization using a dictionary to store and retrieve intermediate results for efficient computation.

Update the plan:

* Initialize a graph representation of the directed tree
* Perform DFS/BFS from each city to find the shortest distance from that city to the capital, considering the minimum number of reversed edges
* Use dynamic programming to fill in a 2D array dp of size n x n, where dp[i][j] represents whether city j can be reached from city i by reversing at most k edges
* Iterate through each edge (si, ti) and update dp[si-1][ti-1] based on the current minimum number of reversed edges required to reach city ti from city si
* Finally, find the optimal capital city that allows the minimum number of reversed edges to be reached from any other city
