===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the state as dp[i], which is the minimum number of edges to be reversed in order to reach city i from the capital. Initialize dp with n-1 elements set to infinity, where n is the number of cities.

For each road (si, ti), update dp[ti] by taking the minimum between its current value and 1 plus the value of dp[si].

Define a boolean array visited[] of size n initialized as all False. Initialize result as an empty list.

Perform a DFS from city 0 to all other cities. For each city i, mark it as visited and push it into the result if not already present in the result.

Return the minimum value among dp[1...n-1] and the result.
===END PLAN===
