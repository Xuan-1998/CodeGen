===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each city's shortest distance from capital can be found independently by performing DFS/BFS from the city, which leads to a bottom-up approach with tabulation.

Define the state expression as a boolean array representing whether each city is reachable from the capital with 0 or more reversed edges.

The state and transition relationships could be formulated as: for each city j, let reachable_j[k] be a boolean indicating whether j is reachable from the capital by reversing at most k edges. Then, reachable_j[k] is true if and only if there exists an edge (i,j) such that i is reachable from the capital by reversing at most k-1 edges.

Use a 2D boolean array to store the state of each city being reachable with 0 to k reversed edges, where k is the maximum number of edges that can be reversed. 

Update the plan as follows:
* Initialize a boolean array dp[n][n] such that dp[i][j] is true if and only if vertex j is reachable from vertex i by reversing at most n-1 edges.
* Iterate over all edges (i, j) in topological order (or any other order), update dp[i][j] as follows: 
  * For each edge (i, j), if there exists a path from the capital to vertex i that only uses reversed edges and takes at most k-1 reversals, then update dp[j][k-1] to be true.
* The minimum number of reversed edges required for any city can be calculated by finding the maximum k such that reachable[n-1][k] is true.
