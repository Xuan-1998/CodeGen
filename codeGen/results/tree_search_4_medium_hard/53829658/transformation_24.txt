===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each city's shortest distance from capital can be found independently by performing DFS/BFS from the city, which leads to a bottom-up approach with tabulation.

The state expression could be the number of reversed edges needed to reach each city from the capital, i.e., dp[i] = # reversed edges to reach city i.

'State' could be the distance from capital to each city (or in this case, the number of reversed edges needed), where state[i] is updated by considering all its neighbors with a BFS/DFS approach.

Using dynamic programming to store and reuse previously computed values for each city.

Initially, dp[1] = 0 (capital itself has no reversed edges).
For each city i > 1:
    For each neighbor j of i (i.e., roads from i to j):
        Update dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[i] + 1) if i is the parent node in the DFS/BFS.
    Return dp[2..n].

This plan can be improved by avoiding unnecessary computation for a city's neighbors. To do this, mark each city as visited after computing its state. This way, we don't need to visit the same city twice.

Potential issues with the plan:
- The problem doesn't explicitly specify that the capital is vertex 1. We should consider all vertices as potential capitals and find the minimum number of reversed edges for each.
- The current approach assumes that all cities are reachable from the capital. If this is not guaranteed, we need to handle unreachable cities.

Edge cases:
- If n = 2, there's only one possible choice for the capital, and no roads need to be reversed.
- If n = 3, the capital can be either vertex 1 or vertex 2, and one road needs to be reversed in each case.
