===BEGIN PLAN===
Observe that the optimal capital city would be the one with the maximum in-degree, which can be found by simply iterating through each city and keeping track of its in-degree.

The state expression is dp[i] = min number of reversed roads to reach city i from an arbitrary capital, with base case being dp[0] = 0. This choice considers the maximum out-degree as the optimal capital.
dp[i] = min number of reversed roads to reach city i from an arbitrary capital with no edges reversed, and if edge (i-1) is not reachable directly, then try reversing edge from city (i-1) to city i

Implement memoization using a recursive function with a cache dictionary to store previously computed values and avoid redundant computations.
