===BEGIN PLAN===
Observe that the optimal capital city would be the one with the maximum in-degree, which can be found by simply iterating through each city and keeping track of its in-degree.

The state expression is dp[i] = max number of reversed roads to reach city i from an arbitrary capital, with base case being dp[1] = 0. This choice considers the maximum in-degree as the optimal capital.

dp[i] = min(max number of cities that can be reached from city i with no edges reversed, dp[j-1] + 1) if there is an edge from city j to city i and not all such edges have been used

The plan will then iterate over each city, considering the maximum in-degree as the optimal capital. Then, it will calculate the minimum number of roads that need to be reversed for every other city starting from this capital.

This can be achieved by maintaining a priority queue where cities are ordered based on their out-degrees (i.e., the number of edges leaving each city). For each city, we add its in-degree to the total count and update the minimum number of roads that need to be reversed. We continue doing this until the maximum in-degree is reached.

This plan does not include edge cases but can be improved by considering all possible scenarios. It's a good starting point for solving this problem.
