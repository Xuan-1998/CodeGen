===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each city's shortest distance from capital can be found independently by performing DFS/BFS from the city, which leads to a bottom-up approach with tabulation.
Define the state expression as a boolean array representing whether each city is reachable from the capital with 0 or more reversed edges.
A bottom-up approach with tabulation could involve initializing a 2D array dp of size n x n, where dp[i][j] represents whether city j can be reached from city i by reversing at most k edges.

Initialize an array dist to store the shortest distance from each city to the capital. Perform DFS/BFS from each city to fill in this array.
For each city i, iterate over its neighbors and update dp[i][j] accordingly.
Tabulate the reachable cities from each city by performing BFS/DFS again.

Once the dp table is filled, initialize a set of possible capitals with all cities.
Iterate over the dp table and mark as unreachable any city that cannot be reached from its neighbors. Update the set of possible capitals accordingly.

The remaining cities in the set are the optimal capital choices.
