===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each city's shortest distance from capital can be found independently by performing DFS/BFS from the city, which leads to a bottom-up approach with tabulation.

The state expression could be the number of reversed edges needed to reach each city from the capital, i.e., dp[i] = # reversed edges to reach city i.
'State' could be the distance from capital to each city (or in this case, the number of reversed edges needed), where state[i] is updated by considering all its neighbors with a BFS/DFS approach.

Implementing memoization using Python's built-in dictionary data structure to store the states of cities as they are processed. 
Update state values for unvisited nodes until no new updates occur.

To minimize the number of reversed edges, we need to find the maximum depth from the capital.
A possible mistake in this plan could be that it doesn't account for whether a city is reachable or not; we should keep track of visited nodes.
This approach ensures the state values are computed only once, which leads to O(n) time complexity where n is the number of cities.

The corrected version would be:
