===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each city's shortest distance from capital can be found independently by performing DFS/BFS from the city, which leads to a bottom-up approach with tabulation.

The state expression could be the number of reversed edges needed to reach each city from the capital, i.e., dp[i] = # reversed edges to reach city i.

Let state s[i] be the minimum number of reversed edges to reach city i. Transitions:
for each neighbor j, if there's no edge between i and j or it's directed towards j, then update s[i] = min(s[i], 1 + s[j])

Use memoization with recursive function calls to calculate the shortest distance from the capital to each city and return the minimum number of reversed edges needed.

The plan seems correct. To improve it:
- Use topological sorting to process nodes in a order that ensures no backtracking is required.
- Instead of using DFS/BFS, use dynamic programming where dp[i] represents the minimum number of reversed edges to reach city i from the capital.

Potential issues with the plan include:
- Edge cases: Make sure the capital city is chosen optimally. If not, it might lead to incorrect results.
