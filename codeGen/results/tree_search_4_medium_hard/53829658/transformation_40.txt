===BEGIN PLAN===
Define states as dp[i][p], where i is the city and p is the number of roads that have been inverted so far in order to reach city i from the capital.

Base case: dp[1][0] = 1, since one road needs to be inverted in order to reach city 2 from city 1.

State transition equation:
dp[i][p] = min(dp[j][p-1] + (i != j) for j in neighbors(i))

where neighbors(i) is the set of cities that are directly connected to city i.

The goal is to minimize dp[n][p], where n is the total number of cities and p is the minimum number of roads that need to be inverted in order to reach any other city from the capital.

Initialize dp with base case values for all cities.
Fill in dp table using state transition equation.

Answer: The minimum number of roads to be inverted is dp[n][p], where n is the total number of cities and p is the minimum number of roads that need to be inverted in order to reach any other city from the capital.
Print dp[n][p].
Print all possible ways to choose the capital â€” a sequence of indexes of cities in the increasing order.

This plan handles edge cases by correctly calculating the minimum number of roads to be inverted for each city and handling the base case. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the total number of cities.
