===BEGIN PLAN===
The optimal capital city is the root node with the minimum height in the tree. This can be calculated by performing a depth-first search (DFS) and updating the parent nodes as we traverse the tree. 
The state could be defined as a dictionary, where dp[i] represents the minimum number of roads that need to be inverted in order to reach city i from the capital. The base case would be dp[0] = 0, since there are no roads that need to be inverted when starting at the capital.
To avoid redundant computations and improve efficiency, we can use memoization by defining a dictionary to store the precomputed values of dp[i].
During the DFS traversal, for each city i, we calculate its minimum distance from the capital as the minimum of itself and one-edge shorter distances from all adjacent cities. This would give us the minimum number of roads that need to be inverted in order to reach any other city from the chosen capital.
Finally, we return the minimum height node found during the DFS traversal, which represents the optimal capital city.

Note: The plan does not include edge cases explicitly, but it can handle edge cases by ensuring that the DFS traversal is performed correctly and all cities are visited before returning the result. This would involve proper handling of the start and end nodes in the tree.
