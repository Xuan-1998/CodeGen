===BEGIN PLAN===
To improve the plan:
1. Define the state expression as dp[i][j] = minimum number of reversed roads needed to reach city j from city i and update it accordingly throughout the solution
2. Consider implementing a bottom-up approach by iterating through each city and updating the in-degree of that city and all its predecessors
3. Start from city 1 and update dp[i][j] for each subsequent city i, considering only cities with an in-degree greater than or equal to 0
4. For each city i, update dp[i][j] as the minimum number of reversed roads needed to reach city j from city i by iterating through all predecessors k of city i and calculating dp[k][i] + 1 if city i is reachable from city k in one step and city i has not been visited before
5. Keep track of the maximum in-degree city during the process, which would be the optimal capital city
6. Finally, print the minimum number of reversed roads needed to reach any other city from the capital and all possible ways to choose the capital
