===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each city's shortest distance from capital can be found independently by performing DFS/BFS from the city, which leads to a bottom-up approach with tabulation.

The state expression could be the shortest distance of each city from the capital, i.e., dp[i] = min distance from city i to the capital.

Let dp[i] be the minimum number of edges that need to be reversed such that city i can be reached from the capital. Then dp[i] = min(dp[j] + 1) for all j that have an edge pointing to i.

Create a dynamic programming table where each cell represents the minimum number of edges to be reversed to reach city i from the capital.

Calculate the initial values: dp[1] = 0 (since the capital is reachable in 0 edges), and dp[i] = âˆž for all other cities. Then fill up the table based on the given roads, considering that each edge pointing to a city can potentially reduce its distance by 1.

Finally, return the maximum value in the table as the minimum number of edges to be reversed in order to reach any other city from the capital, and list all indices of cities with this maximum value as possible choices for the capital.
