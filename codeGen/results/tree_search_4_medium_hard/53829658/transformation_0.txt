===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each city's shortest distance from capital can be found independently by performing DFS/BFS from the city, which leads to a bottom-up approach with tabulation.
The state expression could be the shortest distance of each city from the capital, i.e., dp[i] = min distance from city i to the capital.
dp[i] is the minimum number of edges that need to be reversed such that city i can be reached from the capital, which is updated by considering all possible previous cities j.

Perform DFS/BFS from the capital and update the state expression dp[i]:
  - Initialize dp[1] = 0 (since we start from the capital)
  - For each city i > 1:
    + Update dp[i] as the minimum of:
      * The current value of dp[i]
      * The value of dp[j] + 1, where j is the parent node of i
  - Calculate the minimum number of edges to be reversed: 
    + Initialize res = âˆž
    + For each city i > 1:
      * Update res as the minimum of:
        * The current value of res
        * dp[i] + (the number of cities reachable from i that need to be reversed)
