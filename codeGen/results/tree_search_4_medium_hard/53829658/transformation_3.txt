===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each city's shortest distance from capital can be found independently by performing DFS/BFS from the city, which leads to a bottom-up approach with tabulation.

The state expression could be the shortest distance of each city from the capital, i.e., dp[i] = min distance from city i to the capital.
dp[i] represents the shortest distance (in terms of number of reversals) from city i to the capital, and dp[j] + 1 is the transition relation if there's an edge from j to i.

Use dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach. Initialize an array dp of size n, where dp[i] will store the minimum number of edges that need to be reversed to reach city i from the capital.
Iterate over all roads and for each road (si, ti), update dp[ti] = min(dp[ti], dp[si] + 1).
In the end, the minimum value in dp array is the minimum number of roads that needs to be inverted. All possible ways to choose the capital are represented by a sequence of indexes of cities in increasing order.

This plan correctly identifies the dynamic programming approach and correctly models the state transition.
It can be improved further by optimizing the code for better time complexity.
Edge cases will not be an issue as long as the initial values for dp array are handled correctly. No additional special handling is required.
