===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each city's shortest distance from capital can be found independently by performing DFS/BFS from the city, which leads to a bottom-up approach with tabulation.
The state expression could be the number of reversed edges needed to reach each city from the capital, i.e., dp[i] = # reversed edges to reach city i.
'State' could be the distance from capital to each city (or in this case, the number of reversed edges needed), where state[i] is updated by considering all its neighbors with a BFS/DFS approach
Initialize an array dp with n elements, all set to infinity except dp[0], which is 0. This represents the initial assumption that it takes infinite reversed edges to reach any city from the capital.
Perform DFS/BFS from each city i in order, updating state[i] as the minimum of state[i-1] + 1 (if reversing edge (i-1,i) makes sense), and considering all its neighbors. This is because for each city, we want to know the number of reversed edges needed to reach it.
After visiting all cities, the value in dp array represents the minimum number of reversed edges needed to reach any other city from the capital.
To find all possible ways to choose the capital, iterate over the array and print indices with values equal to 0 (since they represent the capital), then iterate backwards to keep printing until reaching the first non-zero index. This ensures that we are not counting the same city twice as a capital.
