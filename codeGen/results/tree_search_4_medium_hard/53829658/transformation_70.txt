===BEGIN PLAN===
Observe that the optimal capital city would be the one with the maximum in-degree, which can be found by simply iterating through each city and keeping track of its in-degree.

The state expression is dp[i][j] = minimum number of reversed roads needed to reach city j from city i, with base case being dp[1][i] = 0 for all i. This choice focuses on finding the minimum number of reversed roads for each pair of cities.
dp[i][j] is updated as min(dp[k][j] + 1) where k is such that there's an edge from city i to city k.

To find the optimal capital, we iterate through each city and calculate its in-degree. The city with the maximum in-degree is chosen as the optimal capital.
The final answer is the minimum number of reversed roads needed to reach any other city from the optimal capital, which can be calculated by iterating through each city j and updating dp[i][j] for all i.
