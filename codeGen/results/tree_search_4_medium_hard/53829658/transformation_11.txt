===BEGIN PLAN===
Define the state expression as a 2D array dp, where dp[i][j] is true if city i can be reached from the capital by reversing at most j edges.

Implement memoization using a dictionary memo to store the intermediate results of the state expressions. The key in the memo would be the pair (i, j) and the value would be the boolean result dp[i][j].

The dynamic programming approach could be to fill up the dp array from top to bottom, considering each city one by one. For each city i, calculate the shortest distance from the capital to reach this city with at most k reversed edges.

For every pair of cities (i, j), where edge (i, j) exists and j is reachable from the capital, consider reversing edge (i, j). If this reversal does not exceed k, then city j can be reached from i by reversing at most k - 1 edges. This could lead to a new path that allows city j to be reached from the capital with at most k reversed edges.

Maintain an array capital_cities of size n, where capital_cities[i] is true if city i should be chosen as the capital.
The plan can be improved by implementing edge cases and handling them properly. For instance, when n equals 1 or 2, there will not be any choice for the capital city, so you could handle these situations separately.
