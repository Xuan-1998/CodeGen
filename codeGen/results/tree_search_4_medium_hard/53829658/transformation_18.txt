===BEGIN PLAN===
Use a 1D array to store the dynamic programming state values and iterate over each city in order. Initialize all dp[i] = i - 1 (since we need to reverse all edges to reach city i from itself). Iterate over each edge: for every neighbor, update dp[i] by choosing the minimum number of reversed edges needed to reach it from the capital, considering both cases where this edge is reversed and not reversed. The final answer will be dp[0], which represents the minimum number of edge reversals needed to reach any city from the capital.
