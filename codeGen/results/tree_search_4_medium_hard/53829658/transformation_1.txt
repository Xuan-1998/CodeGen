===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each city's shortest distance from capital can be found independently by performing DFS/BFS from the city, which leads to a bottom-up approach with tabulation.

The state expression could be the shortest distance of each city from the capital, i.e., dp[i] = min distance from city i to the capital.

dp[i] is the minimum number of edges that need to be reversed such that city i can be reached from the capital, which is updated by considering all possible previous cities j.

Memoizing the minimum number of edges that need to be reversed by using a dictionary to store and reuse previously computed values.

For each city, perform DFS/BFS from it to calculate dp[i], and for each edge (i, j), consider updating dp[j] based on dp[i].
