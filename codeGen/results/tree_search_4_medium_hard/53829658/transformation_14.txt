===BEGIN PLAN===
Identify that each city's shortest distance from capital can be found independently by performing DFS/BFS from the city, which leads to a bottom-up approach with tabulation.

Define the state expression as a boolean array representing whether each city is reachable from the capital with 0 or more reversed edges.
The state and transition relationships could be formulated as: for each city j, let reachable_j[k] be a boolean indicating whether j is reachable from the capital by reversing at most k edges. Then, reachable_j[k] is true if and only if there exists an edge (i,j) such that i is reachable from the capital by reversing at most k-1 edges.

Design a recursive function that takes the city's index and the current number of reversed edges as parameters, and returns True if the city is reachable from the capital and False otherwise. The function can be optimized to use memoization or dynamic programming for better performance.

To improve the plan, consider using memoization or dynamic programming to store and reuse the results of subproblems, which can significantly speed up the computation time.

Potential issues with the plan include:

* Handling edge cases: what if there are multiple cities that have the same shortest distance from the capital? How would you handle this situation?
