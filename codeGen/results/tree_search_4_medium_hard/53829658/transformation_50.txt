===BEGIN PLAN===
The state can be defined as dp[i], which is an integer representing the minimum number of roads that need to be reversed in order to reach city i from the capital.

The base case would be dp[0] = 0, since we are starting at the capital and do not need to reverse any roads.

Define the state update rule: for all i > 0, dp[i] is the minimum of:

* The value of dp[prev] + 1 (where prev is the parent city of i) if city i can be reached by reversing one edge from the capital to city prev.
* The value of dp[j] + 1 (where j is an adjacent city of i that has not been reached yet) if city i can be reached by reversing one edge from city j to city i.

The final answer would be dp[n-1], where n is the number of cities, representing the minimum number of roads that need to be reversed in order to reach any other city from the capital.

To find all possible ways to choose the capital, we can maintain a set or array of visited cities and update it accordingly as we calculate dp[i].

The time complexity would be O(n) since we are processing each city once. The space complexity would be also O(n) for storing the dp array.
