===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to maximize the distance, consider using a top-down approach with memoization and pruning to avoid unnecessary computations.

Initialize a 3D DP table where each cell (i, j, k) represents the maximum distance after executing i commands, modifying at most j of them, and having k units moved forward. The extra dimension is used to store information about how many units were moved forward in previous steps.

DP[i][j][k] represents the maximum distance achieved after executing i commands, considering all possible ways to modify at most j commands and allowing at most k units to be moved forward.

Consider a cell in the DP table as (i, k) where i represents the number of commands executed and k is the maximum number of modifications allowed so far. The value of this cell would be the maximum distance achieved after executing i commands and allowing at most k modifications.

To avoid recomputing subproblems, use memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary. This way, when you encounter a subproblem again, you can simply retrieve its result from the dictionary instead of computing it all over again.

To prune unnecessary computations, consider the fact that if a command is "F", moving forward one unit does not affect the maximum distance. Therefore, we only need to consider the commands that are "T" and modify them to "F" or vice versa.
