===BEGIN PLAN===
Initialize a 2D DP table where each cell (i, j) represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.

Let's define dp[i][j] as the maximum possible distance from the starting point to the ending point after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.

For base cases:
- dp[0][j] = 0, since no commands are executed
- dp[i][0] = i * (distance per command), since all i commands are executed without modification

Top-down approach with memoization:
- If i > n, return dp[i-n][n], since we can't modify more than n commands
- If j == 0 or j == 1, return the base case values
- Otherwise, consider two possibilities:
    - Modify one command and execute the remaining i-1 commands with at most j-1 modifications (dp[i-1][j-1])
    - Don't modify any commands and execute the remaining i commands (dp[i][j-1])
  Return the maximum of these two values

===END PLAN===
