===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to maximize the distance, consider using a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming and memoization. Initialize a 2D DP table where each cell (i, j) represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.

DP[i][j] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands, considering all possible ways to modify at most j commands. The state is represented by the pair (i, k), which captures the information about how many commands have been executed and how many modifications are left to make.

The transition relationship can be formulated as:

DP[i][k] = max(
    DP[i-1][k-1] + 1 if the i-th command is 'F', 
    DP[i-1][k] if the i-th command is 'T' and modification allowed, 
    DP[i-1][k-1] if the i-th command is 'T' and no more modifications are left
) for k = 0 to n.

Utilize dynamic programming by defining a recursive function that calculates the maximum distance based on the given commands, then use memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. To further optimize the plan, consider using a bottom-up approach instead of top-down, as it might be more efficient in this case.
