===BEGIN PLAN===
We will use dynamic programming with memoization to solve this problem. Initialize a 2D DP table where each cell (i, j) represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.

Let dp[i][j] represent the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them. The base case is when i = 0, in which case we can't move or turn around, so dp[0][j] = 0 for all j.

For non-base cases, we consider two options: either we execute the current command (turn around or move forward) and modify at most j-1 of the remaining commands, or we don't execute the current command and modify at most j of the remaining commands. The maximum distance is the maximum of these two options.

We can use a dictionary to store the memoized values and update them as we iterate through the commands. This will reduce the computation time by avoiding redundant calculations.

The transition relationship is dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] if command i is 'T' else 1 + dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j]).

We initialize dp[0][j] = 0 for all j. Then, we iterate through the commands and update the DP table accordingly.

The final answer is dp[n][k].
