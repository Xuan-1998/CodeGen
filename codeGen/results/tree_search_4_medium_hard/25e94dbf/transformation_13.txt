===BEGIN PLAN===
DP[i][j] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j commands.

The transition relationship can be formulated as:
DP[i][k] = max(
    DP[i-1][k-1] + 1 if the i-th command is 'F',
    DP[i-1][k] if the i-th command is 'T' and modification allowed,
    DP[i-1][k-1] if the i-th command is 'T' and no more modifications are left
) for k = 0 to n.

Design a bottom-up tabulation-based solution using a 2D array dp[i][j] where each cell represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j commands. Initialize the DP table with zeros, and fill it in by iterating through the commands and considering all possible modifications.

Initialize the DP table as follows:
dp[0][j] = 0 for j = 0 to n
dp[i][0] = 0 for i = 1 to m

Fill in the DP table using the transition relationship. The base case is when i = 0 or k = 0, where dp[i][k] = 0.

The recursive formula can be implemented as follows:
for i from 1 to m
    for j from 1 to n
        if commands[i-1] == 'F'
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1, dp[i-1][j])
        elif commands[i-1] == 'T' and j > 0
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j])
        else
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]

The maximum distance is stored in the bottom-right corner of the DP table, i.e., dp[m][n].

Return dp[m][n].
