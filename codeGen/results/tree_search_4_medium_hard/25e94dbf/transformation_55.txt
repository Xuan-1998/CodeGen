===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Initialize a 2D DP array where each cell (i, j) represents the maximum distance after executing i commands, considering that exactly j of them are 'T' commands.

Define the state as dp[i][j] = maximum distance after executing i commands, considering that exactly j of them are 'T' commands.

Use a loop to fill in the table, considering all possible modifications at each step. For each command, check if it's a 'T' or 'F' and update the DP array accordingly.

Maintain a 2D DP array dp[i][j] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands, considering that exactly j of them are 'T' commands.

To improve the plan:

* Initialize the base case for the first command (dp[0][j]) as 1, since we can always move forward one unit.
* For each cell in the DP array, calculate the maximum distance by considering all possible modifications at each step. This will involve recursively calling dp[i-1][k] where k is the number of 'T' commands in the previous state that results in a valid modification.

Potential issues with the plan:

* The plan assumes that the input string contains only "T" and "F" characters, but it does not explicitly handle this constraint.
* The plan also assumes that n is between 1 and 50, as stated in the problem constraints. However, it does not explicitly check for these conditions.

Edge cases:
* If the input string is empty (i.e., all 'T' commands), the maximum distance would be 0.
* If the number of 'T' commands exceeds n, we can simply treat the remaining commands as "F" and update the DP array accordingly.
