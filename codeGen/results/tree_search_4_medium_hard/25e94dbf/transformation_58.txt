===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Initialize a 2D DP array dp[i][j] where each cell i represents the maximum distance after executing i commands, considering that exactly j of them are 'T' commands.

Define the state as dp[i][j] = maximum distance after executing i commands, considering that exactly j of them are 'T' commands. Initialize a base case for dp[0][j] where 0 <= j <= n and fill in the table using a loop to consider all possible modifications at each step.

For each command, if it is an 'F' command, update dp[i][j] by considering the maximum distance after executing i-1 commands (and the same number of 'T' commands) plus 1. If it is a 'T' command, update dp[i][j] by considering the maximum distance after executing i-1 commands with j-1 'T' commands.

Finally, return dp[n][k] where k is the total count of 'T' commands in the original string.
