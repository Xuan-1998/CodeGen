===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by identifying the subproblems as: given a set of n commands, find the maximum distance that can be reached by modifying exactly k commands. This is an optimal substructure since we only consider the maximum possible distance.

The state expression could be dp[i][j][direction] = max_distance_reachable(i, j, direction) for i in range(len(commands)), j in range(1, 51), and direction in {'T', 'F'}, where direction represents the current direction of the turtle.

dp[j] = max_distance_reachable(len(commands), j) for j in range(1, 51), where dp[j] represents the maximum distance reachable after modifying exactly j commands

Create a 3D table with dimensions (len(commands), n+1, 2) and fill it up using nested loops and conditional statements. Initialize dp[i][j][direction] as -float('inf') for all i, j, and direction. This will handle the edge case where no modification is possible.

Fill in the base cases: if the command at index i is 'F', then dp[i][0]['T'] = 1 (since moving forward always increases distance) and dp[i][0]['F'] = -1 (since moving backward decreases distance).

For each command, consider two possibilities: modify or don't modify. If we modify, we have j-1 remaining modifications left, so recursively calculate the maximum distance reachable after modifying j-1 commands.

If we don't modify, we have j remaining modifications left. So, recursively calculate the maximum distance reachable after modifying j commands in that case.

Finally, return dp[n][n]['T'] as the maximum distance reachable after modifying exactly n commands.
