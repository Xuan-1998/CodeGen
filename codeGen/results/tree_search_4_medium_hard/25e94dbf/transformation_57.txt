===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Initialize a 2D DP array where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and exactly j of them are 'T' commands.

Define the state as dp[i][0] = maximum distance after executing i 'F' commands, and define the transition relation as follows:

- If the (i-1)th command is 'F', then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + 1
- If the (i-1)th command is 'T', then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1

Fill in the table using a loop to consider all possible modifications at each step, and update the state accordingly.

Determine the maximum distance after executing all commands as the maximum value in the last row of the DP array.
===END PLAN===
