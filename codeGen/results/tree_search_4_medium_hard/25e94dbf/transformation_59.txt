===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Initialize a 2D DP array where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and considering that exactly j of them are 'T' commands.

Define the state as dp[i][j] = maximum distance after executing i commands, considering that exactly j of them are 'T' commands. This way, we can consider all possible modifications at each step.

Initialize a 2D DP array where each cell [i][0] represents the maximum distance after executing i 'F' commands (no turns), and cell [i][i-1] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands with exactly i-1 turns. This way, we can handle the edge cases for n = 1, 2, ...

Consider using dynamic programming with a 2D array where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and considering that exactly j of them are 'T' commands.
