===BEGIN PLAN===
Initialize a 2D DP table with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1), where n is the number of commands that can be modified. Each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.
The base case is when i = 0, where dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since no commands have been executed.

The transition relationship could be defined as:
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k-1] + 1, dp[i-1][j]) for k ranging from 0 to min(i, j).

This means that the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them is the maximum of:

* The maximum distance after executing i-1 commands and modifying at most k-1 of them (where k ranges from 0 to min(i, j)), plus the distance gained by moving forward once.
* The maximum distance after executing i-1 commands and modifying at most j of them.

Fill up the DP table iteratively, starting with the base case. The final answer is dp[n][n].
