===BEGIN PLAN===
DP[i][j] is the maximum possible distance from the starting point to the ending point after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.

The base case for DP[i][j] is when i = 0, in which case the maximum distance is 0.

For i > 0, consider two options: either modify the last command or not. If we do not modify the last command, then the maximum distance would be DP[i-1][j]. If we do modify the last command, then the maximum distance would be DP[i-1][min(j-1, i)]. The reason for taking the minimum of j-1 and i is that modifying a command can only decrease the distance, so at most min(j-1, i) commands can be modified.

The transition relationship could be defined as:
DP[i][j] = max(DP[i-1][min(j-1, i)] + 1, DP[i-1][j])

We also need to consider the case where j > 0 and we don't modify any command. In this case, the maximum distance would be DP[i-1][j].

The complete dynamic programming plan is:
DP[0][j] = 0 for all j
For i from 1 to n:
    For j from 0 to min(n, i):
        if j == 0: // don't modify any command
            DP[i][j] = DP[i-1][j]
        else: // modify the last command
            DP[i][j] = max(DP[i-1][min(j-1, i)] + 1, DP[i-1][j])
