===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Initialize a 2D DP array where each cell i represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and use nested loops to fill in the table, considering all possible modifications at each step.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max distance after executing i commands with j T's and (n - j) F's.
Consider the last command as 'F', then update the state based on whether it's the first 'T' or not. If it's the first 'T', consider all possible modifications up to that point and take the maximum.

Implement dynamic programming by initializing a 2D DP array and updating it iteratively based on the rules of the problem. For each cell, calculate the maximum distance after executing i commands with j T's and (n - j) F's by considering all possible modifications up to that point and taking the maximum.
