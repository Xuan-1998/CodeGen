===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to maximize the distance, consider using a top-down approach with memoization. Initialize a 2D DP table where each cell (i, j) represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.

Let dp[i][j] be the maximum possible distance from the starting point to the ending point after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.
The base case is when i = 0 or j = 0. In this case, the maximum possible distance is 0 because no commands were executed.

Consider a general case where we have executed k commands (k <= i) and modified at most m commands (m <= j). We can either execute the next command (if it's "F", move forward by 1 unit; if it's "T", turn around) or modify one of the previous modified commands.

Let's say the current command is "F". In this case, we can execute the command and get a distance of k+1. The remaining commands are i-k-1, and the remaining modified commands are j-m-1. We can update dp[i][j] as follows:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], k + 1 + dp[i-k-1][j-m-1])

Now consider the case where we modify one of the previous modified commands. Let's say we modify the m-th command (m <= j). In this case, we can update dp[i][j] as follows:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i-1][j-1])

We need to consider all possible cases and update dp[i][j] accordingly.

Finally, return dp[n][n] as the maximum distance after executing n commands and modifying at most n of them.
