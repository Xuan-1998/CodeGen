===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to maximize the distance, consider using a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming. Initialize a 2D DP table where each cell (i, j) represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.

DP[i][j] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.
The initial state is a tuple (0, 0) representing no executed commands and no modifiable commands. The transition relationship is:
- If command i is 'F', then DP[i][j] = max(DP[i-1][j], DP[i-1][j-1] + 1) if j > 0 else -1.
- If command i is 'T' and j > 0, then DP[i][j] = max(DP[i-1][j], DP[i-1][j-1]).

The base case is when i or j is 0. The maximum distance is either 0 (when no commands are executed) or the maximum distance from the previous state if some commands are executed.
Finally, return DP[n][k] where n is the number of commands and k is the number of modifiable commands.
