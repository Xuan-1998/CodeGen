===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with memoization instead of a top-down approach. Initialize a 2D DP table where each cell (i, j) represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.

DP[i][j] is the maximum possible distance from the starting point to the ending point after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.

Choose state as (i, j) representing the number of remaining commands and the number of commands that can be modified. 

Create a recursive function that uses memoization to store the intermediate results and avoids redundant computation. 

Base cases:
- If there are no more commands or modifications left, return 0.
- If all commands have been executed but some modifications are still available, execute all remaining "F" commands, then modify the last command to turn around if necessary.

Recurrence relation:
- If i is even and j is greater than 0, consider two options: 
    - Modify the current command to move forward (DP[i-1][j-1] + 1) or
    - Turn around and continue from the starting point (DP[i-2][j-1])
- If i is odd, consider two options: 
    - Execute the current "F" command (DP[i-1][j] + 1) or
    - Modify the current command to turn around (DP[i-1][j-1]) 

Memoization:
- Store the results of subproblems in a dictionary to avoid redundant computation.
- Use the dictionary to look up the results of previously computed subproblems.

Edge cases:
- If there are no commands left and some modifications are still available, return 0.
- If all commands have been executed but some modifications are still available, return the total distance travelled so far.
