===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Initialize a 2D DP array where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and using j 'T's, considering all possible modifications at each step.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max distance after executing i commands with j 'T's and (n - j) 'F's. The base case is when i equals 0 or n, in which case the maximum distance is 0.

Consider the last command as 'F', then update the state based on whether it's the first 'T' or not. If it's the first 'T', update dp[i][j] with the maximum of the current value and the value of dp[i-1][j+1] (considering one more 'T') plus 1.

If it's not the first 'T', update dp[i][j] with the maximum of the current value and the value of dp[i-1][j] (no change) or dp[i-1][j-1] (one less 'T').

Consider using memoization to store intermediate results and reduce computational complexity. This can be achieved by sorting the commands based on the number of 'T's and 'F's, then processing them in this order.

This approach ensures that when calculating dp[i][j], all possible modifications have been considered up to the i-th command.
