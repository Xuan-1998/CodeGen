===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to maximize the distance, consider using a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming and memoization. Initialize a 3D DP table where each cell (i, j, k) represents the maximum distance after executing i commands, modifying at most j of them, and having made exactly k forward movements.

DP[i][j][k] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands, modifying at most j of them, and having made exactly k forward movements.
The current state is a tuple (i, j, k) representing the number of executed commands, the number of modifiable commands, and the number of forward movements. The transition relationship is:

DP[i][j][k] = max(
    DP[i-1][j][k],  // If the current command is 'T', no movement happens
    DP[i-1][j-1][k] + 1 if command i is 'F' and j > 0 else -1,  // If the current command is 'F', move forward and update modifiable commands
    DP[i-1][j][k-1] if command i is 'T' and k > 0 else -1  // If the current command is 'T' and we've already moved forward, turn around
)

Use a dictionary to store the maximum distance for each state and use bottom-up dynamic programming with memoization to avoid repeated computations.

Initialize the base case DP[0][j][k] = 0, representing that the turtle has not moved yet.
Finally, return the maximum value in the DP table, which represents the maximum distance the turtle can travel from the starting point.
