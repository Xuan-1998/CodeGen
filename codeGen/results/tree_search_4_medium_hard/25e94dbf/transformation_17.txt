===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a top-down approach with memoization. Initialize a 2D DP table where each cell (i, j) represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.

DP[i][j] is the maximum possible distance from the starting point to the ending point after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.

Choose state as (i, j) representing the number of remaining commands and the number of commands that can be modified.
Use a 2D table to store the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.

For each cell DP[i][j], calculate the maximum distance by considering all possible modifications:

1. If no modification is made, the maximum distance is simply the result of executing i commands without any modifications (DP[i-1][0]).
2. If one "T" command is modified to "F", add the distance traveled when moving forward 1 unit and consider the remaining commands as DP[i-1][j-1].
3. If one "F" command is modified to "T", add the distance traveled when turning around and consider the remaining commands as DP[i-1][j-1].

Store the maximum of these two cases in DP[i][j]. The final answer will be stored in DP[n][n].

This plan takes into account all possible modifications, considering both forward movement and turns. It also handles edge cases where i or j is 0.
