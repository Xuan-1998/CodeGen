===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by identifying the subproblems as:
given a set of n commands, find the maximum distance that can be reached by modifying exactly k commands.

This is an optimal substructure since we only consider the maximum possible distance.
The state expression could be:
dp[k] = maximum_distance_reachable(k, n) for k in range(n+1), 
where k represents the total number of commands that have been processed so far.

dp[k] = max(distance_reachable(k, n)) for k in range(n+1), 
where k represents the total number of commands that have been processed so far.

Memoization can be used by defining a recursive function that uses a dictionary to store the results of subproblems as they are solved.
To solve this problem, we will iterate through all possible combinations of modifying exactly k commands, where k is from 0 to n. 
For each combination, calculate the maximum distance reachable and update dp[k] accordingly.

The base case for this recursive function would be when k equals 0 or n. In these cases, dp[k] should be calculated based on whether any modification can be made or not.
dp[0] = 0 (no commands can be modified), 
dp[n] = total_distance_reachable(n) (all commands are unmodified)

The recursive case would involve calculating the maximum distance reachable by modifying exactly k-1 commands, then adding the distance of one command based on whether it's a "T" or "F".
The final answer would be dp[n].
