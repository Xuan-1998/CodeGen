===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Initialize a 2D DP array where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and exactly j of them are 'T' commands.

Define the state as dp[i][j] = maximum distance after executing i commands, considering that exactly j of them are 'T' commands.
Fill in the table by considering all possible modifications at each step:
- If the current command is 'F', update dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1]) + 1
- If the current command is 'T', consider two cases: 
    - Update dp[i][1] = min(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1])
    - Update dp[i][0] = max(0, dp[i-1][1]-1)
Return the maximum value in the last column of the table as the final answer.
