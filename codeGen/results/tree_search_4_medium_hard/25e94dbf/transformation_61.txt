===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Initialize a 2D DP array where each cell dp[i][j] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and exactly j 'T' commands are used.

Define the state as dp[i][j] = maximum distance after executing i commands, considering that exactly j of them are 'T' commands.

Initialize the base case dp[0][0] = 0 because if no command is executed, the turtle stays at the starting point.

Fill in the DP array using a loop to consider all possible modifications at each step:

* For each command (i, j), calculate the maximum distance by considering three options:
    + If the current command is 'F', add its unit distance to the maximum distance of executing i-1 commands without this command.
    + If the current command is 'T', it can be either used or not. Calculate the maximum distance in these two cases and take the maximum.
    + If the current command is not modified, use the maximum distance of executing i-1 commands with the same number of 'T' commands.

Use a loop to fill in the DP array, considering all possible modifications at each step.

Avoid using recursion and instead use iteration to fill the DP array.

Return the last cell dp[n][k] as the maximum distance after executing n commands, where k is the optimal number of 'T' commands used.
