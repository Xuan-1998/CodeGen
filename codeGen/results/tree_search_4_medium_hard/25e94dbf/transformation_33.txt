===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by identifying the subproblems as: given a set of n commands, find the maximum distance that can be reached by modifying exactly k commands. This is an optimal substructure since we only consider the maximum possible distance.

The state expression could be dp[k] = maximum_distance_reachable(k, n) for k in range(n+1), where k represents the total number of commands that have been processed so far.

We need to initialize the dp array with a value representing the starting point, and then fill it up recursively based on the following rules:

- If k == 0, the maximum distance reachable is 0
- Otherwise, we consider two cases: either the current command is "F" (move forward) or it's "T" (turn around). We calculate the maximum distance in both cases and take the maximum.

Here's how to update the dp array:

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 if i == j else dp[i-1][j], for i in range(n+1) and j in range(k+1).

We also need to keep track of the maximum distance reachable for each number of commands processed, so we initialize an array distances = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

The final answer is the maximum value in the dp array.
