===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by identifying the subproblems as:
    - Given a set of n commands, find the maximum distance that can be reached by modifying exactly k commands.
This is an optimal substructure since we only consider the maximum possible distance.

The state expression could be dp[k] = maximum_distance_reachable(k, n) for k in range(n+1), where k represents the total number of commands that have been processed so far.

The base case could be dp[0] = 0, as no modifications are made when k is 0.
For k > 0, the state equation can be:
    - If the last command is 'T', then dp[k] = max(dp[k-1], distance_reachable(k-1, n))
    - If the last command is 'F', then dp[k] = dp[k-1] + 1

The problem can be solved by initializing dp with dp[0] and filling up the rest of the table using the state equation.

A hybrid approach combining both tabulation and memoization can also be explored to improve performance.
