===BEGIN PLAN===
Initialize a 2D DP table where each cell (i, j) represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.

Let's define the transition relationship: 
DP[i][j] = max(DP[i-1][j], 
                DP[i-1][j-1] + (command_i == 'F'? 1 : -DP[i-1][j])
               )

This represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them. If command i is 'F', increment the distance by 1; if not, decrement the distance by DP[i-1][j].

Use a bottom-up approach with tabulation to fill in the DP table.

Base cases: 
DP[0][j] = 0 (no commands executed)
DP[i][0] = 0 (no modifications allowed)
