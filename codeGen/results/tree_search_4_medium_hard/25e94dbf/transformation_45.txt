===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by identifying the subproblems as:
  given a set of n commands, find the maximum distance that can be reached by modifying exactly k commands.
  This is an optimal substructure since we only consider the maximum possible distance
The state expression could be dp[i][j][direction] = max_distance_reachable(i, j, direction) 
  for i in range(len(commands)), j in range(1, 51), and direction in {'T', 'F'}, 
  where direction represents the current direction of the turtle.
dp[j] = max_distance_reachable(len(commands), j) 
  for j in range(1, 51), where dp[j] represents the maximum distance reachable after modifying exactly j commands
Employ a recursive function with memoization to compute the maximum distance reachable after modifying exactly j commands.
For each command:
  - If the command is 'T', update the direction and calculate the new position
  - If the command is 'F', move forward and calculate the new position
Memoize the results for subproblems and use them to avoid redundant calculations
Compute the maximum distance reachable after modifying exactly j commands by iterating over all possible directions and calculating the maximum distance in each case
Return dp[j] as the result, which represents the maximum distance reachable after modifying exactly j commands
