===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by identifying the subproblems as: given a set of n commands, find the maximum distance that can be reached by modifying exactly k commands. This is an optimal substructure since we only consider the maximum possible distance.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max_distance_reachable(i, j), where i represents the current command index and j is the number of commands that can be modified.

dp[i][k] = max(dp[i-1][k], dp[i-1][max(0, k-1)] + |command[i]|)

where |command[i]| is either 1 for 'F' or -1 for 'T'

Use a 2D array to store the maximum distance reachable for each command index and number of commands that can be modified.

For initialization: dp[0][j] = 0, for all j (since we start from the beginning)

For the base case: dp[i][0] = 0, for all i (since we cannot modify any commands when k=0)

The updated plan includes edge cases:
- When k=0, the maximum distance reachable is always 0
- When i=0, there are no commands left to modify

To improve the plan: 
- Add more base cases if necessary
- Optimize the recursive formula by avoiding redundant computations
- Use a bottom-up approach instead of top-down for faster computation

The plan does not include edge cases:
- What happens when n is 0?
- What happens when command[i] is neither 'T' nor 'F'?

Update the plan to handle these edge cases.
