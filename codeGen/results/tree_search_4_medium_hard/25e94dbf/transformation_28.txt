===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by identifying the subproblems as: given a set of n commands, find the maximum distance that can be reached by modifying exactly k commands. This is an optimal substructure since we only consider the maximum possible distance.

The state expression could be dp[k] = max_distance_reachable(k, n) for k in range(n+1), where k represents the total number of commands that have been processed so far.
dp[k] = max(dp[k-1], 2*distance_reachable(k, n)) if k > 0

Dynamic programming can be implemented using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Create a 2D table dp[][] and fill it according to the problem's constraints.

Initialize dp[0][j] = j for all j in range(n+1) since no commands have been processed yet, and the maximum distance reachable is equal to the number of commands.
Then for each k from 1 to n, compute dp[k][j] as follows:
- If j < k, set dp[k][j] = dp[k-1][k-j] because we can't modify more commands than we have left
- Else if j == k, set dp[k][j] = max(dp[k-1][j], 2*distance_reachable(k, n)) because at this point we can either not modify any command (dp[k-1][j]) or modify all remaining commands to move forward and backward (2*distance_reachable(k, n))
- Else set dp[k][j] = max(dp[k-1][j], 2*distance_reachable(k, n)) because at this point we can either not modify any command (dp[k-1][j]) or modify all remaining commands to move forward and backward (2*distance_reachable(k, n))

Finally, the maximum distance reachable is dp[n][n]
