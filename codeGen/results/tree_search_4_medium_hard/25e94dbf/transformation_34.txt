===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by identifying the subproblems as: given a set of n commands, find the maximum distance that can be reached by modifying exactly k commands, for all k in range(n+1). This is an optimal substructure since we only consider the maximum possible distance.

The state expression could be dp[k] = maximum_distance_reachable(k, n) for k in range(n+1), where k represents the total number of commands that have been processed so far. The base case would be when k == 0, which means no commands are modified and the maximum distance reached is 0.

state: (k, i), transition: dp[k][i] = max(dp[k-1][i-1] + 1 if i == k else dp[k-1][i], for k in range(n+1) and i in range(k+1)). 

Using a bottom-up approach, fill the dynamic programming table in a bottom-up manner by processing all possible subproblems.

Firstly, we initialize dp[0] = [0] * (n + 1). Then, for each k from 1 to n, we update dp[k] using the following recurrence:

- If i < k, then dp[k][i] = dp[k-1][i]
- If i == k, then dp[k][k] = 1
- For all other values of i in range(k), we have dp[k][i] = max(dp[k-1][i-1] + 1, dp[k-1][i])

Finally, the maximum distance reachable by modifying exactly n commands is given by dp[n][n].
