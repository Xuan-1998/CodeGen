===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by identifying the subproblems as: given a set of n commands, find the maximum distance that can be reached by modifying exactly k commands. This is an optimal substructure since we only consider the maximum possible distance.

The state expression could be dp[i][j][direction] = max_distance_reachable(i, j, direction) for i in range(len(commands)), j in range(1, 51), and direction in {'T', 'F'}, where direction represents the current direction of the turtle.

dp[i][j] = max_distance_reachable(i, j) for i in range(len(commands)), j in range(1, 51), where dp[i][j] represents the maximum distance reachable after executing the first i commands with exactly j modifications

The base case would be when i == 0, dp[0][j] = 0 for all j, since we haven't executed any commands yet.

To compute dp[i][j], we can consider two possibilities: either the current command is 'T' and we turn around, or it's 'F' and we move forward. In both cases, we need to decide whether to modify this command (i.e., make it a different direction) or leave it as is.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 if the current command is 'T', dp[i-1][j+1] + 1 if the current command is 'F'), where we choose the maximum distance reachable after executing the first i-1 commands with exactly j-1 or j+1 modifications.

Finally, the maximum distance reachable after executing all n commands is dp[n][k], where k is the number of modifications allowed.
