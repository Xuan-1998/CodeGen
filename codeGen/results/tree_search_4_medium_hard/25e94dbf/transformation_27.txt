===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by identifying the subproblems as: given a set of n commands, find the maximum distance that can be reached by modifying exactly k commands. This is an optimal substructure since we only consider the maximum possible distance.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max_distance_reachable(i, j), where i represents the current command index and j is the number of commands that can be modified.

dp[i][k] = max(dp[i-1][k], dp[i-1][max(0, k-1)] + |command[i]|)

Apply memoization using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems, where the keys are tuples representing the current command index and number of commands that can be modified.

Let's analyze the plan step by step:

1. The problem is indeed an optimal substructure problem, making it suitable for dynamic programming.
2. The state expression dp[i][j] captures the idea of considering the maximum distance reachable given the current command index i and the number of commands that can be modified j.
3. The transition function dp[i][k] = max(dp[i-1][k], dp[i-1][max(0, k-1)] + |command[i]|) is correct. It considers two options: either modify the current command (dp[i-1][k]) or don't modify it and move forward/backward according to the current command.
4. The use of memoization with a dictionary will help avoid redundant computations by storing the results of subproblems.

As for potential issues:

* Edge cases are not explicitly handled, but this can be done by considering base cases (e.g., when i or j is 0) and adjusting the transition function accordingly.
* There might be some edge cases where k > i, which would require additional handling. However, since k <= n and n is relatively small, this issue might not affect the overall solution.

Overall, the plan looks solid, but it's always a good idea to double-check and refine it based on specific implementation details.
