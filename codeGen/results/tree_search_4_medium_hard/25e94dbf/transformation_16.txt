===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming. Initialize a 2D DP table where each cell (i, k) represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most k of them.

DP[i][k] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands, considering all possible ways to modify at most k commands.

The state can be represented as a tuple (i, k), where i is the current number of commands executed and k is the remaining number of modifications allowed. The transition relationship can be formulated as:

DP[i][k] = max({
    DP[i-1][k-1] + 1 if the i-th command is 'F' and modification allowed,
    DP[i-1][k] if the i-th command is 'T' and modification allowed,
    DP[i-1][k-1] if the i-th command is 'T' and no more modifications are left
})

Memoization function can be implemented using recursion with base case handling and memo dictionary to store intermediate results.

For edge cases, consider initializing DP[0][j] = 0 for all j, since the maximum distance after executing 0 commands is 0. Also, initialize DP[i][0] = 0 for all i, since modifying no commands does not change the distance.

Initialize memo dictionary with default value as negative infinity to handle cases where the state has never been reached before.
