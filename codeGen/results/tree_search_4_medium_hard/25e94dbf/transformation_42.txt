===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by identifying the subproblems as:
given a set of n commands, find the maximum distance that can be reached by modifying exactly k commands.

This is an optimal substructure since we only consider the maximum possible distance reachable from each position.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max_distance_reachable(i, j) for i in range(len(commands)), j in range(1, n+1), where dp[i][j] represents the maximum distance reachable after executing the first i commands with exactly j modifications.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 if the last command is 'F' else -∞) for i in range(1, len(commands)), j in range(1, n+1), where dp[i-1][j-1] represents the maximum distance reachable after executing the first i-1 commands with exactly j-1 modifications.

Dynamically generate a memoization dictionary to store the intermediate results for faster lookup.

For edge cases:
- The initial state is dp[0][0] = 0, representing that no commands have been executed and no modifications have been made.
- If all 'T' commands are executed before reaching the end of the sequence, then we should stop at that point. We can represent this by adding a condition to check if the last command is 'T', if so, return -∞.
