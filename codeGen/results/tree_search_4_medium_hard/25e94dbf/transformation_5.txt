===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to maximize the distance, consider using a top-down approach with memoization and pruning. Initialize a 2D DP table where each cell (i, j) represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.

DP[i][j] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.
The current state is a tuple (i, j) representing the total distance traveled and the number of modifiable commands. The transition relationship is:

* If command i is 'F', DP[i][j] = max(DP[i-1][j], DP[i-1][j-1] + 1)
* Else, DP[i][j] = -DP[i-1][j]

Use a hybrid approach combining top-down memoization with bottom-up tabulation, initializing the DP table as a 2D array and using memoization to optimize the calculation.

To prune the search space, consider only exploring the transitions that increase the distance traveled. This is because we are trying to maximize the distance.
To handle edge cases, initialize the base case for i=0 as [0][j] = 0 for all j, representing the starting point.
