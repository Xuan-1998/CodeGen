===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by identifying the subproblems as:
given a set of n commands, find the maximum distance that can be reached by modifying exactly k commands.
This is an optimal substructure since we only consider the maximum possible distance

The state expression could be dp[k] = maximum_distance_reachable(k, n) for k in range(n+1), where k represents the total number of commands that have been processed so far.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 if i == j else dp[i-1][j], 
               for i in range(n+1) and j in range(k+1).

dp = [[0 for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]

However, we can optimize the state expression by removing the dependency on k. We can observe that the maximum distance reachable with a certain number of commands is equal to the maximum distance reachable with one less command plus 1 (if we turn around) or the maximum distance reachable with the same number of commands (if we move forward).

So, the updated plan would be:

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] + 1 if i % 2 == 0 else dp[i], 
            for i in range(n+1)).

This approach ensures that each subproblem is solved only once and its solution can be used to solve other subproblems, making the dynamic programming approach efficient.
