===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with memoization instead of top-down. Initialize a 2D DP table where each cell (i, j) represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.

DP[i][j] is the maximum possible distance from the starting point to the ending point after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.

The transition relationship could be defined as: 
    if i == 0:
        DP[i][j] = 1
    elif command[i-1] == 'F':
        DP[i][j] = max(DP[i-1][k-1] + 1, DP[i-1][j]) for k ranging from 0 to min(i, j)
    else: 
        DP[i][j] = max(DP[i-1][k-1], DP[i-1][j]) for k ranging from 0 to min(i, j)

Implement a priority queue to prioritize the maximum distance gain from each command modification and choose the best option at each step.

For edge cases, consider what happens when n is close to i. In this case, we might need to modify more commands than initially allowed. Consider handling these cases separately or adjusting the transition relationship accordingly.
