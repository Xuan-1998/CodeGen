===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by identifying the subproblems as: given a set of n commands, find the maximum distance that can be reached by modifying exactly k commands.

The state expression could be dp[i][j] = max_distance_reachable(i, j) for i in range(len(commands)), j in range(1, 51), where dp[i][j] represents the maximum distance reachable after processing i commands and allowing up to j modifications. This is an optimal substructure since we only consider the maximum possible distance.

We can use a dictionary to store the dynamic programming values and update them iteratively based on the problem constraints: 
- If the current command is 'T', we need to reverse the direction of the turtle, so we subtract the distance travelled by the turtle in the current direction from the maximum distance reachable.
- If the current command is 'F', we simply add the distance of one step to the maximum distance reachable.

We can also use a variable max_distance to keep track of the maximum distance reachable after processing all commands and allowing up to j modifications. This will allow us to find the maximum distance reachable by modifying exactly k commands for different values of k.

The final answer would be dp[-1][n], which represents the maximum distance reachable after processing all commands and allowing up to n modifications.
