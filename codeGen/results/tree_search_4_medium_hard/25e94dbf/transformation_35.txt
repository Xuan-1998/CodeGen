===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by identifying the subproblems as: given a set of n commands, find the maximum distance that can be reached by modifying exactly k commands. This is an optimal substructure since we only consider the maximum possible distance.

The state expression could be dp[k] = maximum_distance_reachable(k, n) for k in range(n+1), where k represents the total number of commands that have been processed so far.

state: (k, i), transition: dp[k][i] = max(dp[k-1][i-1] + 1 if i == k else dp[k-1][i], for k in range(n+1) and i in range(k+1)).

Use a top-down approach to build the memoization dictionary by solving larger problems first and storing the results for smaller problems.

However, this plan needs some adjustments. We can start by initializing the dynamic programming table dp with zeros or negative infinity. Then we need to consider how the "T" command affects our state transition.

We can create a function that calculates the maximum distance reachable after processing k commands, considering that exactly i of those k commands are modified. This could be done using a recursive approach and memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
