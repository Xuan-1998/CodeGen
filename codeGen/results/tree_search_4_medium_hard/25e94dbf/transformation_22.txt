This plan correctly captures the idea of using a top-down approach with memoization to solve the problem. By initializing the DP table and iteratively computing values for each cell based on previously calculated ones, we can efficiently find the maximum distance.

One potential issue with this plan is that it doesn't handle edge cases properly. For instance, what if n is greater than the length of commands? We would need to add some checks to ensure that our DP table is initialized correctly and that we don't try to access indices outside the bounds of our arrays.

Another improvement could be made by adding a base case for when j = 0 (i.e., no modifications allowed). This would help avoid unnecessary calculations and improve performance.

The plan does include edge cases, such as handling the first command ('F' or 'T') and dealing with indices outside the bounds of our arrays.
