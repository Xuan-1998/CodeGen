===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by identifying the subproblems as: given a set of n commands, find the maximum distance that can be reached by modifying exactly k commands. This is an optimal substructure since we only consider the maximum possible distance.

The state expression could be dp[k] = maximum_distance_reachable(k, n) for k in range(n+1), where k represents the total number of commands that have been processed so far.

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1] + 1 if i == j else dp[i-1][j], for i in range(n+1) and j in range(k+1).

memo = {(0,): 0}

The plan seems correct, but it could be improved by initializing the memo dictionary with base cases.

For example, we can set memo[(0, k)] to k for all k in range(n+1), because if there are no commands, the maximum distance that can be reached is 0. This way, we ensure that the base case is correctly handled and we avoid infinite recursion when k is 0.

Another potential issue with this plan is that it does not consider edge cases. For example, what happens if n is 0? In this case, the problem statement does not specify what to do in such a scenario. However, we can handle this by setting dp[k] = 0 for all k in range(n+1) when n is 0.

The plan does include edge cases like handling the base cases and initialization of memo dictionary.
