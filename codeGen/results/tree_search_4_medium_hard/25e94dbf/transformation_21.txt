===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to maximize the distance, consider using a top-down approach with memoization. Initialize a 3D DP table where each cell (i, j, k) represents the maximum distance after executing i commands, modifying at most j of them, and considering up to k forward movements.

DP[i][j][k] is the maximum possible distance from the starting point to the ending point after executing i commands, modifying at most j of them, and considering up to k forward movements.

Define a 3D DP table where each cell DP[i][j][k] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands, modifying at most j of them, and considering up to k forward movements. Consider using memoization to store previously computed values in a dictionary, where keys are tuples representing the current command index, the number of modified commands, and the forward movement count, and values are the corresponding maximum distances.

Initialize the DP table with base cases: DP[0][j][k] = 0 for all j and k, since we start at the origin (0 distance). For i > 0, consider two possible scenarios:

1. The current command is "F" (move forward), so consider up to k - 1 forward movements.
2. The current command is "T" (turn around), which resets the forward movement count.

Use memoization to store previously computed values and avoid redundant calculations. Finally, return the maximum distance in DP[n][n][k] for some suitable k.
