===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Initialize a 2D DP array dp where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and j T's, considering all possible modifications at each step.

State expression: dp[i][j] = max distance after executing i commands with j T's and (n - j) F's.
dp[i][j] = 
    max(
        if j > 0:
            dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
        else:
            dp[i-1][j] - 1,
        dp[i-1][j]
    )

Create a 2D DP table where each cell [i][j] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands with j T's and (n - j) F's.
dp[0][0] = 0 // initial state

Filling the DP table:
for i from 1 to m: 
    for j from 0 to n:
        if command[i-1] == 'T':
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1] + 1)
        else:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] - 1
