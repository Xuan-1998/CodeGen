===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by identifying the subproblems as:
given a set of n commands, find the maximum distance that can be reached by modifying exactly k commands.
This is an optimal substructure since we only consider the maximum possible distance.

state: dp[k] = maximum_distance_reachable(k, n) for k in range(n+1), where k represents the total number of commands that have been processed so far.
transition: 
    if k == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        max_dist = 0
        for i in range(min(k, len(commands))):
            if commands[i] == "F":
                dist = dp[k-1][i-1] + 1
                if dist > max_dist:
                    max_dist = dist
        return max_dist

Create a nested loop structure using two loops to iterate over the commands and the number of modifications.
for k in range(n+1):
    for i in range(k+1):
        dp[k][i] = transition(dp, k, i)
