===BEGIN PLAN===
DP[i][j] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them. Initialize the DP table with zeros.

For each command in the input string:
  - If the command is 'F', update DP[i][j] = max(DP[i-1][j], DP[i-1][j-1] + 1) if j > 0, else update DP[i][j] = DP[i-1][j].
  - If the command is 'T', update DP[i][j] = max(DP[i-1][j], DP[i-1][j-1] - 1) if j > 0, else update DP[i][j] = DP[i-1][j].

Return DP[m][n] as the maximum distance.
