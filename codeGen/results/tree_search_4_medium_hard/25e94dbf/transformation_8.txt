===BEGIN PLAN===
Since we need to maximize the distance, consider using a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming. Initialize a 2D DP table where each cell (i, j) represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.

DP[i][j] represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and modifying at most j of them.

The current state is a tuple (i, j) representing the number of modifiable commands and whether to turn around or move forward. The transition relationship can be defined as follows:

* If command i is 'T', then DP[i][j] = 2 * max(DP[i-1][j], DP[i-1][j-1]) if j > 0, because we can either turn around and stay at the current position or modify one of the previous commands to move forward.
* If command i is 'F', then DP[i][j] = DP[i-1][j] + 1 if j > 0, because we can always move forward without modifying any previous commands.

We start filling in the DP table from the base cases: DP[0][j] = 0 for all j, since there are no commands to execute. Then, we fill in the rest of the table row by row, starting from the bottom.

Finally, the maximum distance is stored at DP[n][n], where n is the total number of commands.
