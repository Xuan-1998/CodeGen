===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by identifying the subproblems as:
    given a set of n commands, find the maximum distance that can be reached by modifying exactly k commands.
This is an optimal substructure since we only consider the maximum possible distance
The state expression could be dp[i][j][direction] = max_distance_reachable(i, j, direction) for i in range(len(commands)), j in range(1, 51), and direction in {'T', 'F'}, where direction represents the current direction of the turtle.
dp[i][j][direction] represents the maximum distance reachable after executing the first i commands with exactly j modifications and currently facing direction
The base case would be when i == len(commands) and j == 0, then return 0 (no more commands to execute)
The recurrence relation could be:
    if i == 0:
        return 0
    elif j > 0:
        dp[i][j][direction] = max(dp[i-1][j-1]['T' if direction == 'F' else 'F'], dp[i-1][j-1][direction])
    else:
        dp[i][j][direction] = 1 + dp[i-1][j]['T' if direction == 'F' else 'F']
Memoize the recursive function calls to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.
