===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by identifying the subproblems as:
given a set of n commands, find the maximum distance that can be reached by modifying exactly k commands.

This is an optimal substructure since we only consider the maximum possible distance
The state expression could be dp[i][j][direction] = max_distance_reachable(i, j, direction) for i in range(len(commands)), j in range(1, 51), and direction in {'T', 'F'}, where direction represents the current direction of the turtle.

Create a bottom-up dynamic programming solution using a 3D table, where the dimensions are command index, number of modifications, and current direction.
For each state dp[i][j][direction], we consider two options:
- execute the next command in the given direction
- modify the current command to 'T' or 'F'

The base case for our dynamic programming solution is when i == 0. In this case, dp[0][j][direction] = 0 for all j and direction.

To fill up the table, we iterate through each state dp[i][j][direction] and consider both options:

- execute the next command in the given direction: We check if the current command is 'T' or 'F', and update the distance accordingly.
- modify the current command to 'T' or 'F': We check which option gives us a greater distance, considering all possible directions.

Finally, we return dp[len(commands)][n]['F'] as the maximum distance reachable after executing all commands with exactly n modifications.
