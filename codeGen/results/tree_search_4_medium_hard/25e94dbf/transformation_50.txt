===BEGIN PLAN===
Consider using a bottom-up approach with tabulation. Initialize a 1D DP array where each cell i represents the maximum distance after executing i commands and use a loop to fill in the table, considering all possible modifications at each step.

The state expression could be dp[i] = max distance after executing i commands. The recurrence relation is:

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] + 1 if last command was F else - 1), dp[i-1])

Memoize by using a dictionary to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant computations.

For each prefix of length j, calculate the maximum distance after executing j commands. Use a loop to fill in the table:

dp[0] = 0
for i from 1 to len(commands):
    dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] + 1 if commands[i-1] is 'F' else - 1), dp[i-1])

Finally, return dp[n], which represents the maximum distance after executing n commands.

===END PLAN===
