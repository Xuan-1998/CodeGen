===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we break down the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved independently, but share some common information? If yes, dynamic programming with top-down approach using memoization might be suitable.

The state is the current stone index i and the maximum distance d such that the frog has not jumped beyond this distance. The base case remains the same: when i is equal to the number of stones - 1, indicating that the frog has reached the end of the river.

To make the problem more manageable, we can consider two subproblems:

1. Whether the frog can reach stone at index j from stone at index i.
2. Whether the frog can jump k units forward from stone at index i.

The recurrence relation would be: the frog can reach stone at index j if and only if there is a previous stone at index i that is within jumping distance (k-1, k, or k+1) of stone at index j, and the frog can reach this previous stone.

Memoize the state with (i, d) as a tuple. The dynamic programming table dp[i][d] would represent whether the frog can reach the stone at index i starting from distance d.

The base case remains the same: when i is equal to the number of stones - 1, indicating that the frog has reached the end of the river.

Finally, check if the state (0, 0) is true, which means the frog can cross the river. If not, return false.
