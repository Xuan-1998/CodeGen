===BEGIN PLAN===
The state of the frog is defined by its current position and previous jump length. We can express this in a mathematical formula as follows:

dp[i][0] represents the frog's current position
dp[i][1] represents the frog's previous jump length
dp[i][2] represents the remaining stones to be crossed

The base case for dp[0] is that it's always possible for the frog to reach stone 0 (since there are no previous jumps).

For each subsequent stone, we can calculate whether it's possible to reach that stone by considering all previous jumps:

dp[i][2] = len(stones) - i
dp[i][0] = stones[i]
dp[i][1] = (stones[i] - stones[i-1]) % 3

We then fill in the dp table based on this formula, starting from the first stone.

The answer is whether it's possible to reach the last stone, which we can determine by checking if dp[-1][2] == 0 (i.e., all stones have been crossed).
