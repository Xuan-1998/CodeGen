===BEGIN PLAN===
We can model each possible sequence of jumps as a separate subproblem. Can we find a way to combine these subproblems to form the solution?
The state expression could be defined as: dp[i] = True if the frog can reach stone i, False otherwise. The base case would be dp[0] = True since the frog starts on the first stone.
dp[i] represents whether the frog can reach the ith stone after making at most one jump. The transition relationship is then dp[i+1] = any of the previous stones j such that |i-j| == k-1, k, or k+1 and dp[j] is True
We can use a bottom-up approach with dynamic programming, where we initialize dp as a list of False values of length n+1 and then update each dp[i] based on the previous stones that can be reached.
For edge cases, we need to ensure that the first stone's position is always 0. We also need to handle the case where k is either 1 or -1 (which means the frog can only jump forward or backward by 1 unit).
