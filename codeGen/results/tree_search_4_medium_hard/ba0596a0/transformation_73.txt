dp[0] = True
For each stone position i in the input list:
    If i is 0, dp[i] = True (since we can always reach the first stone)
    Else: 
        For each previous stone position j such that 0 <= j < i:
            Check if it's possible to reach the current stone from the previous stone with a jump of k-1, k, or k+1
            If yes, dp[i] = True
        dp[i] = min(dp[i-k-1], dp[i-k], dp[i-k+1]) if i > 0
