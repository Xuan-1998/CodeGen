===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use dynamic programming with tabulation, where we fill up a table with solutions to smaller subproblems and then use them to solve larger ones? Yes, this approach seems correct for this problem. 

The state is dp[i] = True/False indicating whether the frog can reach stone i, with dp[0] = True as the base case.

dp[i] represents whether the frog can reach the ith stone by considering all previous stones (including itself) and jumping distances of k-1, k, and k+1. This makes sense because we want to know if the frog can jump from the current stone to the next one.

Use a dictionary memo to store previously computed values and update the memo as we go through the stones. This helps in avoiding redundant computations which is important for dynamic programming.

Let's iterate over all the stones and calculate dp[i]. For each i, check all previous stones j such that j <= i - k-1 or j >= i-k+1 (since these are the possible jumping distances). 

If any of these jumps can lead to a successful reach of stone i, then set dp[i] = True. If no jump leads to a successful reach, then set dp[i] = False.

Finally, check if dp[-1] is True. If it's true, then the frog can cross all stones; otherwise, it cannot.

This plan seems correct and should be able to solve this problem efficiently.
