===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i] = (dp[i-1] or (min(j in 0..i-1 | d-j+1 <= k) and dp[min(j in 0..i-1 | d-j+1 <= k)]))
where 0<=j<i and k is a given constant, with base case dp[0] = True
DP table with combination of both: Create a 1D array where each element represents whether it's possible for the frog to reach the corresponding stone. Fill up the table by checking if it's possible for the frog to reach the current stone from previous stones, considering different jump distances.
Use dynamic programming approach with 1D array, where each element dp[i] represents whether it's possible for the frog to reach the ith stone.
