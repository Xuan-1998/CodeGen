===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i] = dp[j] and k == (stones[i]- stones[j-1]) % 3
dp[i] should be defined as a tuple of the frog's current position, previous jump length, and the remaining stones to be crossed.

Maintain a dictionary memo where keys are tuples representing the state of the frog and values are boolean indicating whether the frog can cross the river at that position. 

Update dp[i] based on dp[j] if the frog can reach i from j with valid jumps (k-1, k, or k+1). 
The base case is when the frog reaches the last stone.

Edge cases: handle the first stone and the last stone separately.
For the first stone, there are no previous stones to jump from. So, dp[0] = (0, 0, len(stones) - 1). 
For the last stone, the condition becomes dp[i-1][1] == (stones[i]-stones[i-1]) % 3.
