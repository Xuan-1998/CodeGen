===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i] = dp[j] and k == (stones[i]- stones[j-1]) % 3
dp[i] should be defined as a tuple of the frog's current position, previous jump length, and the remaining stones to be crossed.
The state transition function can be defined as:
    - If the current stone is reachable from the previous one, then dp[i] = (stones[i], k, len(stones)-i-1)
    - Otherwise, return False
Determine if the frog can cross the river by solving the problem recursively with memoization.
The base case is when i == len(stones)-1, in which case the frog has crossed the entire river and dp[i] should be True.
Initialize a memo dictionary to store the results of subproblems.
The main function is:
    def can_cross_stones(stones):
        memo = {}
        for i in range(len(stones)):
            if dp(i, 0): # start from the first stone with jump length 0
                return True
        return False
    - If dp[i] exists in the memo dictionary, return its value.
    - Otherwise, calculate dp[i] by calling the recursive function and store it in the memo dictionary before returning its value.
