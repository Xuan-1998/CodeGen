===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Initialize a dynamic programming table dp of size i + 1, where i is the length of the input list.
    Fill up the first element dp[0] = True, since the frog can always cross the first stone.

2. Iterate over the input list from the second stone to the last stone:
    For each stone at position j:
        If the current stone is the last one, set dp[j] = True, because the frog has reached the end.
        Otherwise, calculate dp[j] based on previous stones:
            If there's a previous stone within distance k-1, k, or k+1, and it can be crossed (dp[i]), then the current stone can also be crossed. Set dp[j] = True.
            If no such previous stone exists, set dp[j] = False.

3. Return dp[i], which represents whether the frog can cross the last stone.
