===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we break down the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved independently, but share some common information? If yes, dynamic programming with top-down approach using memoization might be suitable.

The state is the current stone index i. The base case is when i is equal to the number of stones - 1, indicating that the frog has reached the end of the river.

The state can be defined as a tuple (i, last_k), where i is the current stone index and last_k is the distance of the previous jump. The base case remains the same: when i is equal to the number of stones - 1.

Use a dictionary to store the memoized results where the key is a tuple representing the current stone index and the distance of the previous jump, and the value is either True or False indicating whether the frog can reach the end.

Let's analyze each step:

- The plan identifies the correct subproblems (i.e., reaching the end from different stone indices) and defines a suitable state variable (i, last_k).

- The base case correctly handles the terminal condition when the frog reaches the end of the river.

- Using memoization with a dictionary is an effective way to store and reuse previously computed results. This will prevent redundant computation and improve efficiency.

However, there's one potential issue: What if we encounter a situation where the previous jump was k + 1 units but the current stone index i is less than last_k - (k + 1), meaning the frog has "jumps back" to the previous stones? In this case, the state would not be correctly updated in memoization.

To address this issue, we can add a check before updating the memoized result. If the condition is met, it means the frog cannot reach the end from the current stone index i with the given last_k distance, and we should return False immediately. This ensures that our dynamic programming solution remains correct.

Here's the updated plan:
