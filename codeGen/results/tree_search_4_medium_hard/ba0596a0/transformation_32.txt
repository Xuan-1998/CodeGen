===BEGIN PLAN===
We can model each possible sequence of jumps as a separate subproblem. Can we find a way to combine these subproblems to form the solution?

The state expression could be defined as: dp[i] = True if the frog can reach stone i, False otherwise. The base case would be dp[0] = True since the frog starts on the first stone.

dp[i] is a boolean indicating whether the frog can reach the ith stone considering all possible jumps from the previous stones. The transition relationship is then:

    for j in range(i-1, i+2):
        if |i-j| == k-1, k, or k+1 and dp[j] is True:
            dp[i] = True

Use memoization with a recursive function to store intermediate results.

The plan can be improved by reducing the number of recursive calls. This can be done by only considering the stones that are within the reach of the current stone.

One potential issue with the plan is that it does not consider the edge case where k is greater than 1 and the last stone is far away from the first stone, making it impossible for the frog to jump to it.

To include edge cases, we need to handle the scenario where i is equal to n-1 (the last stone). In this case, dp[i] should be True if the frog can reach the last stone and False otherwise. This can be achieved by adding a condition in the base case of the recursive function.
