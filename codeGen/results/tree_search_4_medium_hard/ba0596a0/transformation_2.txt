===BEGIN PLAN===
The state is the current stone index i and the maximum jump distance k. The base case is when i is equal to the number of stones - 1, indicating that the frog has reached the end of the river.

The dynamic programming function dp(i, k) returns a boolean value indicating whether it's possible for the frog to reach the last stone with the given state (i, k). If k is within the bounds of the previous jump distances (k - 1, k, or k + 1), then consider the three possibilities: jumping k - 1 units, k units, or k + 1 units.

The base case remains the same: when i is equal to the number of stones - 1. In this case, return True if the current stone index matches the last stone's position, and False otherwise.

If k is out of bounds (i.e., it's not a valid previous jump distance), then the frog cannot reach the last stone with that state, so return False.

The recursive function would be:

dp(i, k) = 
    if i == number_of_stones - 1: 
        # base case: reached the end of the river
        return True 
    elif k not in (k - 1, k, k + 1): 
        # k is out of bounds, cannot reach the last stone with this state
        return False 
    else:
        # consider three possibilities for jumping
        return dp(i + 1, k - 1) or dp(i + 1, k) or dp(i + 1, k + 1)
