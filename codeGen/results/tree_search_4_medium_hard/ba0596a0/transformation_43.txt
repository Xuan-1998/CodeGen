===BEGIN PLAN===
We can model each possible sequence of jumps as a separate subproblem. 
dp[i] = whether the frog can reach stone i given the position of all previous stones. The base case would be dp[1] = True since there is no previous stone to consider.
For the transition state, we need to consider if it's possible to jump from the (i-1)th stone to the ith stone with a jump distance of k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. This can be achieved by iterating over all previous stones and checking if it's possible to reach the ith stone.
To make this plan more efficient, we can add an additional state dp[j] = whether there is a way to reach the jth stone from the first stone. This would allow us to skip unnecessary checks during our dynamic programming approach.

dp[i] = whether the frog can reach stone i given the position of all previous stones,
    1. If it's possible to jump directly from the (i-1)th stone to the ith stone, then dp[i] = True.
    2. Else, iterate over all previous stones and check if it's possible to reach the ith stone.
        * If it is possible for some previous stone j, then dp[i] = True.
        * Else, dp[i] = False.

Use bottom-up dynamic programming by initializing dp and filling it up iteratively.
