===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i] = True/False indicating whether the frog can reach stone i, with dp[0] = True as the base case.
Let dp[i] be the smallest possible jump that can reach stone i. Then, state and transition relationships would be formulated based on these minimum jumps.

Create a 2D array to represent the minimum jumps needed to reach each stone:

dp[i][j] = True if the frog can reach stone i with j - 1, j, or j + 1 as the previous jump; False otherwise.

Transition rules:
- dp[i][j] is True if and only if there exists k such that dp[k][j - 1], dp[k][j], or dp[k][j + 1] are all True.
- If dp[k][j - 1], dp[k][j], or dp[k][j + 1] are all False, then dp[i][j] is also False.

Base case:
dp[0][k] = True for any k (since the frog starts on stone 0).
