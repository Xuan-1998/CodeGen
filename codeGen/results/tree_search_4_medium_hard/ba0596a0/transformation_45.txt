===BEGIN PLAN===
We can model each possible sequence of jumps as a separate subproblem. 
To solve this problem using Dynamic Programming, we'll fill up a table dp where dp[i] represents whether the frog can reach stone i given the position of all previous stones.

The state expression could be defined as: dp[i] = whether the frog can reach stone i given the position of all previous stones.
The base case would be dp[0] = True since there is no previous stone to consider, meaning we can always start on the first stone.

dp[i] = whether the frog can reach stone i given the position of all previous stones, considering if it's possible to jump from the (i-1)th stone to the ith stone with a jump distance of k - 1, k, or k + 1 units.
We'll iterate over each stone and check if we can reach it by jumping from any of the previous stones. 
If dp[i] is true for some i, then there's at least one possible way to reach that stone.

Employ memoization within an iterative loop to fill up the dp table.
The final answer will be dp[n-1], where n is the total number of stones, which represents whether or not we can reach the last stone without jumping into the water.
