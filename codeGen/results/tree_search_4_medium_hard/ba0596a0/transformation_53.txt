===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use dynamic programming with tabulation, where we fill up a table with solutions to smaller subproblems and then use them to solve larger ones? 
The state is dp[i] = True/False indicating whether the frog can reach stone i, with dp[0] = True as the base case.
dp[i] is True if there exists a jump from dp[j] to dp[i] for some j < i, with a valid jump distance of k-1, k, or k+1. 
To improve this plan:
* Initialize dp with False values initially, so that we can correctly handle the base case.
* Iterate over stones and check each stone's position. If the frog can reach the current stone from previous ones, mark it as True in dp.
* Implement memoization using a dictionary to store and reuse solutions to smaller subproblems.
