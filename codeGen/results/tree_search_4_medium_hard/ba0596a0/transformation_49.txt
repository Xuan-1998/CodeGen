===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use dynamic programming with tabulation, where we fill up a table with solutions to smaller subproblems and then use them to solve larger ones?

The state is dp[i] = True/False indicating whether the frog can reach stone i, with dp[0] = True as the base case.

dp[i] represents whether the frog can reach the ith stone by considering all previous stones (including itself) and jumping distances of k-1, k, and k+1.

dp[i] = (i > 0 and (dp[i - 1] or (i % (k * 2 + 1) == 0 and dp[(i - 1) // k])))
