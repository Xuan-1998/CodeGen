===BEGIN PLAN===
We can model each possible sequence of jumps as a separate subproblem. We can combine these subproblems by considering all valid ways for the frog to jump from the (j-1)th stone to the jth stone.

The state expression could be defined as: dp[j] = True if there is a valid sequence of jumps that allows the frog to jump from the (j-1)th stone to the jth stone. The base case would be dp[0] = True because the frog can simply stay on the first stone, and dp[-1] = False because the frog cannot start jumping.

We use memoization by storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary and look up the solution for each subproblem as needed. We iterate over all stones from j=2 to n-1, and for each stone, we consider all possible jumps that the frog can take. If there is a valid sequence of jumps for any of these possibilities, then dp[j] = True; otherwise, dp[j] = False.

We also need to handle edge cases: if the distance from the first stone to the second stone is less than or equal to k-1, then dp[1] = True. If all stones are too far apart for any sequence of jumps, then return False.
