===BEGIN PLAN===
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems using dynamic programming with top-down approach and memoization.

The state is the current stone index i, and the maximum distance d such that the frog has not jumped beyond this distance. The base case remains the same: when i is equal to the number of stones - 1, indicating that the frog has reached the end of the river.

To solve the problem, implement a top-down recursive memoized function that takes two parameters: the current stone index i and the maximum distance d.

The function should return True if the frog can reach the last stone without jumping into the water, and False otherwise. The base case remains the same: when i is equal to the number of stones - 1, return True.

For other cases, recursively call the function with the next possible stone index (i + k) and update d accordingly. The function should return True if any of these recursive calls return True, and False otherwise.

To improve the plan, consider using a pruning technique to reduce the number of recursive calls. This can be done by checking if it's possible for the frog to jump from the current stone index i to the next stone index (i + k) without jumping into the water. If not, there's no need to continue with the recursive calls.

The potential issue with this plan is that it might cause a stack overflow if the input list has too many stones and the recursive function doesn't prune its calls well enough.

To include edge cases, make sure to handle the base case where i is equal to the number of stones - 1 correctly. Also, consider handling the case where k is equal to 0 (i.e., no jumps are allowed) separately.

Here's an updated version of the plan:
