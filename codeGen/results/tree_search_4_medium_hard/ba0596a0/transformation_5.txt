===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we break down the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved independently, but share some common information? Yes, dynamic programming with top-down approach using memoization might be suitable.

The state is the current stone index i. The base case is when i is equal to the number of stones - 1, indicating that the frog has reached the end of the river.

The state is simply the current stone index i, and the transition relationship can be formulated as a boolean indicating whether it's possible for the frog to reach the next stone given its position.

Use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems, where each key is a tuple representing the current stone index i and the distance from the previous jump k, and the value is a boolean indicating whether it's possible for the frog to reach the next stone.

Consider using an additional variable, say "max_jump", to keep track of the maximum jump size allowed by the problem constraints. This can help in avoiding unnecessary calculations when the frog reaches a point where it cannot make any further jumps.

Handle edge cases such as when i is equal to 0 or when k is less than or equal to 1 (since the frog cannot jump backwards).
