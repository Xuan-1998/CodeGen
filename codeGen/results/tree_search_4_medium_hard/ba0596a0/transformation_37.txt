===BEGIN PLAN===
We can model each possible sequence of jumps as a separate subproblem. To do this efficiently, we can use dynamic programming.

The state expression could be defined as: dp[i] = True if there is a valid sequence of jumps that allows the frog to jump from the (i-1)th stone to the ith stone.

The base case would be dp[0] = False because the frog cannot start jumping before reaching the first stone, and dp[1] = True because the frog can simply stay on the first stone.

To fill in the rest of the dynamic programming table, we iterate through each possible jump length (k-1, k, or k+1) starting from the second stone. For each possible jump length, we check if there is a valid sequence of jumps to reach the current stone by looking at the previous stones. If there is, then we set dp[i] = True; otherwise, we set it to False.

The final answer would be dp[n-1], where n is the number of stones. This indicates whether or not the frog can reach the last stone without jumping into the water.
