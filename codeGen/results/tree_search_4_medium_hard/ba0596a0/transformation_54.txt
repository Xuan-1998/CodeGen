===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i] = True/False indicating whether the frog can reach stone i
dp[0] = True as the base case (the frog starts on the first stone)
For each stone i, check if there exists a jump from dp[j] to dp[i] for some j < i
The valid jump distance is k-1, k, or k+1
If such a jump exists, then dp[i] = True
Otherwise, dp[i] = False
To ensure the frog can reach the last stone without jumping into the water, dp[lastStoneIndex] must be True
