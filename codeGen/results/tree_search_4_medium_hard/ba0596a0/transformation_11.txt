===BEGIN PLAN===
The state of the frog is defined by its current position and previous jump length. We can express this in a mathematical formula as follows:

dp[i] = (stones[i] - stones[i-1]) % 3 == 0 or dp[j] where j is such that stones[j+1]-stones[j] % 3 == (stones[i]-stones[i-1]) % 3

This means, at each stone position i, we check if the current jump distance is 0 or it matches the previous jump distance.

We implement memoization using a dictionary where the key is a tuple representing the state (position and previous jump) and the value is a boolean indicating whether the frog can reach the current position. The base case for our recursion would be when we are at the last stone, in which case the answer is True if it's reachable.

We also need to handle the edge cases where i-1 becomes -1 (when we're at the first stone), and stones[i]-stones[i-1] could be 0 or k-1. We can add a condition dp[0] = True as the base case for our recursion, since it's always possible to reach the first stone.

The plan is updated as follows:

dp[(i, stones[i]-stones[i-1]) % 3] = (stones[i] - stones[i-1]) % 3 == 0 or dp[j] where j is such that stones[j+1]-stones[j] % 3 == (stones[i]-stones[i-1]) % 3

for i in range(1, len(stones)):
    if i == 1:
        dp[(i, 0)] = True
    else:
        for k in range(max(0, stones[i-1]), stones[i]):
            if (k-stones[i-2]) % 3 == (stones[i]-stones[i-1]) % 3:
                dp[(i, k-stones[i-1])] = dp[(i-1, k-stones[i-2])] or True
        dp[(i, stones[i]-stones[i-1])] = any(dp.values())
