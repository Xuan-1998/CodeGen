===BEGIN PLAN===
We can model each possible sequence of jumps as a separate subproblem. Can we find a way to combine these subproblems to form the solution?

The state expression could be defined as: dp[i] = True if the frog can reach stone i, False otherwise. The base case would be dp[0] = True since the frog starts on the first stone.

dp[i] is a boolean indicating whether the frog can reach the ith stone considering all possible jumps from the previous stones. The transition relationship is then:

dp[i] = any i-1 <= j <= i such that |i-j| == k-1, k, or k+1 and dp[j] is True

Define a recursive function to calculate dp[i] and use memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

For each stone position i, consider all possible previous positions j such that the distance between them is k-1, k, or k+1. Check if the frog can reach stone j, and if so, update dp[i] to True.

The final answer would be dp[n-1], where n is the number of stones.

This plan should correctly determine whether the frog can cross the river given a list of non-negative integers representing the positions of stones in ascending order. It includes edge cases as well.
