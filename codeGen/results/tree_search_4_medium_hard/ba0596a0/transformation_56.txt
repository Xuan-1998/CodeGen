1. Initialize dp with all False values (dp is a list of same length as input list)
2. For each stone position i from 0 to n-1:
   - If the frog can reach the previous stone, then dp[i] = True
   - Else if there are at least two stones before the current one and they are k units apart (where k is either 1 or 2), then dp[i] = True
   - Else dp[i] = False
3. Return dp[-1]
