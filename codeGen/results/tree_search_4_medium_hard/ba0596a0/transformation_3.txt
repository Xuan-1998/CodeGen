===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we break down the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved independently, but share some common information? If yes, dynamic programming with bottom-up approach using tabulation might be suitable.

The state is a tuple (i, j) representing whether the frog can reach the jth stone starting from the ith stone. The base case is when i equals the number of stones - 1, indicating that the frog has reached the end of the river.

Let dp[i][j] denote whether the frog can reach the jth stone starting from the ith stone. Then, we have:

dp[i][j] = False if j > stones[-1]

For k in range(i+1, min(j+1, stones[-1]+1)):
    if abs(j - (i + k)) <= k:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i][k]
for k in range(max(0, j-2), i):
    if abs(j - k) == 1 or abs(j - k) == 2:
        dp[i][j] = True

The final answer is dp[0][stones[-1]], which indicates whether the frog can reach the last stone starting from the first stone.
