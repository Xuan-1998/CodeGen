===BEGIN PLAN===
We can model each possible sequence of jumps as a separate subproblem. To combine these subproblems and form the solution, we'll use Dynamic Programming.

The state expression could be defined as: dp[i] = True if the frog can reach stone i, False otherwise. The base case would be dp[0] = True since the frog starts on the first stone.

dp[i] represents whether the frog can reach the ith stone after making at most one jump. The transition relationship is then dp[i+1] = any of the previous stones j such that |i-j| == k-1, k, or k+1 and dp[j] is True

We'll use a bottom-up approach with memoization. Define a recursive function that returns whether the frog can reach a stone, and then update the dp list accordingly.

Update the transition relationship to include edge cases: if i is 0 or 1, return False because the frog cannot jump into the water.

Add an initialization step for dp[0] = True to ensure the base case holds.
