===BEGIN PLAN===
state = (i, k)
transition = min(state), for all valid moves of the frog
dp[i] = True if there is a previous jump that can lead to this state, False otherwise
Let's define two functions:
can_reach(i) = dp[i]
can_hop(j, k) = True if it's possible to reach the stone at index j with a hop length of k, False otherwise

dp[0] = True (start from the first stone)
for i in range(1, len(stones)):
    for k in range(min(3, stones[i]-stones[i-1]), 2):
        if can_reach(i-1) and can_hop(i-1, k) and (stones[i]- stones[i-1]) % 3 == (k-1)%3:
            dp[i] = True
            break
    else:
        dp[i] = False

can_reach(len(stones)-1)
