===BEGIN PLAN===
We can model each possible sequence of jumps as a separate subproblem. We can combine these subproblems using dynamic programming.

The state expression could be defined as: 
dp[i] = whether the frog can reach stone i given the position of all previous stones.

The base case would be dp[1] = True since there is no previous stone to consider.

dp[i] = whether the frog can reach stone i given the position of all previous stones, considering if it's possible to reach the ith stone by jumping from the (i-1)th stone to the ith stone with a jump distance of 1, k, or k + 1 units. This is because the maximum jump distance is k - 1, so we only need to consider the previous stones within this range.

To implement memoization using recursion with a dictionary cache:

dp[i] = (i > 0 and any stone position in the range [i-k-2, i-1] is reachable) or (there's at least one stone in the range [i-k-2, i-1] that's not reachable and it's possible to reach i from the previous stones)

This plan correctly captures the essence of the problem and can be used as a basis for implementation.

The only issue with this plan is that it doesn't consider edge cases. For instance, what if there are no previous stones? What if k=1? These edge cases need to be handled explicitly.

To improve the plan, we could add more detail to the base case and handle edge cases explicitly.
