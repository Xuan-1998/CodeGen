===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i] = min(dp[j]) + 1 for j in range(0, i) if stone[j+1] - stone[j] <= k
and stone[i] - stone[i-1] <= k
use a table to store the minimum number of jumps needed to reach each stone
the state is (i, d) where i is the current stone index and d is the distance from the previous jump, with base cases for i=0 and i=1.
