dp[i] = (dp[i-1] or (exists j such that 0 <= j < i and dp[j] and d-j+1 <= k))

Base case: dp[0] = True
DP table with solutions to smaller subproblems:
Create a 2D array where the first dimension represents the stone index and the second dimension represents the jump distance (k-1, k, or k+1).
Fill up the table by checking if it's possible for the frog to reach the current stone from the previous stones.

Updated version: 
dp[i][j] = (i == 0) || ((i > 0) && (dp[i-1][j] || (exists j' such that 0 <= j' < i and dp[j'][j'-1] and d-j'+2 <= k)))

Base case: dp[0][j] = True
DP table with solutions to smaller subproblems:
Create a 3D array where the first dimension represents the stone index, the second dimension represents the current jump distance, and the third dimension represents the previous jump distance.
Fill up the table by checking if it's possible for the frog to reach the current stone from the previous stones.
