===BEGIN PLAN===
The state of the frog is defined by its current position and previous jump length. We can express this in a mathematical formula as follows:

dp[i] = 1 if stones[i] - stones[j-1] % 3 == k for some j <= i
dp[i] = 0 otherwise

To implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, we initialize an array dp where dp[i] is 1 if the frog can reach the i-th stone, and 0 otherwise. Then, we iterate from i = 2 to n and update dp[i] based on whether the frog can reach the i-th stone with a maximum jump length of k.

We start by setting dp[0] = 1 since the frog can always reach the first stone. Then, for each stone at position stones[i], we check if it's possible to reach this stone from any previous stone j where stones[j-1] is the previous stone. If it is, then we set dp[i] = 1; otherwise, we set dp[i] = 0.

Finally, we return dp[n-1] which indicates whether or not the frog can reach the last stone without jumping into the water.
