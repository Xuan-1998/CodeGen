===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we use dynamic programming with tabulation, where we fill up a table with solutions to smaller subproblems and then use them to solve larger ones? 
The state is dp[i] = True/False indicating whether the frog can reach stone i, with dp[0] = True as the base case. 
dp[i] is True if there exists a jump from dp[j] to dp[i] for some j < i, with a valid jump distance of k-1, k, or k+1. 
Let's define dp[i] = (exists j < i such that abs(stones[i] - stones[j]) in {k-1, k, k+1} and dp[j]). 
We iterate over the stones and update dp[i] for each stone. 
If dp[i-1] is True, then we can reach stone i if there exists a jump from stone j to stone i with valid distance. We check this condition for all j < i and update dp[i]. 
Finally, we return dp[-1], which indicates whether the frog can reach the last stone.
