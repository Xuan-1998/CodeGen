===BEGIN PLAN===
We can model each possible sequence of jumps as a separate subproblem. Can we find a way to combine these subproblems to form the solution?
The state expression could be defined as: dp[i] = True if the frog can reach stone i, False otherwise. The base case would be dp[0] = True since the frog starts on the first stone.
dp[i] is a boolean indicating whether the frog can reach the ith stone considering all possible jumps from the previous stones. 
The transition relationship is then dp[i] = any j such that |i-j| == k-1, k, or k+1 and dp[j] is True
Create a bottom-up dynamic programming table using a loop to fill in the dp array.
Fill in the base case dp[0] = True
For i from 1 to n-1:
    for j from max(0, i-k) to min(n-1, i+k):
        if |i-j| == k-1 or |i-j| == k or |i-j| == k+1 and dp[j]:
            dp[i] = True
return dp[n-1]
