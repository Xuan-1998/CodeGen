===BEGIN PLAN===
We can model each possible sequence of jumps as a separate subproblem. To combine these subproblems and form the solution, we can use dynamic programming.

The state expression could be defined as: dp[i] = True if the frog can reach stone i, False otherwise. The base case would be dp[0] = True since the frog starts on the first stone.

dp[i] is a boolean indicating whether the frog can reach the ith stone considering all possible jumps from the previous stones. The transition relationship is then:

dp[i] = any 0 <= j < i such that |i-j| == k-1, k, or k+1 and dp[j] is True

We will iterate through the stones in reverse order (from the last stone to the first) and for each stone, check if there is a valid sequence of jumps from previous stones. If we find one, return True; otherwise, continue with the next stone.

If we reach the first stone without finding a valid sequence, return False, indicating that the frog cannot cross the river.

This plan takes into account edge cases by handling the base case correctly and iterating through the stones in reverse order.
