===BEGIN PLAN===
The state of the frog is defined by its current position and previous jump length.
dp[i][j] = True if i==0 or (dp[i-1][k] where k in [j-1, j, j+1])
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][l] for any l in [j-k for k in [j-1, j, j+1]] and abs(stones[i] - stones[l]) in [k-1, k, k+1]
To implement a 2D array to store dp values with indices [i, j] where i is the stone index and j is the previous jump length.
