===BEGIN PLAN===
Can we break down the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved independently, but share some common information? If yes, dynamic programming with top-down approach using memoization might be suitable.

The state is the current stone index i and the maximum distance d such that the frog has not jumped beyond this distance. The base case remains the same: when i is equal to the number of stones - 1, indicating that the frog has reached the end of the river.

Use memoization dictionary with dynamic programming states stored in it.

For each stone index i and distance d, calculate whether the frog can reach the next stone at index i + 1 or more by jumping from the current stone. If possible, update the maximum distance d accordingly.

The final answer is True if the frog can reach the last stone, False otherwise.
