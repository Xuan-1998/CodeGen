===BEGIN PLAN===
Difference of Two Sequences: Identify the longest increasing subsequence's differences from an optimal solution.
State expression: The length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position.

1. Initialize a dynamic programming table dp of size n+1, where n is the array length, with all values set to 1 (base case for single-element subsequences).

2. Iterate through the array, and for each element i:
   - Find the maximum value in the previous elements that are less than or equal to element i.
   - Update dp[i] as the maximum of its current value and the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at this element plus 1.

3. The final result is the maximum value in the dp array, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

4. To avoid redundant computations, memoize the dynamic programming table by storing previously computed values.

5. As a bonus step, optimize the solution to run in O(n log n) time complexity using a more advanced data structure, such as a balanced binary search tree or a heap.
