===BEGIN PLAN===
DP array initialization: Initialize an array dp where each element dp[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i
For each element in the array:
    Compare with previous elements, if the current element is greater than or equal to the previous one, it's part of the same increasing sequence, update dp[i] accordingly
    If not, start a new sequence and update dp[i] with 1 (or 0 if there are no sequences ending at that index)
Find the maximum value in dp array: This represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence
===END PLAN===
