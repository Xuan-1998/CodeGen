===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i][j] is defined as the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at i, considering the last increase happened j steps ago.

Base case: dp[0][j] = 1 for all j (the first element is always part of an increasing sequence)

For each i from 1 to n:
    For each j from 0 to k:
        If a[i] > a[i - j], then the last increase happened j steps ago
            Update dp[i][j] to be 1 + dp[i - j][k - j]
        Else (no increase), then the last increase happened k steps ago
            Update dp[i][k] = max(dp[i][k], dp[i - 1][k])
