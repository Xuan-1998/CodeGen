===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming Plan:
Initialize an array dp of size n+1 with all elements set to 0.

For each element arr[i] in the input array:

    For j from i-1 down to 0:
        If arr[j] < arr[i], then update dp[i] as follows:
            If dp[i] is 0, then set it to 1
            Else, update dp[i] as max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

    Set the maximum value of dp from index 0 to n-1 as the length of the longest increasing subsequence

The state represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at a given index.
The transition depends on comparing the current element with previous elements in the array.
