===BEGIN PLAN===
DP Array: Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i with the last increase happening j steps ago.
Initialization: Initialize dp[0][j] = 1 for all j, since the longest increasing subsequence ending at index 0 is always 1.
Dynamic Programming: For each i from 1 to n-1 and each j from 0 to i:
    - If there exists k such that dp[k][j-1] + 1 > dp[i][j]:
        dp[i][j] = dp[k][j-1] + 1
    - Otherwise:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1])
Return: Return the maximum value in the last row of dp, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
