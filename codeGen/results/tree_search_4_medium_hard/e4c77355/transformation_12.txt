===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming: Define a recursive relation between subproblems, then use memoization to store computed results.

The length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i in the array is the maximum length of:
	- The longest increasing subsequence ending at any previous index j where arr[i] > arr[j]
	- 1 (since we can always include the current element)

Use a nested loop structure to tabulate the dynamic programming state transition:

let dp = new Array(arr.length).fill(1);

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
        if (arr[i] > arr[j]) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
        }
    }
}

Return the maximum value in the dp array.
