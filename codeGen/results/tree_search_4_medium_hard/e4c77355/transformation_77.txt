===BEGIN PLAN===
Let's analyze and improve the plan:

1. Identify the longest increasing subsequence's differences from an optimal solution:
   This step is unclear, as the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention anything about finding differences between sequences. Let's focus on identifying the longest increasing subsequence itself.

2. Base case: If the array is empty, return 0.
   Correct! The base case for a dynamic programming problem is usually when the input size becomes zero or invalid.

3. Consider a state representing the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position:
   This step is correct! We'll need to keep track of the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position in our array.

4. Use dynamic programming with tabulation and store states in a 2D table:
   Correct again! Using dynamic programming with tabulation (i.e., bottom-up approach) will help us efficiently solve this problem by storing previously computed states in a 2D table.

Updated Plan:

===BEGIN PLAN===
1. Base case: If the array is empty, return 0.
2. Initialize a 2D table dp of size n x m, where n is the length of the input array and m is a constant (e.g., 10000). Fill all elements in dp with -1.
3. Iterate through each element in the input array.
4. For each element at index i:
   a. Calculate the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at that position by comparing it to all previous elements and updating dp[i][j] accordingly.
   b. Store this updated state in dp[i][j].
5. Return the maximum value from dp[n-1][m-1].
