===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.

DP[i][j] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i with the last element being j.
Update DP[i][j] based on the maximum value from previous states and current state, where:
  - If there is no increasing subsequence ending at i with last element j, then it remains as previously calculated (DP[i-1][j-1]).
  - If there is an increasing subsequence ending at i with last element j, then update DP[i][j] to be the maximum length of such subsequences.

Use dynamic programming with memoization by using a top-down approach, where you start with the base case and build up the solution.
Calculate the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index in the array, storing this value in DP[i][i].
For each index i and each element j in the array:
  - If j is greater than all elements in the array before i, then the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at i with last element being j is 1.
  - Otherwise, update DP[i][j] based on the maximum value from previous states and current state.

Calculate the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequences for each index in the array by iterating through the array one more time:
  - The length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at any given index is the maximum length calculated for that index.
