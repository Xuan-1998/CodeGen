===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming: Define a recursive relation between subproblems, then use memoization to store computed results.

The length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i in the array is the maximum length of any increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index i, plus one. This can be expressed as:

dp[i] = max(dp[j] + 1 for j from 0 to i-1 if arr[i] > arr[j])

The initial condition is dp[0] = 1, since an empty subsequence has length 1.

Use dynamic programming to compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence by considering each element in the array.

DP solutions can be implemented using a 1D table where the state is i and the value is dp[i] representing the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.
