===BEGIN PLAN===
DP Solution:
1. Initialize a table dp with size (n+1), where n is the length of the array, and fill it with zeros.
2. Iterate through the array from left to right, considering each element as the end of an increasing subsequence.
3. For each element, calculate the maximum value seen so far in an increasing sequence by iterating over the table:
   - If the current element is greater than the previous maximum, update the maximum with the current element's value.
4. Update dp[i] to be the maximum length of the increasing subsequence ending at index i.
5. Return the maximum length found in the dp array.
