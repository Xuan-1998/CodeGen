===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming Solution:
1. Create a dynamic programming table dp of size n+1 with all elements initialized to 0, where n is the length of the input array.
2. Iterate over each element in the array from left to right, and for each element at index i:
   a. Initialize a variable lis[i] to represent the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at this position.
   b. For each previous element j < i where the difference between the current element and j is not greater than 1:
      i. Update lis[i] to be the maximum of its current value and dp[j] + 1 (since we can extend the increasing subsequence).
3. The length of the longest increasing subsequence is then equal to max(dp), where dp represents the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences ending at each position.
4. Memoization: Utilize a dictionary memo to store previously computed values for faster lookups, as described in the original plan.
