===BEGIN PLAN===
Difference of Two Sequences: Identify the longest increasing subsequence's differences from an optimal solution.

Base case: If the array is empty, return 0; otherwise, initialize dp array with ones.

State transition relationship: For each element at position i, find the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at previous positions and consider the current element as part of the sequence or not. 

Tabulation-based solution where you fill up the dynamic programming table row by row, considering each element's options to either extend the current increasing subsequence or start a new one.

Update dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], 1) if the current element is larger than the previous one; otherwise, reset dp[i] to 0. If the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at position i is greater than the maximum length found so far, update this value accordingly.

Finally, return the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence.
