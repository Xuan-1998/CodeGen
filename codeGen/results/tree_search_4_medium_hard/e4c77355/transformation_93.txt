Dynamic Programming Approach:
Let dp[i] be the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.

1. Initialize dp: Set dp[0] = 1 (since the longest increasing subsequence ending at the first element is just the first element itself)
2. Iterate through the array:
   For each element x at index i:
      Find the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with elements less than or equal to x:
         Compare dp[j] for all j < i and x > arr[j]
         Update dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
3. The final answer is the maximum value in the dp array
