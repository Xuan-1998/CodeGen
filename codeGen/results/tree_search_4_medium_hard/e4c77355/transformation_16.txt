===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming:
  Define a recursive relation between subproblems,
  then use memoization to store computed results.

The length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i in the array
  is the maximum length of any increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index i
  plus one, if the current element is greater than the previous elements.

Consider using a 1D array (not 2D) to store intermediate results,
  where dp[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.
Store previously computed values for subproblems in a dictionary and reuse them when possible.

Start with a base case: if the input array is empty, return 0.
Then, iterate through the array from left to right:
  For each element at index i,
    consider the maximum length of any increasing subsequence that ends with this element
    by comparing it with all previous elements and taking the maximum.
  Update the dictionary with the computed value.

Finally, return the last element in the dictionary as the result.
