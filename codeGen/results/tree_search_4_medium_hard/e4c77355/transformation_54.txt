===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.

Let DP[i] represent the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i, considering all previous elements.

Transition relationship:
- If the current element is greater than the previous one, update DP[i] to be 1 plus the maximum length of increasing subsequences that end before this element.
- Otherwise, keep the same value.

The updated plan looks good. It uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.
