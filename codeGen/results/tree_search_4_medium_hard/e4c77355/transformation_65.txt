===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.

State S[i] is a set representing the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.
Represent the state S[i] as the maximum length of increasing subsequences that end at index i, considering all possible predecessors.

Use a dynamic programming table to store the lengths of longest increasing subsequences ending at each index.

Initialise the DP table with zeros: dp = [0] * len(arr)

For each element arr[i]:
    For each previous element j < i:
        If arr[j] < arr[i]: 
            Update dp[i] as max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

Return the maximum length in the DP table.
