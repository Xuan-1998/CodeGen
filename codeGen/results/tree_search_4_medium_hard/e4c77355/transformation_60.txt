===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.

State S[i] is a set representing the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.

Choose dynamic programming states where each state represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position in the array.

Maintain a 1D array dp[] where each element at index i represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at that position.

dp[i] = 1 if arr[i] is the first element of an increasing subsequence, otherwise:

For j from 0 to i-1:
    If arr[j] < arr[i] and S[j] + 1 > dp[i]:
        Update dp[i] as S[j] + 1

Return max(dp)
