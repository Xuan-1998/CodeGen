===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming: Define a recursive relation between subproblems, then use memoization to store computed results.

The length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i in the array
Consider using a 1D array (not 2D) to store intermediate results, indexed by value.
Initialize an empty dictionary dp and set it as the memoization storage.

Define a recursive relation: For each index i, consider the maximum increasing subsequence ending at i-1. If the element at i is greater than the last element of this subsequence, then the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at i is one more than the length of the subsequence ending at i-1.

The recursive relation can be formalized as follows:
dp[i] = max(dp[j] + 1 for j in range(i) if arr[i] > arr[j]) where arr is the input array

Use memoization to store computed results and avoid redundant computation. Check if dp[i] is already calculated before performing the recursive computation.
