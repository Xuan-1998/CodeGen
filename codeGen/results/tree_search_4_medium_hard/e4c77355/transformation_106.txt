===BEGIN PLAN===
Let L[i] be the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at position i.

1. State expression: L[i] = max(L[j]) + 1, where j is the last element that precedes i and has an increase of more than or equal to i - j.

2. Tabulation using a 1D array: Initialize L[0] = 1 (base case). For each position i > 0:
   a. Iterate through all previous positions j < i.
   b. Check if the element at position j is smaller than the element at position i, meaning it can be considered as part of the increasing subsequence ending at position i.
   c. If true, update L[i] = max(L[i], L[j] + 1).

3. Return the maximum value in L[], which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
