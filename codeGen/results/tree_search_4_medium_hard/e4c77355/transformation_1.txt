===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming: Define a recursive relation between subproblems, then use memoization to store computed results.
The length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i in the array is equal to 1 plus the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequences ending at indices less than i, where the last element of the subsequence is smaller than the element at index i.

Define a function that takes an array and returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence
Dynamically construct the memoization table using a dictionary where keys are indices and values are the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences ending at those indices.
Sort the input array in ascending order to ensure the dynamic programming process is correct.
