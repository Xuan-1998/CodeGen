===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.

DP[i][j] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i with the last element being j.

DP[i-1] is updated based on the maximum value from previous states and current state, taking into account the maximum possible increase.

Use a top-down approach by initializing DP[i][j] to 0 for all i, j, then iteratively update the longest increasing subsequences at each index.

For each element in the array:
	- Iterate through previous elements to find the maximum length of increasing subsequence that ends with the current element.
	- Update the maximum length found and the last element of the longest increasing subsequence.
