===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming:
  Define a recursive relation between subproblems,
  then use memoization to store computed results.

Let dp[i] be the length of the longest increasing subsequence
ending at index i in the array.

Compute the maximum value from all subsequences as the final answer,
taking into account the current state of the dynamic programming transition:

dp[i] = max(dp[j]) + 1 for j in range(0, i) and A[i] > A[j]

Memoize the recursive function using a dictionary to store computed results:
memo = {}

Final Answer: Return max(dp)
