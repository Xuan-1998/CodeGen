===BEGIN PLAN===
Find Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):
  * Difference of Two Sequences: Identify the longest increasing subsequence's differences from an optimal solution.
  * Base case: If the array is empty, return 0; otherwise, consider only the first k elements.
  * The maximum value seen so far in an increasing sequence is a good starting point.
  * Utilize memoization by storing the results of subproblems and reusing them as needed.
    - Initialize a dynamic programming table (dp) with zeros.
    - For each element in the array:
      - Find the longest increasing subsequence ending at this element, considering only previous elements less than it.
      - Update dp[i] with the maximum length found so far.
  * Return the maximum value in dp as the length of the LIS.
