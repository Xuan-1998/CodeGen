===BEGIN PLAN===
Difference of Two Sequences: Identify the longest increasing subsequence's differences from an optimal solution.

Base case: If the array is empty (length 0), initialize the dp table with all values set to 1, as the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an empty array is 0.
Otherwise, iterate through the array. For each element at index i:
    Compare the current element with elements before it.
    If the current element is greater than the previous one, update the state by taking the maximum between the current state and 1 plus the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at the previous element.
    Otherwise (or if this is the first element), reset the state to 1.
Return the maximum value in the dp table as the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
