Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.

DP[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i, considering all previous elements. Initialize DP with zeros.

Dynamic Programming: Consider each element in the array as a potential starting point for an increasing subsequence.
Let DP[i] represent the length of the longest increasing subsequence starting at index i.

Transition relationship:
    1. If the current element is greater than the previous one, update DP[i] to be 1 plus the maximum length of increasing subsequences that start after this element (i.e., max(DP[j])) for all j > i.
    2. Otherwise, keep the same value.

Consider all previous elements to determine the maximum length of increasing subsequences ending at index i.
