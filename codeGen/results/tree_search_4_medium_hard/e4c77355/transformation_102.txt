===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming:
  Initialize an array dp where dp[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.
  Iterate through the array and for each element at index i:
    If the current element is smaller than or equal to the previous elements (i.e., no increase), reset the state by setting dp[i] = 1.
    Otherwise, update dp[i] as the maximum length of increasing subsequences ending at previous indices that are less than the current element plus one.
  Utilize memoization by storing previously computed values in dp to avoid redundant calculations and improve performance.

Base Case:
  If the array is empty (i.e., length 0), return 0.
  If the array has only one element, return 1.

Memoization:
  Store previously computed values in dp to avoid redundant calculations and improve performance. This can be done by using a dictionary where keys are indices and values are the lengths of longest increasing subsequences ending at those indices.

Edge Cases:
  Handle edge cases such as empty arrays or arrays with only one element.
