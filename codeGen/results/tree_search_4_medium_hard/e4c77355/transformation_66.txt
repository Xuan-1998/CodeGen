===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.

State S[i] is a set representing the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.
Represent the state S[i] as the maximum length of increasing subsequences that end at index i, considering all possible predecessors.

1. Initialize an array dp of size n+1 with all elements set to 1, where n is the size of the input array.
2. Iterate through the array from left to right:
    a. For each element at index i:
        i. Find the maximum length of increasing subsequences that end at indices j < i such that arr[j] < arr[i].
        ii. Update dp[i] with the maximum value found in step (a)(i).
3. The answer is the maximum value in the array dp.
