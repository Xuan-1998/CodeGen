===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming: Define a recursive relation between subproblems, then use memoization to store computed results.

Let dp[i] be the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i in the array.

For each element x at index i:

1. If the current element is greater than any previous element, it can be appended to an existing increasing subsequence.
    - In this case, dp[i] = 1 + max(dp[j]) for j < i and A[j] < A[i].
2. Otherwise, consider all previous elements that are smaller than x. The longest increasing subsequence ending at index i is either the same as one of these subsequences or one element longer.
    - In this case, dp[i] = 1 + max(dp[j]) for j < i and A[j] < A[i].

Use a bottom-up approach with a tabulated array to fill up the solution.

Fill in the dp table column by column from left to right. For each cell, compute the value based on its dependencies.
Read off the answer as the maximum value in the last row of the dp table.
