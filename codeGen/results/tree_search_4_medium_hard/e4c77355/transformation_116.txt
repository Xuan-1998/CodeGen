===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming: Identify the longest increasing subsequence's differences from an optimal solution.

State expression: The length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position considering the last increase happened k steps ago.

Implement a 2D array to store the lengths of longest increasing subsequences, where each cell represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at that position considering the last increase happened k steps ago. Initialize the first row as 1 (single element) and all subsequent rows by comparing the current element with elements in previous rows.

Consider sorting the input array for more efficient lookup.

Edge case: Handle the edge case where the input array is empty or has only one element.
