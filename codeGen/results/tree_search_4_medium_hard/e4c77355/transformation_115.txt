===BEGIN PLAN===
State expression: Let dp[i] be the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at position i.

Top-down recursive function:
- For each position i in the array, calculate the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending there. 
  - This is done by considering all previous positions j where arr[j] < arr[i]. 
  - The length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at i is then the maximum of this plus one (for the new element) and dp[j].
- Use memoization to store intermediate results in a table dp[].

Base case: If the array contains only one unique integer, its length is 1.

State transition:
- For each position i, update dp[i] as the maximum over all previous positions j where arr[j] < arr[i], plus one for the new element.
- Update memoization table dp[].

Main function:
- Initialize a table dp[] of size n+1 with -âˆž (or some large negative number).
- Fill the dp[] table using top-down recursive function with memoization.
- Return dp[n].

Edge cases: 
- If array is empty, return 0.
- If array contains only one unique integer, return 1.
