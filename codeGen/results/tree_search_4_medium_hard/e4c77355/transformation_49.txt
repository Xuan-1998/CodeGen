Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.

DP[i][j] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i with the last element being j. The transition relationship is to update DP[i] by considering all previous elements (up to i), finding the maximum increase, and adding 1.

Utilize a combination of tabulation and memoization to achieve the O(n^2) time complexity while minimizing redundant calculations.

For edge cases, consider initializing DP with zeros or negatives infinity for indices out of range.
