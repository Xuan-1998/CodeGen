===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming: Define a recursive relation between subproblems, then use memoization to store computed results.

Define a 2D table dp[i][j] where i is the index and j is the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at that position. Initialize it with all values being 1 because the shortest possible increasing subsequence is always one element long.

For each index i, iterate over all elements less than or equal to arr[i]. For each such element x, update dp[i][j] if j+1 is greater than dp[k][j-1] where k is the index of x. This ensures that we consider all possible increasing subsequences ending at position i.

Use memoization to store computed results in the table and avoid redundant computation.

Finally, return the maximum value in the last column of the table which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
