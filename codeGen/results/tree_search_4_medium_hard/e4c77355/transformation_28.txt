===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming: Define a recursive relation between subproblems, then use memoization to store computed results.

The number of elements less than x in the array up to index i is calculated as follows:

- Initialize dp[i] = 1 (the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i has length 1)
- For each previous element j < i:
    - If arr[j] < arr[i], update dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1) (consider the possibility of extending the longest increasing subsequence ending at j)

Develop an iterative dynamic programming algorithm by initializing a table with the first element and iteratively updating the table based on previously computed values.
