===BEGIN PLAN===
Create a dynamic programming table dp of size n (where n is the length of the input array) initialized with zeros. The state dp[i] will represent the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.

For each element arr[i] in the array:

1.  Initialize a variable max_length to 0.
2.  Iterate over all previous elements arr[j] (j < i):
    *   If arr[i] > arr[j], it means we can extend the increasing subsequence by one more element:
        +   Update max_length with the maximum between its current value and dp[j] + 1.
3.  Set dp[i] to max_length.

Finally, return the maximum value in the dp table (i.e., the length of the longest increasing subsequence).

===END PLAN===
