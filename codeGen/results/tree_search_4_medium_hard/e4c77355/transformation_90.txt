===BEGIN PLAN===
Let dp[i] denote the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.

1. Initialize dp with zeros: dp[0] = 0 for all indices i in the array.
2. For each element a_i in the array, from left to right:
    - Iterate through all previous elements (from j = 0 to j < i):
        * If a_j < a_i, then update dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1).
        * This ensures that we consider all possible increasing subsequences ending at index i.
3. Finally, return the maximum value in dp: return max(dp).
