===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.
State S[i] is a set representing the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.
Represent the state S[i] as the maximum length of increasing subsequenses that end at index i, considering all possible predecessors.
Use dynamic programming to fill up the states. Start by initializing S[0] = 1 (since the longest increasing subsequence ending at index 0 is always of length 1).
Then iterate through the array from left to right:
For each element arr[i], update S[i] as follows:
- If arr[i] is less than the previous element, just copy the state from the previous element.
- Else, consider all possible predecessors and take the maximum one. This corresponds to the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends at index i.
Finally, return the maximum value in the S array as the answer.
