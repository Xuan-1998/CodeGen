Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.

DP := zeros(len(arr))
For i from 0 to len(arr) - 1:
    If i == 0:
        DP[i] := 1
    Else:
        For j from 0 to i - 1:
            If arr[i] > arr[j]:
                DP[i] = max(DP[i], 1 + DP[j])
    Return max(DP)
