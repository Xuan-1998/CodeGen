===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.
DP[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i, considering all previous elements.

Dynamic Programming:
  For each element in the array (i):
    For each previous element j < i:
      If arr[j] < arr[i]:
        Update DP[i] to be the maximum between its current value and DP[j] + 1
      Else:
        Keep the same value
