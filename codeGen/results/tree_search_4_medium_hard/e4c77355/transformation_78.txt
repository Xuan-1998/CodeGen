===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming with Memoization:
Base case: If the array is empty, return 0.

Consider a state representing the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position.
Create an array dp where dp[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.
Initialize dp[0] to 1 (since a single element is considered an increasing subsequence).

Iterate through the array:
For each element x at index i, consider all previous elements y such that y < x.
Update dp[i] to be the maximum of its current value and 1 plus the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at the previous position j where y <= arr[j].

Apply memoization to cache intermediate results: Use a dictionary memo to store the computed lengths.

Return dp[-1] as the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the input array.
