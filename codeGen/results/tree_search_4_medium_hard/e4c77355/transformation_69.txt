===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming:
State Expression: The length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position.
Bottom-Up Approach:
1. Initialize an array dp where dp[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.
2. Iterate through the input array and for each element, consider all previous elements that are less than this element.
3. For each such element, update dp[i] to be the maximum of its current value and 1 + dp[j] where j is the index of the previous element.
4. The final answer will be the maximum value in the dp array.
