===BEGIN PLAN===
Difference of Two Sequences: Identify the longest increasing subsequence's differences from an optimal solution.

Base case: If the array is empty, return 0; otherwise, consider only the first k elements.

DP array initialization: Create a dynamic programming (DP) array dp of size n+1, where n is the length of the input array. Initialize all values in dp to 1, since the longest increasing subsequence for any single element is itself with a length of 1.

 Iterate over the input array:

    For each element x at index i:
        Find the maximum value seen so far (max_seen) that is less than or equal to x.
        Update max_seen accordingly. If no such value exists, set it to -âˆž.
        Calculate the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at x as dp[i] = 1 + max(dp[j]) where j < i and arr[j] < x.
        Update dp[i] with this calculated length.

Return the maximum value in the DP array (not necessarily the last one) as the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
