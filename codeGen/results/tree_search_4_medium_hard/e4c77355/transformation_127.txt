Dynamic Programming Solution:
1. Create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] will store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i considering previous elements up to j.
2. Initialize dp[0][i] = 1 for all i, since the longest increasing subsequence ending at the first element is always of length 1.
3. Iterate over the array and for each element at index i:
   a. Iterate from j=0 to i-1 and consider previous elements up to j.
   b. If the current element is greater than the element at index j, update dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j-1] + 1).
4. Return the maximum value in the last row of dp, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
