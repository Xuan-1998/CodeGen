Dynamic Programming Solution:
Let dp[i][j] be the maximum length of a monotonic sequence that ends at index i and has the last element j.

The base case is when there are no elements in the sequence, so dp[0][0] = 1. For any other cell, consider two cases: either the current element is part of the sequence or not.
Case 1: The current element is part of the sequence
In this case, we can extend the current subsequence by one if the next element is greater than the current element.
dp[i][j] = 1 + max(dp[0..i-1][k]) where k < j and arr[k] <= arr[j]

Case 2: The current element is not part of the sequence
In this case, we cannot extend any subsequence from previous elements, so dp[i][j] remains the same as dp[i-1][j]
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]

The overall solution can be written as:
dp[i][j] = max(1 + max(dp[0..i-1][k]) where k < j and arr[k] <= arr[j], dp[i-1][j])

To fill up the dp table, iterate over all elements in the sequence. For each element, calculate dp[i][j] for all possible values of j.

Finally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence is stored at dp[n-1][m-1]
