===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.
DP[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position i.

Initialize DP: Set DP[0] = 1, since an empty sequence is considered an increasing subsequence with a length of 1. For all other positions i, set DP[i] = 1.

For each element a[j] in the array:
    Update DP[i][j] as follows:
        If a[j] > a[j-1], then update DP[i][j] to be 1 + max(DP[k][j-1] for k in range(i)). This means we are considering all possible increasing subsequences ending at index i and the last element being j.
        Else, set DP[i][j] = 0.

Return DP[n-1], where n is the length of the array. This represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
