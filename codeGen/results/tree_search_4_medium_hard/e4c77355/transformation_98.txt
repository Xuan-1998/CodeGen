===BEGIN PLAN===
Difference of Two Sequences: Identify the longest increasing subsequence's differences from an optimal solution.
Base case: If the array is empty (i.e., the current position is the first element), reset the state. 
The state transition relationship could be based on finding the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position and considering the current element as part of the sequence or not.

Dynamic programming with bottom-up approach using a 2D table to store the lengths of longest increasing subsequences ending at each position:
	* Initialize a 2D table, dp, where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index j in the first i elements.
	* Fill up the table by iterating over the array. For each element, consider whether it should be included in the longest increasing subsequence or not.
	* The state transition could be: 
		if (element > previous_element):
			dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][k] where k is the position of the previous element that is smaller than the current one, if such a previous element exists; otherwise, dp[i][j] = 1.
		else:
			dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]

The plan can be improved by considering edge cases: 
	* If the array contains duplicate elements, handle this situation correctly. For example, consider whether a sequence that includes duplicates should still be counted as increasing.

This plan seems to cover most of the necessary steps for solving the problem. However, some parts might need further clarification or refinement.
