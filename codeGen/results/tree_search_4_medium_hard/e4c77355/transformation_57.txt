Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.

DP[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i, considering all previous elements.

Dynamic Programming: Consider each element in the array as a potential starting point for an increasing subsequence. Let DP[i] represent the length of the longest increasing subsequence starting at index i.

Transition relationship:
    If the current element is greater than the previous one, update DP[i] to be 1 plus the maximum length of increasing subsequences that start after this element.
    Otherwise, keep the same value.
Determine the maximum length of increasing subsequences that start after this element and update DP[i] accordingly.

To find the overall longest increasing subsequence, iterate through DP[] and return the maximum value.
