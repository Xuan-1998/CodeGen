===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming:
    1. State Expression: Let dp[i] be the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.
    2. Difference of Two Sequences: Identify the longest increasing subsequence's differences from an optimal solution.
        For each position, find the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence considering the last increase happened k steps ago.
    3. Memoization:
        Store the lengths of subsequences in a dictionary and reuse previously computed values.
    4. Implementation:
        Initialize dp with zeros.
        Iterate through the array:
            For each element, find the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence considering the last increase happened k steps ago.
            Update dp[i] with this value.
        Return the maximum value in dp.
