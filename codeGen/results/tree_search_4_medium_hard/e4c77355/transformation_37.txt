===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming:
  Define a recursive relation between subproblems,
  then use memoization to store computed results.

The maximum value seen so far in the array up to index i
  Think about the last element added to each increasing subsequence,
  and how it affects the lengths of subsequences that come before it.
Create a memoization dictionary where keys are tuples representing indices
  and values are the longest increasing subsequences ending at those indices.

Let's consider the recursive relation: for any i, let L[i] be the length of the
longest increasing subsequence ending at index i. Then, we have:

L[i] = 1 if A[i] is the maximum value seen so far,
= max(L[j]) + 1 for all j < i and A[j] < A[i]

Memoization dictionary: store L[i] for each i

This approach can be improved by using a bottom-up dynamic programming
approach, instead of top-down recursive relation.

Potential issues with the plan:
- Edge cases: what happens when the array is empty or has only one element?
  Handle these cases separately.
- Optimization: how to efficiently store and look up memoized values?
