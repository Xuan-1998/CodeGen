Dynamic Programming Approach:
    1. Initialize a 1D array dp of size n + 1, where n is the length of the input array, and set all values to 0.
    2. Iterate through the input array from left to right, considering each element as the end of a potential increasing subsequence.
        - For each element, find the maximum length of increasing subsequence ending at that position by comparing it with all previous elements.
            * If an element is greater than its predecessor, then the length of the increasing subsequence increases by 1.
            * Otherwise, consider the longest increasing subsequence ending at the previous element and increment its length by 1.
        - Update dp[i] with the maximum value found in step 2.1 for each i from 0 to n-1.
    3. Return the maximum value in dp[], which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
