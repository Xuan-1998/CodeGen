===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.

State S[i] is a set representing the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.

Choose dynamic programming states where each state represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position in the array.

Use a 1D array dp to store the lengths of longest increasing subsequences, and fill it up iteratively.
Initialize dp[0] = 1 (since a single element is considered an increasing subsequence of length 1).

For each i from 1 to n-1:
    For each j from 0 to i:
        If arr[j] < arr[i], update dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

Return the maximum value in dp as the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
