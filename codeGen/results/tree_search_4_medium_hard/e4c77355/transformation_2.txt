===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming: Define a recursive relation between subproblems, then use memoization to store computed results.

The length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i in the array
Define a function that takes an array and returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence

Use dynamic programming to solve this problem by defining dp[i] as 1 plus the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at any index j less than i, such that arr[j] < arr[i].

However, there's a missing piece in the plan. We need to handle the base case, which is when i is the first element in the array. In this case, dp[i] should be 1, because the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i is just the single element itself.

To improve the plan, we can initialize the dynamic programming array with a value that represents the base case. This way, we ensure that the function works correctly for all indices in the array, not just for the first one.

Potential issues with the plan include:

- Handling edge cases: The plan assumes that the input array is non-empty and contains only integers. We should add checks to handle these edge cases.
- Memoization: Although the plan mentions memoization, it doesn't specify how we will store and retrieve the computed values. We can use a dictionary or an array to store the dynamic programming values.

Here's the updated version of the plan:
