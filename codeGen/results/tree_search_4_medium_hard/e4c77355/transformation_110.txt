===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming Solution:
Create a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i and with the last increase happening j positions ago.

Initialize the dp table with zeros, assuming no increases have occurred yet.
Iterate over the array elements.
For each element x at index i:
    For each possible previous increase j from 1 to i:
        If x is greater than or equal to the previous element (j-1), update dp[i][j] as follows:
            If there was an increase j positions ago, then consider it and add 1 to the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index j.
            Else, start a new sequence with length 1.

To find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS), iterate over the dp table's last row [i][j] for i from 0 to n-1. The maximum value represents the LIS.
