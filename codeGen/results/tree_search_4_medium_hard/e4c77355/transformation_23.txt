===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming:
Define a recursive relation between subproblems, then use memoization to store computed results.
The number of elements less than x in the array up to index i
Consider the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position, and how this relates to the longest increasing subsequences ending at previous positions.
To implement a bottom-up dynamic programming approach by creating a 2D table where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i and with the last element being j.

1. Initialize a 2D table dp of size n x m, where n is the length of the array and m is the maximum value in the array.
2. Fill the first row of the dp table, setting each cell to 1 since a single-element subsequence has a length of 1.
3. For each element in the input array:
    - Iterate through the previous elements in the array that are less than or equal to the current element.
    - For each such previous element, find its longest increasing subsequence ending at that position.
    - Update the dp table for the current element by taking the maximum of its current value and 1 plus the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at the previous element.
4. Return the maximum value in the last row of the dp table as the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
