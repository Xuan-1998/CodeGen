===BEGIN PLAN===
Let d[i] be the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.

1. Initialize an array d with size n+1 where n is the length of the input array, and set all values to 0 or -1 (to indicate no increasing subsequence).
2. For each element a_i in the array:
   - Iterate over previous elements a_j where j < i.
   - If a_i > a_j, then update d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
3. The length of the longest increasing subsequence is equal to max(d).
