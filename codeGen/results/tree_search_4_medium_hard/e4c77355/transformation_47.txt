===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.

DP[i][j] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i with the last element being j. Initialize DP with size n+1, where n is the length of the input array.

Transition relationship: For each index i in the array:
  - Iterate through all previous elements (up to i) and find the maximum increase (i.e., the maximum value of j such that arr[j] > arr[i])
  - Update DP[i] by considering all possible increases up to i, and add 1 to the length
  - Initialize the first element in DP as 1 (since there's only one way to make an increasing subsequence with one element)

Return the maximum value in the last row of DP
