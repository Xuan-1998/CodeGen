===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming Plan for Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):

1. Create a table dp of size n, where n is the length of the input array. Each cell dp[i] will store the maximum length of an increasing subsequence that ends with the ith element.

2. Initialize dp[0] = 1, since the longest increasing subsequence ending at the first element is just that one element itself.

3. For each element i from 1 to n-1:
   a. Iterate over all previous elements j such that a[i] > a[j].
   b. Update dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1) if this new subsequence is longer than the current longest increasing subsequence ending at ith.

4. The final answer will be the maximum value in the dp table, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
