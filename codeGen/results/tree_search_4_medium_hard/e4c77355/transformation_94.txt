Dynamic Programming Approach:
1. Initialize a table dp with zeros, where dp[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at element i in the input array.
2. Iterate through the input array and for each element i:
    - Compare it to all previous elements j (j < i) and find the maximum length of the increasing subsequence that ends at j and is less than i.
    - Update dp[i] with the maximum value found plus one, since we're considering the current element as the next in the increasing sequence.
3. Return the maximum value in the table dp, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the input array.
