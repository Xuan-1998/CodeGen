===BEGIN PLAN===
dp[i] = max(dp[j]) where j < i and nums[i] > nums[j]
Initialize dp array with all values set to 1 (since the longest increasing subsequence ending at any index is initially a single element)

For each element in the input array:
    Update dp[i] by considering the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence that ended at previous indices j where nums[i] > nums[j]
    If there's no such j, set dp[i] = 1 (since it's still just a single element)
Return max(dp) as the length of the longest increasing subsequence
