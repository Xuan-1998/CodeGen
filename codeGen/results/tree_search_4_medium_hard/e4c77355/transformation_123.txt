Dynamic Programming Approach: Identify the longest increasing subsequence's length for each prefix.

Base case:
	+ If the array is empty, return 0
	+ Initialize dp (dynamic programming) table with zeros
	+ Iterate through the array, considering each element as a starting point for an increasing subsequence

Recursive Case:
	+ For each element in the array:
		- Calculate the maximum length of increasing subsequence ending at this element (using previously computed values)
		- Update dp[i] (length of longest increasing subsequence ending at i) with the maximum value
	+ Return the maximum value in dp[] (length of longest increasing subsequence)

Store Results:
	+ Use a table to store the results for each prefix, avoiding redundant computations
