===BEGIN PLAN===
Find all increasing subsequences by maintaining dynamic programming state variables for each position in the array:
  dp[i]: longest increasing subsequence ending at i
State expression: max(dp[j] + 1) for j < i and A[i] > A[j]
Employ memoization using a dictionary to store previously computed values and avoid redundant calculations.
