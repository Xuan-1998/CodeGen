Tabulation:
Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.

DP[i][j] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i with the last element being j.
DP[i] is a list that keeps track of the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position i, so DP[i][j] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i with the last element being j.

For each element in the array:
- Iterate through previous elements to find the maximum length of increasing subsequences.
- If an increasing subsequence is found, update DP[i] accordingly.
- The final answer would be the maximum length of all DP[i].

This plan seems correct and can solve the problem efficiently. However, it's missing edge cases, such as what if there are no increasing subsequences? What if the array is empty?
