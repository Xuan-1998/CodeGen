===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming:
    Initialize an array dp with the same length as the input array.
    Set dp[0] = 1 (the longest increasing subsequence up to index 0 is always 1).
    For each element at index i in the array, do the following:
        Initialize maxLength = 0
        For each previous index j such that array[j] < array[i]:
            If dp[j] + 1 > maxLength:
                maxLength = dp[j] + 1
        Set dp[i] = maxLength
    Return dp[-1] (the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the entire array)
