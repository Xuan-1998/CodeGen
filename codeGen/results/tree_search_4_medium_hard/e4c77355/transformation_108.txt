===BEGIN PLAN===
Memoized Dynamic Programming:
State expression: The length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position considering the last increase happened k steps ago.
Use memoization to store the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences that end at each position, and update these values as you iterate through the array.

1. Initialize a memoization table dp of size n (where n is the length of the input array) with all elements initialized to 1, because the smallest possible increasing subsequence ending at each position is of length 1.
2. Iterate through the array from left to right:
    - For each element i in the array, iterate through the previous elements j up to i-1 (inclusive):
        * If arr[i] > arr[j], update dp[i] to be the maximum of its current value and dp[j] + 1.
3. The length of the longest increasing subsequence is stored in dp[n-1].
