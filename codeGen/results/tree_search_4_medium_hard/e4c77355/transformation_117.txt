===BEGIN PLAN===
Difference of Two Sequences: Identify the longest increasing subsequence's differences from an optimal solution.

State expression: The length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position considering the last increase happened k steps ago.

Dynamic Programming with Memoization:
- Initialize a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i and considering the last increase happened j steps ago.
- Iterate through the input array, for each element:
    - If it's the first element or the current element is greater than the previous one, update dp[i][0] to be the maximum of its current value and 1 (for a new increasing subsequence starting at this position).
    - For k from 1 to the length of the array minus i, if the current element is greater than the element at index i-k, update dp[i][k] to be the maximum of its current value and dp[i-k][k-1] + 1 (considering the last increase happened k steps ago).
- Return the maximum value in the last row of dp as the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
