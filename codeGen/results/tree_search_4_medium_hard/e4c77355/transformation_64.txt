===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.

State S[i] is a set representing the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.

Define a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array, updating longest increasing subsequences as you go, and using previous states to compute current ones.

Create a 1D array dp where dp[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.

For each element in the array, iterate from left to right. For each iteration:

* Initialize dp[i] to 1 (base case: a single-element sequence is always increasing).
* Iterate through all previous elements j < i.
* If the current element is greater than the previous element and not previously included in any increasing subsequence, increment dp[i].
* Update S[i] with the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequences ending at each of the previous elements j < i.

Return dp[n-1], where n is the length of the array, as the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
