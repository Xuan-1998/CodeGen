===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.

State S[i] is a set representing the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.

Choose dynamic programming states where each state represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position in the array.

Dynamic programming: 
- Initialize an array dp with size n+1, where n is the length of the input array. Each element dp[i] will store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.
- Iterate through the array from left to right:
  - For each element a_i in the array:
    - If S[i] is empty or the last element in S[i-1] is smaller than a_i, update S[i] with {a_i} (i.e., create a new subsequence).
    - Otherwise, merge S[i-1] and {a_i} to form a new subsequence.
  - Update dp[i] as the maximum of the current longest increasing subsequence ending at i and the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at i-1 plus one (because we can add a_i to the previous longest increasing subsequence).
- Return dp[n], which stores the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array.
