===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.

State S[i] is a set representing the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.

Define a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array, updating longest increasing subsequences as you go, and using previous states to compute current ones.

Use dynamic programming to build up a table of the longest increasing subsequences from left to right.

For each element in the array:
    Initialize S[i] with {i} (the subsequence ending at index i has only one element).
    For each previous element j such that arr[j] < arr[i]:
        Update S[i] by taking the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequences ending at indices j and i, adding 1 to it.
    
This approach guarantees O(n^2) time complexity. To improve it to O(n log n), we can use a more advanced data structure such as segment trees or binary indexed trees to store the lengths of longest increasing subsequences ending at each index.

The plan includes edge cases: it handles the case where there is only one element in the array by initializing S[i] with {i}. It also handles the case where all elements are the same by not updating S[i].
