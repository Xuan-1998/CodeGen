===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming: Define a recursive relation between subproblems, then use memoization to store computed results.

Let dp[i] be the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i in the array. We can define the following recursive relation:

dp[i] = max(dp[j]) + 1, where j < i and arr[i] > arr[j]

This is because the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i must include the element at index i itself, and we need to find the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequences that end before index i and are strictly less than arr[i].

Use a nested loop structure to tabulate the dynamic programming state transition:
for i from 0 to n-1
    for j from 0 to i-1
        if arr[i] > arr[j]
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
