===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming:
    Define a recursive relation between subproblems
    Use memoization to store computed results

Let dp[i] be the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i in the array

    Initialize dp with zeros for all indices

    For each element in the array (from left to right):
        Compute the maximum length of the increasing subsequence ending at this index
        Iterate through all previous elements
            If current element is greater than the previous one, consider it as part of the increasing subsequence
                Update dp[i] if necessary

Memoization:
    Define a function to compute the dynamic programming values
    Store these computed results in a dictionary for future reference
    Use this dictionary to look up previously computed values when needed
