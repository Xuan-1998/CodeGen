Dynamic Programming Approach:
1. Initialize a 2D array dp with dimensions (n+1) x (m+1), where n is the length of the input array and m is the maximum possible value in the array. Set all values to 0.
2. Iterate through the array from left to right, considering each element as a potential ending point for an increasing subsequence.
3. For each element i, calculate the maximum length of an increasing subsequence that ends at position i by iterating through the previous elements and checking if they are less than or equal to the current element.
4. Update dp[i][j] with the maximum length found in step 3. If no such subsequence is found, set dp[i][j] to 0.
5. The maximum value in the last row of dp represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
