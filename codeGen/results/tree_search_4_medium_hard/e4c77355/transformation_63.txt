Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.

State S[i] is a set representing the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.

Define a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array, updating longest increasing subsequences as you go, and using previous states to compute current ones.

Use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Initialize an array dp of size n, where n is the length of the input array, such that dp[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.

Iterate through the array from left to right. For each element a[i], consider all elements b[j] in the array where j < i and b[j] <= a[i]. The maximum length of the increasing subsequence ending at a[i] is 1 plus the maximum length of the increasing subsequence ending at any of these previous elements.

Update dp[i] to be the maximum of this value and the current value dp[i].

Finally, return the maximum value in the dp array, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
