===BEGIN PLAN===
Tabulation: Use a bottom-up approach by iterating through the array and updating longest increasing subsequences as you go.

DP[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i, considering all previous elements.

Dynamic Programming: Consider each element in the array as a potential ending point for an increasing subsequence. Let DP[i] represent the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i, considering all previous elements. Transition relationship:
    If the current element is greater than the previous one,
        update DP[i] to be 1 plus the maximum length of increasing subsequences that end before this element.
    Otherwise,
        keep the same value.

Dynamic Programming: Update DP array based on previous longest increasing subsequence and current element

    Initialize a DP array with all elements set to 1, as the shortest possible increasing subsequence is a single element.

    For each element in the array:
        If it's greater than the previous one,
            update the DP value at this index by taking the maximum of the current DP value and 1 plus the DP value at the previous index.
        Otherwise,
            keep the same value.

    The length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the DP array, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index.
