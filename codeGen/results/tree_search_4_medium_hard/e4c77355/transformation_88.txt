Start from the end and work backward
State expression: The maximum length of a monotonic sequence that ends with each element.
Consider the difference between two sequences and identify how it relates to the longest increasing subsequence.
Memoization could be used by pre-computing the lengths of increasing subsequences for each element, allowing for efficient lookups when determining the longest increasing subsequence.
Check edge cases: start from the end since there may not be any increasing subsequences that start before the end
