===BEGIN PLAN===
Dynamic Programming:
  Define a recursive relation between subproblems,
  then use memoization to store computed results.

Let dp[i] be the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i in the array.

The base case: When there is only one element left, its length is considered as 1 (as it's itself).

Compute the maximum value from all subsequences as the final answer,
taking into account the current state of the dynamic programming transition.

Use a 2D table to store the lengths of longest increasing subsequences ending at each index and previous maximum value:
dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i with its last element being j.
  Initialize dp[0][j] = 1 for all j, since there's only one element in the beginning.

Transition from dp[i-1][j] to dp[i][k]:
If arr[i] > arr[k], it means that arr[i] is greater than the ending point of the subsequence.
Update dp[i][k] as the maximum between its current value and 1 + dp[i-1][j], where j is the position in previous array for which arr[j] < arr[i].

The final answer will be max(dp[n-1][]), considering all possible ending points.
