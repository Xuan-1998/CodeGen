===BEGIN PLAN===
Define dp array as the longest increasing subsequence ending at each position
Base case: If the array is empty, return 0; otherwise, consider only the first k elements and update the dp array accordingly
Dynamic programming loop:
    Initialize a maximum length to 1
    Iterate through the array from left to right:
        For each element:
            Update the maximum length if the current element is greater than the previous one
            Update the dp array with the maximum length
    Return the last value in the dp array as the length of the longest increasing subsequence
===END PLAN===
