===BEGIN PLAN===
Base case: If the array is empty, return 0.

State definition:
Let dp[i] be the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index i.
Transition relationship:
For each element arr[j] in the array, update dp[j] to max(dp[j], dp[j-1] + (arr[j] > arr[j-1]? 1 : 0)).
This transition captures the idea that the longest increasing subsequence ending at position j is either the same as the one ending at position j-1 or it includes the current element.

Dynamic programming approach:
Initialize an array dp of size n+1 to store the lengths of longest increasing subsequences.
Iterate through the array from left to right, updating dp[j] for each j using the transition relationship above.
Return dp[n] as the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the entire array.

Edge cases:
The plan already handles the empty array case. It also correctly handles the case where the input array consists only of one element (in which case the longest increasing subsequence has length 1).

Potential issues with the plan:
The plan assumes that the input array does not contain duplicate elements, as it would not affect the correctness of the solution. However, if the input array may contain duplicates and you want to handle them correctly, you could add a check for equality in the transition relationship above.
