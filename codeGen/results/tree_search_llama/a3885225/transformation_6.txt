Understand that the problem requires determining whether it's possible to convert a given binary string into a palindrome by flipping pairs of its characters. This means recognizing that flipping a character from 0 to 1 or vice versa will always result in a palindrome if done correctly.
A dictionary can be used to store the frequency of '0' and '1' characters in the binary string, enabling quick lookups.
Use dynamic programming to solve the problem. Initialize a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to convert the substring from i to j into a palindrome by flipping pairs of characters. Then, fill up the dp table based on some recurrence relation and finally check if dp[0][n-1] is true.
