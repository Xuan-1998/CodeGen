Choice 3: The challenge is to devise a method for determining whether a given binary string can be transformed into its own reverse by flipping pairs of characters. Key components include the original binary string, the reversed palindrome, and the process of matching and flipping characters to achieve this transformation.
Iterate over the binary string, checking for each character whether flipping it would result in a palindrome. If yes, update the count of flips.
