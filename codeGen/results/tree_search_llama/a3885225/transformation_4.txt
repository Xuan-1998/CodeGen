Understand that the problem requires determining whether it's possible to convert a given binary string into a palindrome by flipping pairs of its characters. This means recognizing that flipping a character from 0 to 1 or vice versa will always result in a palindrome if done correctly.
Use a boolean array to track the number of ones at each position, allowing for efficient counting and comparison.
If the total count of 1's in an array is more than half the length of the string, return 'NO' as it will not be possible to make the string a palindrome by flipping characters. Otherwise, return 'YES'.
