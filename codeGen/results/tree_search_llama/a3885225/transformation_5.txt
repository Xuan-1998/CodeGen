Understand that the problem requires determining whether it's possible to convert a given binary string into a palindrome by flipping pairs of its characters. This means recognizing that flipping a character from 0 to 1 or vice versa will always result in a palindrome if done correctly.
A dictionary can be used to store the frequency of '0' and '1' characters in the binary string, enabling quick lookups.
Create a recursive function that takes the current index and the frequency dictionary as inputs, and returns whether it's possible to convert the remaining string into a palindrome by flipping pairs of characters. The base case can be when the index exceeds half the length of the binary string, at which point all characters have been processed.
