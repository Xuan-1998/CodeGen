Choice 1: The problem statement is about identifying whether a given binary string can be converted to a palindrome by flipping pairs of its characters. Key components include the binary string itself, which can have any length, and the requirement to flip pairs of characters to form a palindrome.
The algorithm needs an input that contains the length N of the binary string and the binary string itself. The output should be either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether it is possible to convert the given binary string to a palindrome.\
