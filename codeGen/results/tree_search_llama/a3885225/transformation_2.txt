Understand that the problem requires determining whether it's possible to convert a given binary string into a palindrome by flipping pairs of its characters. This means recognizing that flipping a character from 0 to 1 or vice versa will always result in a palindrome if done correctly.
Use a boolean array to track the number of ones at each position, allowing for efficient counting and comparison.
Create a variable to store the number of 1's at each position, starting from the middle of the string and moving towards both ends. This will help in counting the number of flips required to make the string a palindrome.
