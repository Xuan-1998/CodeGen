Choice 2: The problem involves analyzing a binary string to determine if it's possible to make all characters equal (i.e., either all 0s or all 1s) by flipping pairs. Key components include the initial binary string, the number of flips required, and the goal of achieving an all-equal state.
One possible approach is to initialize a variable to track the number of flips required. Iterate over the binary string, counting the number of characters that need to be flipped to achieve an all-equal state. This could involve using a dictionary or list to store character frequencies and updating them as you iterate. Time complexity would depend on the length of the input string, potentially O(N), where N is the length of the string. Space efficiency could be achieved by minimizing data structures used.
