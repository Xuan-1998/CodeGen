Understand that the problem requires determining whether it's possible to convert a given binary string into a palindrome by flipping pairs of its characters. This means recognizing that flipping a character from 0 to 1 or vice versa will always result in a palindrome if done correctly.
A list or array can be employed to maintain the running count of '0's and '1's as you iterate through the string.
