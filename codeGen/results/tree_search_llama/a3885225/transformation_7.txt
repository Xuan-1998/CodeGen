Choice 1: The problem statement is about identifying whether a given binary string can be converted to a palindrome by flipping pairs of its characters. Key components include the binary string itself, which can have any length, and the requirement to flip pairs of characters to form a palindrome.
Given a binary string S of length N, determine whether it is possible to convert S to a palindrome by flipping pairs of its characters. This means that the problem requires an input string S and outputs either YES or NO depending on whether the conversion is possible.\
Create a loop that iterates over the binary string, checking for pairs of characters that can be flipped to form a palindrome. Compare each pair to its mirrored counterpart in the reversed string. If any mismatch is found, immediately return NO. If all pairs match or there are no unmatched pairs left, return YES.
