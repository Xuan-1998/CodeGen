Choice 2: The problem involves analyzing a binary string to determine if it's possible to make all characters equal (i.e., either all 0s or all 1s) by flipping pairs. Key components include the initial binary string, the number of flips required, and the goal of achieving an all-equal state.
Another way to approach this problem is to focus on the total number of flips needed rather than individual characters. Count the number of 0s and 1s in the binary string separately, then calculate the difference between these counts. If the difference is greater than 0, it's not possible to make all characters equal by flipping pairs; otherwise, the number of flips required would be the absolute difference between the two counts. This approach could have a time complexity of O(1) if you only need to count the characters once.
