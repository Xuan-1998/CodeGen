Understand that the problem requires determining whether it's possible to convert a given binary string into a palindrome by flipping pairs of its characters. This means recognizing that flipping a character from 0 to 1 or vice versa will always result in a palindrome if done correctly.
Use a boolean array to track the number of ones at each position, allowing for efficient counting and comparison.
For every pair of characters, check if they are the same or not. If they are the same, increment a counter for the number of pairs that don't need to be flipped. If they're different, decrement the counter because one flip is needed for this pair.
