Finding a two-dimensional array representing the chessboard pattern, with white cells represented by the character 'O' and black cells represented by the character 'X'.
Use a manipulation operation to alternate between white and black cells based on the parity of the row and column indices.
['Trees', specifically a binary tree, where each node represents a cell in the chessboard pattern, and we can recursively traverse the tree to generate the alternating pattern]
