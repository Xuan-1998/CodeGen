The problem statement requires creating a string representation of the chessboard pattern, where each character represents either a black or white cell. The desired output is a string that can be easily printed to standard output.
Using a hash map or dictionary to store cell colors

Test the implementation by checking for specific edge cases, such as an empty chessboard (0x0) or a single-cell chessboard (1x1), to ensure it handles these cases correctly.
