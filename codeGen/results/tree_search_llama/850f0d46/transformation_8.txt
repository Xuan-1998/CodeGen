Finding a two-dimensional array representing the chessboard pattern, with white cells represented by the character 'O' and black cells represented by the character 'X'.
Employ string algorithms like bit manipulation or cyclic rotation to generate the chessboard pattern.
Utilize dynamic programming to recursively construct the chessboard pattern, considering the constraints of input integers.
