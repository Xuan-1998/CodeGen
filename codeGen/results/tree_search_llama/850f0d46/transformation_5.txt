Finding a two-dimensional array representing the chessboard pattern, with white cells represented by the character 'O' and black cells represented by the character 'X'.
Determine if searching for specific patterns (e.g., 'O' or 'X') is required, and develop an algorithm accordingly.
Employ the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm to find all occurrences of the pattern 'O' or 'X' within the chessboard pattern, taking into account the row and column sizes.
