Finding a two-dimensional array representing the chessboard pattern, with white cells represented by the character 'O' and black cells represented by the character 'X'.
Determine if searching for specific patterns (e.g., 'O' or 'X') is required, and develop an algorithm accordingly.
Implement a Boyer-Moore algorithm to efficiently search for specific patterns in the chessboard pattern. Preprocess the pattern and the entire chessboard pattern to create a lookup table for efficient searching.
