The problem statement requires creating a string representation of the chessboard pattern, where each character represents either a black or white cell. The desired output is a string that can be easily printed to standard output.
Using a hash map or dictionary to store cell colors

Test the implementation by generating chessboard patterns for different numbers of rows (e.g., 2, 3, 4) and columns (e.g., 2, 3, 4), verifying that the output matches expected patterns.
