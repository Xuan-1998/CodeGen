Finding a two-dimensional array representing the chessboard pattern, with white cells represented by the character 'O' and black cells represented by the character 'X'.
Use a manipulation operation to alternate between white and black cells based on the parity of the row and column indices.
['Arrays with nested lists', as we can store each row as a list within another list to create a 2D array]
