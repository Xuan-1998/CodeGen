Finding a two-dimensional array representing the chessboard pattern, with white cells represented by the character 'O' and black cells represented by the character 'X'.
Employ string algorithms like bit manipulation or cyclic rotation to generate the chessboard pattern.
Apply cyclic rotation on the string representation of chessboard pattern to generate alternating black and white cells.
