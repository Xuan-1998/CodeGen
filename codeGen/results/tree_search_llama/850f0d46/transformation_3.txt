Finding a two-dimensional array representing the chessboard pattern, with white cells represented by the character 'O' and black cells represented by the character 'X'.
Determine if searching for specific patterns (e.g., 'O' or 'X') is required, and develop an algorithm accordingly.
Use a simple iteration approach to generate the chessboard pattern. Initialize an empty 2D array with rows * columns size, then iterate through each cell, checking its row number modulo 2. If it's 0, fill the cell with 'O' (white), otherwise fill it with 'X' (black).
