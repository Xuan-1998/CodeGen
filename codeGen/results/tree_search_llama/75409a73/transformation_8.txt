Understand the problem statement by breaking it down into smaller components. Identify what you need to do (calculate the factorial of each integer n) and what inputs are given (integer t followed by t lines with single integers n).
Recursion
Consider optimizing the recursive function by using memoization or tabulation to reduce the number of redundant calculations.
