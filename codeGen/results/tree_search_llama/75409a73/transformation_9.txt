Understand the problem statement by breaking it down into smaller components. Identify what you need to do (calculate the factorial of each integer n) and what inputs are given (integer t followed by t lines with single integers n).
Recursion
Widen the scope of testing by including edge cases (e.g., n=0 or negative integers) and verify that the solution handles them correctly.
