Understand the problem statement by breaking it down into smaller components. Identify what you need to do (calculate the factorial of each integer n) and what inputs are given (integer t followed by t lines with single integers n).
You can use recursion to define a function that calculates the factorial of a given number. This approach is particularly useful when you need to perform the calculation multiple times.
