Understand the problem statement by breaking it down into smaller components. Identify what you need to do (calculate the factorial of each integer n) and what inputs are given (integer t followed by t lines with single integers n).
Recursion
Check if the current implementation accurately calculates the factorial for small input values. If it does, then it's likely to work correctly for all inputs.
