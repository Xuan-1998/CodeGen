Determine the range of values that t and n can take (1 ≤ t ≤ 100, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and use this information to develop a strategy for solving the problem.
Choice 2: Use mathematical formula for calculating factorial directly. This option would involve developing an equation that represents the factorial of a number and then applying mathematical manipulations to solve the problem.
