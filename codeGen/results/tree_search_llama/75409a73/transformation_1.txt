1. The problem can be viewed as calculating the factorial of each integer n given in the input. The primary input parameter is t, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, we need to calculate the factorial of the corresponding value of n and display it accordingly.

There might be a case where t is 0, which would require handling this scenario differently than when t is greater than 1. Perhaps we can return some kind of error message in this case.
