Recognize that the problem is about calculating the factorial of each integer n, which is a basic arithmetic operation in mathematics. Define the problem by identifying the necessary calculations to perform this operation.
Verify that the calculated factorials are accurate by comparing them with pre-computed values for small inputs, and consider implementing a recursive function to calculate the factorials.
