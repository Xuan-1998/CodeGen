Recognize that the problem is about calculating the factorial of each integer n, which is a basic arithmetic operation in mathematics. Define the problem by identifying the necessary calculations to perform this operation.
Avoid overflow errors by checking if the calculated factorial exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 2^31 - 1), and consider implementing a modulo operation or using a large integer library if necessary.
