Determine the range of values that t and n can take (1 ≤ t ≤ 100, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and use this information to develop a strategy for solving the problem.
Choice 3: Loop-based iterative calculation of factorials. This choice involves using a loop to iteratively calculate the factorial of each given number.
