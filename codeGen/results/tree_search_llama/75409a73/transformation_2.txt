1. The problem can be viewed as calculating the factorial of each integer n given in the input. The primary input parameter is t, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, we need to calculate the factorial of the corresponding value of n and display it accordingly.

There could be an edge case where n is less than 1, which would cause issues with calculating the factorial. We may need to handle this by returning a specific value or error message.
