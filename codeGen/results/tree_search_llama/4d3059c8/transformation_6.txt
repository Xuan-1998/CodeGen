Use a data structure like a running total list where you keep track of the cumulative sum as you iterate through the array, allowing for constant time complexity to calculate the sum of elements to the left and right.
Use a single pass to calculate both the left and right cumulative sums simultaneously. Initialize two variables, one to store the left sum and another to store the total sum. Then, iterate through the input array, updating these variables with each element. Store the current total sum in an empty list. Next, find the pivot index by iterating through the stored sums list and checking if any given sum is equal to half the total sum.
