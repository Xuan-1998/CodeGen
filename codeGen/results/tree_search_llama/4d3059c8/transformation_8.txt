Choose a data structure that can efficiently calculate the sum of elements to its left and right. For instance, you could use an array with a prefix sum array or a balanced binary search tree.
An array with prefix sum calculation to efficiently calculate the sum of elements to its left
Using a balanced binary search tree, you can calculate the sum of elements to its left and right for each node by traversing the tree from left to right. For each node, compare the sum of elements to its left with the sum of elements to its right. If they are equal, that's your pivot index. If not, move on to the next node.
