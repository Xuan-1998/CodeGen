Choose a data structure that can efficiently calculate the sum of elements to its left and right. For instance, you could use an array with a prefix sum array or a balanced binary search tree.
An array with prefix sum calculation to efficiently calculate the sum of elements to its left
Using an array with prefix sum calculation, you can iterate through the array once. For each element, calculate the total sum so far (which would be the sum of elements to its left) and store it in a new array. Then, compare this sum with the total sum minus the current element (which would be the sum of elements to its right). If they are equal, that's your pivot index. If not, move on to the next element.
