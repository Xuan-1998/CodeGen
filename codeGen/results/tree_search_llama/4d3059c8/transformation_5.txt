Use a data structure like a running total list where you keep track of the cumulative sum as you iterate through the array, allowing for constant time complexity to calculate the sum of elements to the left and right.
Use a hash map to store the cumulative sums as you iterate through the array. Initialize an empty dictionary where keys are indices and values are cumulative sums. Then, iterate through the input array, updating the hash map with the current index and cumulative sum. Next, find the pivot index by iterating through the hash map and checking if the left sum is equal to the right sum for any given index.
