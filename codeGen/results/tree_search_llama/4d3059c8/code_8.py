This code first calculates the total sum of the array. Then, it iterates through the array and keeps track of the cumulative sum (left_sum). At each step, it checks if the left_sum is equal to the total_sum minus the left_sum. If so, that's the pivot index. If not, it moves on to the next element.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array, since we're iterating through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) as we're only using a constant amount of space to store the left_sum and total_sum.

Now, let's analyze your idea about using a balanced binary search tree:

While this approach could work in theory, it would be more complicated than the prefix sum approach. You'd need to create a balanced binary search tree from the array and then traverse the tree, which would increase the time complexity. This solution would likely have a higher time complexity than O(n) and would require more space to store the tree.

In summary, your initial idea about using an efficient data structure to calculate the sum of elements to its left and right was on the right track. By using prefix sums, we can efficiently solve this problem in linear time with a constant amount of space.
