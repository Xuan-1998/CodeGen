Use a data structure like a running total list where you keep track of the cumulative sum as you iterate through the array, allowing for constant time complexity to calculate the sum of elements to the left and right.
Use a cumulative sum list where you keep track of the running total as you iterate through the array. Initialize an empty list to store the cumulative sums. Then, iterate through the input array, adding each element to the current cumulative sum. Store this updated sum in the list. Next, find the pivot index by iterating through the cumulative sum list and checking if the left sum is equal to the right sum for any given index.
