A data structure that allows efficient calculation of cumulative sums (prefix sum) could be used. This would enable easy computation of the total sum on either side of each element.
Iterate through the prefix sum array from left to right. For each element, subtract its value from the current running total to find the sum of numbers to the left. Then, compare this sum with the corresponding running total (i.e., the sum of numbers to the right). If they match, return the current index as the pivot.
