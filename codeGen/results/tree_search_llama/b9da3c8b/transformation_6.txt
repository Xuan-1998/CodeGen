Read an integer n as input, representing the number of events. Then, read n space-separated integers as input.
Use a priority queue to keep track of available officers. As you read in each new group of recruits, update the priority queue accordingly. When a crime occurs, pop off the top officer from the queue (if it's not empty) and mark the crime as solved. If the queue is empty when a crime occurs, increment a counter for untreated crimes.
Read in some test cases: \n1. n = 5, event sequence = -1 2 -1 3 -1 4; Expected output: 2\n2. n = 7, event sequence = -1 2 -1 3 -1 4 5 6 -1; Expected output: 3\n3. n = 10, event sequence = -1 2 -1 3 -1 4 5 6 -1 7 8 9 10 -1; Expected output: 0
