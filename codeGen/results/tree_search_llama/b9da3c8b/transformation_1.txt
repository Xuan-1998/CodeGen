Read an integer n as input, representing the number of events. Then, read n space-separated integers as input.
Use an array to keep track of available officers, where each index represents the number of officers available at that time. As you read in each new group of recruits, update the array accordingly. When a crime occurs, find the smallest non-negative value in the array (if it's not empty) and mark the crime as solved. If the array is empty when a crime occurs, increment a counter for untreated crimes.
