Read an integer n as input, representing the number of events. Then, read n space-separated integers as input.
Implement a binary search tree to keep track of available officers. As you read in each new group of recruits, update the BST accordingly. When a crime occurs, find the leftmost officer (if it's not null) and mark the crime as solved. If the BST is empty when a crime occurs, increment a counter for untreated crimes.
