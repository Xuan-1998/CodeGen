4. Otherwise, the integer will be positive, the number of officers recruited together at that time.\n
To solve this problem, I would use a queue data structure to store the availability of police officers. When an officer is hired, they're added to the end of the queue. Then, when a crime occurs, if there are any officers available in the queue (i.e., their count is greater than 0), one officer's count decrements by 1 and they become unavailable for the next crime. If the queue is empty when a crime occurs, then it goes untreated. The program counts the number of crimes that go untreated.
