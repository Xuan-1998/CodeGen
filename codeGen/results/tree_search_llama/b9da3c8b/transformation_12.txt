4. Otherwise, the integer will be positive, the number of officers recruited together at that time.\n
To solve this problem, I would keep track of the total police force available at any given time using a variable. Each time an officer is hired, the total police force increases by that many. Then, when a crime occurs, if the total police force is greater than or equal to 1, it means there's at least one officer free to investigate the crime and the total police force decreases by 1. If the total police force is less than 1, then there are no officers free to investigate the crime so it goes untreated. Finally, the program counts the number of crimes that go untreated.
