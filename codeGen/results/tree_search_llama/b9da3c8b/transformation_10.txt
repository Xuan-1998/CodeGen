4. Otherwise, the integer will be positive, the number of officers recruited together at that time.\n
To solve this problem, I would maintain a variable to keep track of the current available police force. Each time an officer is hired, the available police force increases by that many. Then, when a crime occurs, if the available police force is greater than or equal to 1, it means there's at least one officer free to investigate the crime and the available police force decreases by 1. If the available police force is less than 1, then there are no officers free to investigate the crime so it goes untreated. Finally, the program counts the number of crimes that go untreated and prints out the result.
