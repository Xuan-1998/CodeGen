An array scenario where certain elements' positions in the array match their corresponding value.
A hash map or dictionary to quickly look up and store the matching indices.
Use a Python set data structure to efficiently store the indices where Arr[i] = i. Iterate through the array, and for each element, check if its value is equal to its index. If true, add the index to the set. Finally, return the set as the output (as it will automatically remove any duplicate indices).
