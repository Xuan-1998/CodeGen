An array scenario where certain elements' positions in the array match their corresponding value.
A set or collection to efficiently keep track of unique indices.
Choose an efficient data structure, such as a HashSet in Java or a set in Python, to store the indices where Arr[i] = i. Then, iterate over the array and check each element's value against its index; if it matches, add the index to the set. Finally, return the set converted to a list.
