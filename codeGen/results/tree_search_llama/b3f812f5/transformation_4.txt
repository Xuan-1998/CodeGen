An array scenario where certain elements' positions in the array match their corresponding value.
A hash map or dictionary to quickly look up and store the matching indices.
Implement a Python list comprehension that creates a new list containing the indices where Arr[i] = i. This can be done by iterating through the array and checking if each element is equal to its index. The resulting list of matching indices can then be returned as the solution.
