An array scenario where certain elements' positions in the array match their corresponding value.
A set or collection to efficiently keep track of unique indices.
Use a dictionary (or map) to keep track of unique indices. Iterate over the array and for each element at index i, check if Arr[i] = i. If so, add the index to the dictionary. Then, return a list comprehension that returns all keys in the dictionary. This way, you'll have an ordered list of indices where Arr[i] = i.
