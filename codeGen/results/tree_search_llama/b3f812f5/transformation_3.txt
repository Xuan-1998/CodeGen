An array scenario where certain elements' positions in the array match their corresponding value.
A hash map or dictionary to quickly look up and store the matching indices.
Use a Python dictionary (hash map) to store the indices where Arr[i] = i. Iterate through the array, and for each element, check if its value is equal to its index. If true, add the index to the dictionary's key-value pair. Finally, return the dictionary keys as the output.
