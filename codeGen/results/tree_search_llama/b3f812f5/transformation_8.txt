An array scenario where certain elements' positions in the array match their corresponding value.
A set or collection to efficiently keep track of unique indices.
Implement a simple loop-based solution by iterating over the array and checking each element's value against its index. If it matches, add the index to a list (or another data structure of your choice). Once the iteration is complete, return the resulting list.
