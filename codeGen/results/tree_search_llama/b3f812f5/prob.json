"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given an array Arr of N positive integers, find the indices where the value of the element is equal to its index value (1-based indexing). The task can be represented as finding all i such that Arr[i] = i.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of two integers, N and Arr[], where N represents the number of elements in the array and Arr[] represents the array of N positive integers. The input is received from standard input.\\n\\nOutput: The output is an array of indices where the given conditions are satisfied. If no such element exists, then an empty array of length 0 is returned.\\n\\nConstraints: The input array Arr[] has N positive integers such that 1 \\u2264 N \\u2264 10^{5} and 1 \\u2264 Arr[i] \\u2264 10^{6}.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Data structures', 'Complete search']\", \"difficulties\": \"EASY\", \"source\": \"geeksforgeeks\", \"url\": \"https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/value-equal-to-index-value1330/1\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"N = 5\\r\\nArr[] = {15, 2, 45, 12, 7}\", \"output\": \"2\"}, {\"input\": \"N = 1\\r\\nArr[] = {1}\", \"output\": \"1\"}]}"
