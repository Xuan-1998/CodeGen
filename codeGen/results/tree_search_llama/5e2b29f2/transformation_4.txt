Split the string into substrings based on certain patterns or keywords, and then categorize the meme based on the pattern that matches first.
Use regular expressions to search for patterns in the string that correspond to different categories
Write a set of test cases with expected outputs for each category (IT, chemistry, design, other). Then, use a timing mechanism like time() function in Python to measure the execution time of your code. You can compare these times with and without optimizations implemented. This will help you identify performance bottlenecks.
