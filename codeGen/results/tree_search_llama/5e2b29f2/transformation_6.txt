Split the string into substrings based on certain patterns or keywords, and then categorize the meme based on the pattern that matches first.
Use regular expressions to search for patterns in the string that correspond to different categories
Implement caching mechanisms using Python's built-in dictionary or a third-party library like functools.lru_cache. This can be particularly effective if you find yourself recomputing the same sub-problems multiple times during the categorization process.
