Define the problem as finding connected components in an undirected graph, where each vertex represents a relative of PolandBall and two vertices are connected if they share a common ancestor. The goal is to find the number of trees in the forest by identifying all connected components and counting their sizes.
Traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search would be suitable for this problem as they can efficiently explore all connected components in an undirected graph and identify the number of trees in the forest.
'Breadth-First Search (BFS) is also a suitable choice for this problem. Start by choosing an arbitrary vertex as the root node, then explore all vertices at the current level before moving on to the next level. This approach ensures that you visit all vertices in the same connected component before moving on to the next one.
