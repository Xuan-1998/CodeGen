Implement a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse each tree individually.
Consider edge cases where a tree may have less than k-1 edges, indicating that some vertices are not connected to others in the tree. In such cases, adjust the algorithm's logic to accommodate these disconnected components and ensure accurate counting of trees.
