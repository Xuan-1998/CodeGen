Define the problem as finding connected components in an undirected graph, where each vertex represents a relative of PolandBall and two vertices are connected if they share a common ancestor. The goal is to find the number of trees in the forest by identifying all connected components and counting their sizes.
DFS would be suitable for this problem as it can efficiently explore all connected components in an undirected graph and identify the number of trees in the forest.
