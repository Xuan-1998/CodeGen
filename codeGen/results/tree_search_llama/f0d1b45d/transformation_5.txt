Implement a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse each tree individually.
Implement a cycle detection mechanism using a visited set and a stack to keep track of visited nodes. If a node is revisited, it indicates the presence of a cycle, which can be handled by terminating the DFS traversal or modifying the algorithm's behavior accordingly.
