Define the problem as finding connected components in an undirected graph, where each vertex represents a relative of PolandBall and two vertices are connected if they share a common ancestor. The goal is to find the number of trees in the forest by identifying all connected components and counting their sizes.
Traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search would be suitable for this problem as they can efficiently explore all connected components in an undirected graph and identify the number of trees in the forest.
Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the graph, starting from a randomly chosen vertex. For each visited vertex, mark its parent in the DFS traversal and keep track of the current connected component's size.
