This code defines a recursive DFS function that traverses each tree in the forest. It keeps track of the size of each tree by incrementing a counter for each vertex visited. The total number of trees is then simply the count of unique root vertices.

Note: This solution assumes that the input is valid, i.e., it represents some valid forest.
