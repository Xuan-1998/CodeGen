Define the problem as finding connected components in an undirected graph, where each vertex represents a relative of PolandBall and two vertices are connected if they share a common ancestor. The goal is to find the number of trees in the forest by identifying all connected components and counting their sizes.
BFS could also be used to solve this problem by treating each tree as a separate level in the BFS traversal, but DFS might be more efficient due to its ability to detect cycles early on.
Use a recursive DFS approach to implement the tree data structure and traverse the forest: This approach uses a stack to keep track of vertices to visit and can be efficient for trees with many levels.
