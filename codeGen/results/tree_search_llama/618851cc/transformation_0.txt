Define the problem: Given two arrays A and B of positive integers, find a pair (a,b) such that a belongs to A, b belongs to B, but a+b is not in both sets. The input consists of four lines: an integer n representing the number of elements in array A, followed by n space-separated integers ai, then an integer m representing the number of elements in array B, followed by m space-separated integers bi. The output should be a single line with the pair (a,b). Constraints include 1≤n,m≤100 and 1≤ai,bi≤200.
