The problem requires us to design a dynamic data structure that can accommodate any number of input arrays. This could involve creating an array of arrays, where each sub-array represents an input array, and then iterating through these sub-arrays to generate the output array.
Implement a custom class or struct to create a dynamic data structure that can handle any number of input arrays. For example, you could create a class called 'ArrayContainer' with methods for adding and retrieving arrays.
