The problem requires us to design a dynamic data structure that can accommodate any number of input arrays. This could involve creating an array of arrays, where each sub-array represents an input array, and then iterating through these sub-arrays to generate the output array.
Use a list of lists to store the input arrays: This approach involves creating a list where each element is another list representing an input array.
