The problem requires us to design a dynamic data structure that can accommodate any number of input arrays. This could involve creating an array of arrays, where each sub-array represents an input array, and then iterating through these sub-arrays to generate the output array.
Use a tuple of tuples or an array of arrays to store the input arrays: This approach is similar to using a list of lists, but it uses tuples or arrays instead, which may provide slightly better performance or memory usage depending on the language.
