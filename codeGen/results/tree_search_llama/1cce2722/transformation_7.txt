Divide the problem into smaller subproblems: Create a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the maximum points earned by deleting elements from the sequence up to index i, given that the last element deleted was at index j.
Create a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the maximum points earned by deleting elements from the sequence up to index i, given that the last element deleted was at index j. Then, fill this table in a bottom-up manner using the following recursive formula: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k-1] + 1 for k in range(j+1, i+1) if ak = aj or ak = aj - 1).
dp[i][j] = sum(1 for k in range(i) if k != j and (a[k] - a[j]) % 2 == 0) + dp[i-1][j]
