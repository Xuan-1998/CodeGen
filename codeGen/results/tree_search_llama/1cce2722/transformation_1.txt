Divide the problem into smaller subproblems: Create a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the maximum points earned by deleting elements from the sequence up to index i, given that the last element deleted was at index j.
Consider the sequence as a graph where nodes represent elements and edges represent the deletion relationships between adjacent elements. Then, use dynamic programming to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in this graph, which corresponds to the maximum number of points earned by deleting elements from the sequence.
