Divide the problem into smaller subproblems: Create a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the maximum points earned by deleting elements from the sequence up to index i, given that the last element deleted was at index j.
Divide the problem into smaller subproblems by considering all possible deletion scenarios up to index i. Then, solve each subproblem independently using a recursive function that takes the current sequence and the last element deleted as input. Store the results of the subproblems in a table so that you don't have to recompute them.
