Divide the problem into smaller subproblems: Create a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the maximum points earned by deleting elements from the sequence up to index i, given that the last element deleted was at index j.
Create a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the maximum points earned by deleting elements from the sequence up to index i, given that the last element deleted was at index j. Then, fill this table in a bottom-up manner using the following recursive formula: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][k-1] + 1 for k in range(j+1, i+1) if ak = aj or ak = aj - 1).
for i from n-1 down to 1: dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], 1+dp[i-2] if i > 1 and (a[i] - a[i-1]) % 2 == 0 else dp[i-1])
