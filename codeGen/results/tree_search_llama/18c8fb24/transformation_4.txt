The problem involves periodic motion, which can be analyzed using Fourier analysis or other methods from number theory.
Modular arithmetic
Firstly, we can use the fact that the ball's motion is periodic with period k. This means that we only need to consider the ball's position at the start of each period. We can then use modular arithmetic to determine if the ball will enter the hole. Specifically, if x ≡ 0 (mod k) or x ≡ N+1 (mod k), then the ball will enter the hole. Otherwise, we can calculate the remainder when N+1 is divided by k and check if it's equal to x. If so, then the ball will enter the hole. Otherwise, we can be certain that the ball won't enter the hole.
