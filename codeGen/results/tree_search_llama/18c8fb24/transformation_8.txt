A player is standing at one end of the hallway and needs to hit the ball so that it enters the hole on its forward journey. However, the ball will bounce back at each interval of k.
Model the scenario using differential equations: Define a system of differential equations to describe the ball's position and velocity as functions of time. Use these equations to analyze the behavior of the ball as it bounces along the hallway, considering the effect of the interval k on the trajectory.
