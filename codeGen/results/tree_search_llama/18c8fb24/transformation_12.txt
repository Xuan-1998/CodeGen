The hallway is a representation of a number line with positive integers representing tile positions. The goal is to find the relationship between x, N, and k to determine if the ball will enter the hole.
The key insight is that the ball's trajectory can be modeled using a recursive function, which takes into account the initial position, the distance between tiles, and the interval at which the ball bounces.
