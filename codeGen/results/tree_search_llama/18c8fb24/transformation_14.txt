Imagine a ball being thrown from one end of the hallway with bounces at intervals of k. The ball will enter the hole if its final position after bouncing is equal to x.
The number of bounces (n) is directly proportional to the distance traveled by the ball.
Represent the situation using a graph where the x-axis represents the number of bounces (n) and the y-axis represents the position of the ball after each bounce. The goal is to find when the ball's position intersects with x.
