The problem involves periodic motion, which can be analyzed using Fourier analysis or other methods from number theory.
Modular arithmetic
Finally, we could use a more brute-force approach and simulate the ball's motion for k periods. We would start at position x and move the ball one tile at a time, checking if it enters the hole after each period. If it does, then we can output 'YES'. If not, then we can output 'NO'.
