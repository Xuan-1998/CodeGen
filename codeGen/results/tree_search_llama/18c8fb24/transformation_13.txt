Imagine a ball being thrown from one end of the hallway with bounces at intervals of k. The ball will enter the hole if its final position after bouncing is equal to x.
The number of bounces (n) is directly proportional to the distance traveled by the ball.
Visualize the trajectory of the ball as a function of its bounce number n, with x representing the hole position and k being the interval between bounces.
