The hallway is a representation of a number line with positive integers representing tile positions. The goal is to find the relationship between x, N, and k to determine if the ball will enter the hole.
Consider the trajectory of the ball as it bounces from one end of the hallway to the other. The key insight is that the ball's position at each bounce can be represented by a mathematical function, which can be used to determine if the ball will enter the hole.
