Imagine a ball being thrown from one end of the hallway with bounces at intervals of k. The ball will enter the hole if its final position after bouncing is equal to x.
Let t be the time taken for the ball to travel from one end of the hallway. The relationship between t and k is that t = k when the ball hits the floor after its first bounce.
