A player is standing at one end of the hallway and needs to hit the ball so that it enters the hole on its forward journey. However, the ball will bounce back at each interval of k.
Determine the trajectory using geometric series: Treat the hallway as a discrete geometric series with a common ratio equal to the fraction of the total length that the ball travels between each bounce. Use this concept to calculate the cumulative distance traveled by the ball and determine if it enters the hole on its forward journey.
