The hallway is a representation of a number line with positive integers representing tile positions. The goal is to find the relationship between x, N, and k to determine if the ball will enter the hole.
Analyze the pattern of bounces and their relationship to x and k. This may involve considering modular arithmetic or periodic functions, as the ball's position repeats with each bounce.
