A player is standing at one end of the hallway and needs to hit the ball so that it enters the hole on its forward journey. However, the ball will bounce back at each interval of k.
Describe the scenario using linear algebra: Consider the ball's position as a vector in the hallway. With each bounce, the ball's velocity is reflected about the x-axis, but its position remains unchanged. Apply the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors to find the direction of the bouncing trajectory, which can be used to determine if it enters the hole on its forward journey.
