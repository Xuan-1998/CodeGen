Imagine a ball being thrown from one end of the hallway with bounces at intervals of k. The ball will enter the hole if its final position after bouncing is equal to x.
The number of bounces (n) is directly proportional to the distance traveled by the ball.
Use a graphing tool to plot the function f(n) = n*k + x, which represents the ball's position after n bounces, and identify where it crosses the x-axis.
