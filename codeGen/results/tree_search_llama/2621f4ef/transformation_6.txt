Define the problem statement: Consider a 2D Cartesian plane with n mines of valuable resources. The goal is to find the minimum possible area (in square units) that can cover all the mines by building a square city, where its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
, 
Start by sorting the mine coordinates in ascending order along both x- and y-axes. This allows for efficient pruning of the search space when considering potential city boundaries.
