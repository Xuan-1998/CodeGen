Define the problem statement: Given the coordinates of n mines on a 2D Cartesian plane, identify the smallest enclosing rectangle (city) with minimum area that contains all the mines. The goal is to find this rectangle's dimensions and calculate its area.
Brute Force Approach: Initialize four variables (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y) to store the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates. Iterate through each mine's coordinates, updating these variables accordingly. Finally, calculate the area as the product of the differences between max_x and min_x and max_y and min_y.
