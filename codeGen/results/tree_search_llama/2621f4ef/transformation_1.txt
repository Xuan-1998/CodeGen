Divide the coordinate plane into rectangular areas based on the possible city sizes. This can be done by creating a grid of points that represent different city sizes.
Define the objective function by identifying the smallest axis-aligned box that encloses all the mines, measured by its length and width. This approach focuses on minimizing the city's size while covering all valuable resources.
Interval Heuristic Search
Implement the search algorithm: Write code to execute the chosen strategy, considering data structures, optimization techniques, and error handling.
Use a timing function to measure the execution time of the algorithm and analyze its performance on different inputs, identifying areas for optimization and refinement.
