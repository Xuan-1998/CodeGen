Define the problem statement: Given the coordinates of n mines on a 2D Cartesian plane, identify the smallest enclosing rectangle (city) with minimum area that contains all the mines. The goal is to find this rectangle's dimensions and calculate its area.
Divide-and-Conquer Method: Recursively subdivide the space into smaller rectangles until no further subdivision is possible. Then, combine the areas of the sub-rectangles to find the minimum enclosing rectangle's area.
