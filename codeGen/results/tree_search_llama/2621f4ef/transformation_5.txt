Define the problem statement: Imagine a city that can be represented as a square on a 2D grid. The city must contain n valuable resource mines located at specific coordinates. The goal is to determine the side length of the smallest possible square city that covers all the mines.
Implement a binary search with a start point being the maximum possible side length and end point being 1. Stop when the difference between the start and end points is less than a certain threshold
