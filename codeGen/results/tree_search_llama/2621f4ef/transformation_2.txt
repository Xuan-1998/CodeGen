Define the problem statement: Given the coordinates of n mines on a 2D Cartesian plane, identify the smallest enclosing rectangle (city) with minimum area that contains all the mines. The goal is to find this rectangle's dimensions and calculate its area.
Convex Hull Approach: Compute the convex hull of the mine coordinates using a sweep line algorithm or a monotone chain algorithm. Then, calculate the area as the product of the lengths of the two chords that form the city's boundary.
