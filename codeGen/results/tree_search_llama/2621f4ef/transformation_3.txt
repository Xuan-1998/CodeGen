Define the problem statement: Imagine a city that can be represented as a square on a 2D grid. The city must contain n valuable resource mines located at specific coordinates. The goal is to determine the side length of the smallest possible square city that covers all the mines.
Check if the current calculated area exceeds the sum of the areas of the two smaller sides squared, then stop searching.
