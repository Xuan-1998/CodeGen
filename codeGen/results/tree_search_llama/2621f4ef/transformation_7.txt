Define the problem statement: Consider a 2D Cartesian plane with n mines of valuable resources. The goal is to find the minimum possible area (in square units) that can cover all the mines by building a square city, where its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
, 
Investigate using a brute-force approach to generate all possible squares that can cover the mines, and then find the smallest one that has the minimum area. You can use nested loops to iterate over the possible square sizes and coordinates.
