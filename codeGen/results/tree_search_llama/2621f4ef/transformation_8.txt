Define the problem statement: Consider a 2D Cartesian plane with n mines of valuable resources. The goal is to find the minimum possible area (in square units) that can cover all the mines by building a square city, where its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
, 
Apply a divide-and-conquer strategy by recursively finding the minimum area for each group of mines, until you have processed all the mines. Then, combine these groups into a single city with the minimum area.
