The task is to find the closest multiple of 5 for each number in the given array
Another way to approach this problem is to think about the concept of 'rounding'. We could round each number in the array down or up to the nearest multiple of 5. This would involve comparing each number to its nearest multiple of 5 and determining whether it's closer to the lower or higher multiple.
