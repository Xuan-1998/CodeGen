A program that takes an array of floating point numbers as input, rounds each number to its nearest multiple of 5, and produces the rounded array as output.
The input is a list of floating point numbers without any formatting constraints. The output is a list of integers where each number is the nearest multiple of 5 to the corresponding number in the input list.
Implement the algorithm using programming language syntax (e.g., Python)
