Round each number in the input array to the nearest multiple of 5
The time complexity would be O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we need to iterate through each element once to round it to the nearest multiple of 5. The space complexity would also be O(n) as we might need to store the rounded numbers in a new array.
