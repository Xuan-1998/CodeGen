The task is to find the closest multiple of 5 for each number in the given array
A third option could be to use mathematical properties, such as the fact that every real number can be written uniquely as a sum of an integer and a fraction with denominator 5. We could then use this property to find the closest multiple of 5 for each number in the array.
