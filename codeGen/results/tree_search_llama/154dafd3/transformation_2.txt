A program that takes an array of floating point numbers as input, rounds each number to its nearest multiple of 5, and produces the rounded array as output.
The input is a string representation of a list of numbers, with each number separated by commas and having at most 2 decimal places. The output is also a string representing the rounded numbers to their nearest multiples of 5.
Write a function that takes an array as input, rounds each number in the array to its nearest multiple of 5, and returns the rounded array. This function can be implemented using list comprehension and Python's built-in round() function.
