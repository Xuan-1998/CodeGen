The task is to find the closest multiple of 5 for each number in the given array
One possible approach is to break down the problem into smaller sub-problems. For example, we could find the remainder of each number when divided by 5, and then use this remainder to determine which multiple of 5 is closest. This would involve creating a new array with the same length as the original array, but with each element being the corresponding multiple of 5.
