A program that takes an array of floating point numbers as input, rounds each number to its nearest multiple of 5, and produces the rounded array as output.
The input is a list of floating point numbers represented as strings, with each string containing at most 2 decimal places. The output is also a list of strings representing the rounded numbers to their nearest multiples of 5.
Choice 3: Use a dictionary to store the rounded values and their corresponding indices in the original array. Then, iterate through the dictionary to construct the output list of rounded strings. This method is flexible and can be extended to handle more complex rounding rules if needed.
