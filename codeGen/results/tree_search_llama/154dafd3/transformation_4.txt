A program that takes an array of floating point numbers as input, rounds each number to its nearest multiple of 5, and produces the rounded array as output.
The input is a string representation of a list of numbers, with each number separated by commas and having at most 2 decimal places. The output is also a string representing the rounded numbers to their nearest multiples of 5.
Develop an algorithm that converts each number in the array to its scientific notation, rounds the exponent to the nearest multiple of 1, and then converts it back to decimal form. This function can be implemented using Python's built-in round() function and string manipulation techniques.
