This algorithm should be used to solve a problem that involves rounding numbers to the nearest multiple
Choose the nearest multiple of 5 by comparing the difference between each number and its multiples, then return the closest one. For example, if the input is 3.7, round it to 5 (since the difference is smaller than rounding to 0).
