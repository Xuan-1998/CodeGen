A program that takes an array of floating point numbers as input, rounds each number to its nearest multiple of 5, and produces the rounded array as output.
The input is a string representation of a list of numbers, with each number separated by commas and having at most 2 decimal places. The output is also a string representing the rounded numbers to their nearest multiples of 5.
Create a function that iterates over the input array, calculates the difference between each number and its nearest multiple of 5, and then adds or subtracts 5 as necessary to get the correct result. This function can be implemented using a for loop and simple arithmetic operations.
