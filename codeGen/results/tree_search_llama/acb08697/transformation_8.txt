The mathematical problem can be defined as a sequence of n operations on the pile, where each operation adds or removes one stone from the pile. The goal is to find the minimum number of stones in the pile after performing all n operations.
O(1) as we are only using a single variable to store the current number of stones and do not require any data structures with a complexity greater than O(1).
