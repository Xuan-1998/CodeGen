The mathematical problem can be defined as a sequence of n operations on the pile, where each operation adds or removes one stone from the pile. The goal is to find the minimum number of stones in the pile after performing all n operations.
O(1) as we are only using a single variable to store the current number of stones and do not require any data structures with a complexity greater than O(1).
Use a debugger to step through your code and understand where it's going wrong. This can be especially helpful if you're not sure why your solution isn't producing the correct output. Use print statements or the debugger to inspect the values of variables at each step and make sure they're what you expect them to be.
