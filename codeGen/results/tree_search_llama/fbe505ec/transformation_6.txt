Formulate a clear and concise statement of the problem, including the inputs, expected outputs, and constraints. This will help in defining the scope and requirements of the string algorithm solution. For example: 'Given a list of n words, replace all words that have a length greater than 10 characters with a special abbreviation.'
Determine if a sorting algorithm is needed to group similar-length words together before processing them further.
Develop an optimal solution by considering the frequency of words and their lengths. Create a dictionary or hashmap to store the word lengths as keys and the corresponding abbreviations as values. Then, iterate through the input list and replace each long word with its abbreviated form. This approach can be more efficient for large inputs.
