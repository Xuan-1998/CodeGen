Formulate a clear and concise statement of the problem, including the inputs, expected outputs, and constraints. This will help in defining the scope and requirements of the string algorithm solution. For example: 'Given a list of n words, replace all words that have a length greater than 10 characters with a special abbreviation.'
Create a function to iterate over each word in the input list and check its length. If the length is greater than 10, replace the word with the special abbreviation.
Trees: Using a tree data structure (like a Trie) might be overkill for this problem, but it could be an interesting approach if you need to perform complex string operations like searching or validating.
