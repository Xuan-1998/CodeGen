Formulate a clear and concise statement of the problem, including the inputs, expected outputs, and constraints. This will help in defining the scope and requirements of the string algorithm solution. For example: 'Given a list of n words, replace all words that have a length greater than 10 characters with a special abbreviation.'
Develop an approach that involves using regular expressions (regex) to identify words longer than 10 characters and replace them with the abbreviation.
Develop a sorting algorithm that takes into account the length of each word, then iterate through the sorted list and apply the abbreviation rule as needed, ensuring optimal performance and accuracy.
