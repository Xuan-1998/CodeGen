Formulate a clear and concise statement of the problem, including the inputs, expected outputs, and constraints. This will help in defining the scope and requirements of the string algorithm solution. For example: 'Given a list of n words, replace all words that have a length greater than 10 characters with a special abbreviation.'
Create a function to iterate over each word in the input list and check its length. If the length is greater than 10, replace the word with the special abbreviation.
Arrays: This is a suitable choice because you can easily iterate over each element in the array using a for loop, and access each word by its index. You can also use list methods like append or insert to manipulate the strings.
