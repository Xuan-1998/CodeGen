Formulate a clear and concise statement of the problem, including the inputs, expected outputs, and constraints. This will help in defining the scope and requirements of the string algorithm solution. For example: 'Given a list of n words, replace all words that have a length greater than 10 characters with a special abbreviation.'
Develop an approach that involves using regular expressions (regex) to identify words longer than 10 characters and replace them with the abbreviation.
Create a function that iterates through each word in the input list and checks its length using the len() function. If the length is greater than 10, replace the word with the special abbreviation, which can be calculated by concatenating the first and last letter of the word, followed by the number of letters between them.
