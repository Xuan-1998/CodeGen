Formulate a clear and concise statement of the problem, including the inputs, expected outputs, and constraints. This will help in defining the scope and requirements of the string algorithm solution. For example: 'Given a list of n words, replace all words that have a length greater than 10 characters with a special abbreviation.'
Develop an approach that involves using regular expressions (regex) to identify words longer than 10 characters and replace them with the abbreviation.
Implement a regex pattern to match words longer than 10 characters and use the re.sub() function to replace these words with the abbreviation. This approach allows for efficient searching and replacement of strings in the input data.
