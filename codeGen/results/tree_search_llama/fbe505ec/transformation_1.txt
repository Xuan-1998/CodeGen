Formulate a clear and concise statement of the problem, including the inputs, expected outputs, and constraints. This will help in defining the scope and requirements of the string algorithm solution. For example: 'Given a list of n words, replace all words that have a length greater than 10 characters with a special abbreviation.'
Create a function to iterate over each word in the input list and check its length. If the length is greater than 10, replace the word with the special abbreviation.
Linked Lists: A linked list could be used if you want to dynamically add or remove words from the input data. This would require implementing methods for inserting or removing nodes in the linked list.
