Orthus represents the number of heads, Hydra represents the number of tails. The problem can be viewed as finding the pair of values that add up to the total number of heads and tails, with the constraint that the difference between the two values is 2 or more.
One possible approach is to use a two-pointer technique, where one pointer starts at the beginning of the range and moves towards the end, while the other pointer starts at the end of the range and moves towards the beginning. The pointers move based on whether the current sum of heads and tails is greater than or less than the target total.
You could use a greedy approach by always choosing the smaller value (heads or tails) for Orthus, since you need at least 2 difference between them. This would ensure that Hydra is always greater than or equal to half of the total. Then, you would recursively call the function with the remaining heads and tails until you have found the correct combination.
