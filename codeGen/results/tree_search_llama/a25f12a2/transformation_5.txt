There seem to be a direct correlation between the number of heads and the number of Hydra, as well as the number of tails and the number of Orthus. The key is to recognize this connection and find an efficient way to determine the pair that satisfies the given conditions.
Design a dynamic programming approach by creating a 2D array to store the results of sub-problems, where each cell represents the possible combinations of heads and tails for the given total number of heads and tails.
