['Fundamentals' means understanding the core concepts behind the problem. In this case, you need to understand what Orthus and Hydra are, how they relate to heads and tails, and what constraints there are.
Think about how you can use recursion to find the combinations of heads and tails that satisfy the constraints, considering the properties of Orthus and Hydra.
Use dynamic programming to memoize intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
