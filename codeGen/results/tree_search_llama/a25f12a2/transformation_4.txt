There seem to be a direct correlation between the number of heads and the number of Hydra, as well as the number of tails and the number of Orthus. The key is to recognize this connection and find an efficient way to determine the pair that satisfies the given conditions.
Write a recursive function that takes the current total number of heads and tails as input, and recursively calls itself with updated values until it finds a valid solution or determines that there is no solution.
