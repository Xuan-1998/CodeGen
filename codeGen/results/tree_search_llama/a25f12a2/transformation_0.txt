Orthus represents the number of heads, Hydra represents the number of tails. The problem can be viewed as finding the pair of values that add up to the total number of heads and tails, with the constraint that the difference between the two values is 2 or more.
Another approach could be to use a loop that iterates over all possible combinations of Orthus and Hydra values, checking each combination against the constraints until a valid solution is found.
