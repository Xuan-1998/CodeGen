There seem to be a direct correlation between the number of heads and the number of Hydra, as well as the number of tails and the number of Orthus. The key is to recognize this connection and find an efficient way to determine the pair that satisfies the given conditions.
Use a loop to iterate over all possible combinations of heads and tails, checking if each combination satisfies the given conditions.
