Orthus represents the number of heads, Hydra represents the number of tails. The problem can be viewed as finding the pair of values that add up to the total number of heads and tails, with the constraint that the difference between the two values is 2 or more.
One possible approach is to use a two-pointer technique, where one pointer starts at the beginning of the range and moves towards the end, while the other pointer starts at the end of the range and moves towards the beginning. The pointers move based on whether the current sum of heads and tails is greater than or less than the target total.
You could use a two-pointer technique by initializing two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the range. You would then move the pointers based on whether the current sum of heads and tails is greater than or less than the target total, adjusting the values of Orthus and Hydra accordingly until you find the correct combination.
