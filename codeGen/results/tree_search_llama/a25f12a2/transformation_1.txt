Orthus represents the number of heads, Hydra represents the number of tails. The problem can be viewed as finding the pair of values that add up to the total number of heads and tails, with the constraint that the difference between the two values is 2 or more.
A recursive function could also be used to solve this problem. The base case would be when the difference between the number of heads and tails is 2 or more, in which case there is only one possible solution. For larger differences, the function would recursively call itself with smaller values until it reaches the base case.
