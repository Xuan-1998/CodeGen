The problem involves counting mythical creatures based on the given numbers of heads and tails. It's essential to identify how these creatures are related to each other and what constraints must be met for a valid solution.
Think about how the creatures can be paired up based on their head counts. For instance, if there are 2 heads, it's possible that one is an Orthus and the other a Hydra, but if there are 3 or more heads, they must all be from the same creature type (either Orthus or Hydra).
