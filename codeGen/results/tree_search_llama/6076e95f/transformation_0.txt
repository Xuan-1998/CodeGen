The problem statement is: Develop an algorithm that generates a sequence of integers from the first input number to the second input number. The input consists of two integers greater than or equal to 0, where the second integer is greater than or equal to the first. The output is a sequence of integers from the first input number to the second input number, inclusive.
The time complexity could be logarithmic if we use a more efficient algorithm or data structure to generate the sequence.
Recursive Approach: Implement a function that takes two integers as input, and recursively generates the sequence by adding 1 to the current number until it reaches the second integer. This approach can be optimized by using memoization or dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.
