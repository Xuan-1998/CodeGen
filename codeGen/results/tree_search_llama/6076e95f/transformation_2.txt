The problem statement is: Develop an algorithm that generates a sequence of integers from the first input number to the second input number. The input consists of two integers greater than or equal to 0, where the second integer is greater than or equal to the first. The output is a sequence of integers from the first input number to the second input number, inclusive.
The time complexity could be logarithmic if we use a more efficient algorithm or data structure to generate the sequence.
Iterative Approach 2: Implement a function that takes two integers as input and generates the sequence using a while loop that iterates until it reaches the second integer. This approach can also be optimized by using a variable to keep track of the current number being generated.
