The problem statement is: Develop an algorithm that generates a sequence of integers from the first input number to the second input number. The input consists of two integers greater than or equal to 0, where the second integer is greater than or equal to the first. The output is a sequence of integers from the first input number to the second input number, inclusive.
O(log n)
Represent the range of numbers as a list of ranges, where each range is defined by a start and end value. Then, iterate through the ranges to generate the sequence.
Implement the range function from the math module in Python, which returns a sequence of numbers starting from the first argument up to but not including the second argument
