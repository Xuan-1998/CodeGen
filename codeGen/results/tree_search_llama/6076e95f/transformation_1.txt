The problem statement is: Develop an algorithm that generates a sequence of integers from the first input number to the second input number. The input consists of two integers greater than or equal to 0, where the second integer is greater than or equal to the first. The output is a sequence of integers from the first input number to the second input number, inclusive.
The time complexity could be logarithmic if we use a more efficient algorithm or data structure to generate the sequence.
Iterative Approach 1: Use a for loop to iterate from the first integer to the second integer, inclusive, and append each number to a list. This approach is straightforward but may not be efficient for large ranges of numbers.
