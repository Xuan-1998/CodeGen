The problem statement is: Develop an algorithm that generates a sequence of integers from the first input number to the second input number. The input consists of two integers greater than or equal to 0, where the second integer is greater than or equal to the first. The output is a sequence of integers from the first input number to the second input number, inclusive.
O(log n)
Represent the range of numbers as a list of ranges, where each range is defined by a start and end value. Then, iterate through the ranges to generate the sequence.
Instead of generating the entire sequence at once, consider generating the sequence on the fly as needed. This could be useful if the input integers are very large
