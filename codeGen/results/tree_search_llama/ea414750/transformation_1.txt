Try to find all occurrences of 'bear' in the input string and then count the number of pairs where these occurrences overlap with each other.
Use a dictionary to store the starting indices of all occurrences of 'bear' in the input string, allowing for efficient lookups when checking for overlapping pairs.
Implement a regular expression pattern to find all occurrences of 'bear' in the input string. Then, use another loop to count the number of overlapping pairs by checking if the start indices of adjacent matches are consecutive.
