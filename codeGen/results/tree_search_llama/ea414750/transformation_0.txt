Try to find all occurrences of 'bear' in the input string and then count the number of pairs where these occurrences overlap with each other.
Use a dictionary to store the starting indices of all occurrences of 'bear' in the input string, allowing for efficient lookups when checking for overlapping pairs.
Using a sliding window approach, iterate through the input string and for each character, check if the substring starting from that index is equal to 'bear'. If it is, store the starting index in a dictionary.
