This is an integer-based programming problem that involves iterating through a range of numbers and performing arithmetic operations on the digits. The solution will likely involve using loops or recursion to generate the desired output.
Identify the constraints: Determine the range of values for a and b. Are there any specific rules or patterns you've observed in the problem statement? Think about how these constraints can be leveraged to simplify the solution.
