Use a mathematical property of the problem to develop an efficient algorithm. For instance, you could use properties of numbers to identify which numbers satisfy the condition.

Create an iterative solution using a loop to iterate over the numbers in the range [a, b]. Within the loop, use another loop or function to calculate the sum of digits raised to their positions and compare it with the current number. This approach can be optimized by using a set to store unique numbers that satisfy the condition.
