This is an integer-based programming problem that involves iterating through a range of numbers and performing arithmetic operations on the digits. The solution will likely involve using loops or recursion to generate the desired output.
Analyze the mathematical properties of the problem: Consider the operations being performed on the digits (raising them to powers and adding them). Are there any special cases or edge conditions that need to be handled?
Option 2: Digit Sum Algorithm - Use a mathematical property that states the sum of the digits of a number raised to the power of their positions is equal to the number itself. Write an algorithm that uses this property to generate the desired output.
