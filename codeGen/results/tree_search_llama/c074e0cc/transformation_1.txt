Use a mathematical property of the problem to develop an efficient algorithm. For instance, you could use properties of numbers to identify which numbers satisfy the condition.

Use a mathematical property to find all numbers in the range [a, b] that satisfy the condition. For example, you could use the fact that the sum of digits raised to their positions is equal to the number itself for single-digit numbers and then extend this property to multi-digit numbers. This approach can be optimized by using a set or list to store unique numbers that satisfy the condition.
