Use a mathematical property of the problem to develop an efficient algorithm. For instance, you could use properties of numbers to identify which numbers satisfy the condition.
A linked list can be used to keep track of the numbers that satisfy the condition as we iterate through the range [a, b]
You could use a binary search approach to efficiently find the numbers that satisfy the condition within the given range.
