This is an integer-based programming problem that involves iterating through a range of numbers and performing arithmetic operations on the digits. The solution will likely involve using loops or recursion to generate the desired output.
Determine the necessary data structures and algorithms: Based on your understanding of the problem, decide which data structures and algorithms are best suited for solving it. Think about how you can efficiently generate and process the desired output.
Choose to use a brute-force approach by iterating through all numbers in the range [a, b] and checking each number's digit sum against itself. This might be time-consuming but straightforward.
