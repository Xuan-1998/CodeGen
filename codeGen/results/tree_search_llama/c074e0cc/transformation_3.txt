Use a mathematical property of the problem to develop an efficient algorithm. For instance, you could use properties of numbers to identify which numbers satisfy the condition.

Develop a recursive function that checks each number in the range [a, b] and uses a helper function to calculate the sum of digits raised to their positions. This approach can be optimized by returning early if the calculated sum does not match the number.
Develop an algorithm that leverages the property that a number is equal to the sum of its digits raised to their positions if and only if it has no more than one even digit. This can be achieved by iterating over the digits, raising each to its position (0-indexed), and adding them up. If the sum equals the original number, it satisfies the condition.
