This is an integer-based programming problem that involves iterating through a range of numbers and performing arithmetic operations on the digits. The solution will likely involve using loops or recursion to generate the desired output.
Determine the necessary data structures and algorithms: Based on your understanding of the problem, decide which data structures and algorithms are best suited for solving it. Think about how you can efficiently generate and process the desired output.
Optimize the solution by using a recursive function that generates all numbers within the given range and checks their digit sums recursively. This approach can reduce the time complexity but may require more memory for recursion.
