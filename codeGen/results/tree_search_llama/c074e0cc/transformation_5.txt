Use a mathematical property of the problem to develop an efficient algorithm. For instance, you could use properties of numbers to identify which numbers satisfy the condition.

Develop a recursive function that checks each number in the range [a, b] and uses a helper function to calculate the sum of digits raised to their positions. This approach can be optimized by returning early if the calculated sum does not match the number.
Implement an iterative solution that uses a loop to iterate over the range [a, b] and for each number, calculates the sum of digits raised to their positions using a helper function. The algorithm can be optimized by returning early if the calculated sum does not match the number.
