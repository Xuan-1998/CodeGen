Use a mathematical property of the problem to develop an efficient algorithm. For instance, you could use properties of numbers to identify which numbers satisfy the condition.

Develop a recursive function that checks each number in the range [a, b] and uses a helper function to calculate the sum of digits raised to their positions. This approach can be optimized by returning early if the calculated sum does not match the number.
Create a recursive function that calculates the sum of digits raised to their positions for each number in the range [a, b]. The helper function can be used to recursively calculate the sum, with the base case being single-digit numbers. This approach allows you to check each number and return early if the calculated sum does not match the number.
