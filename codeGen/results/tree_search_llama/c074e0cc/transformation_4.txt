This is an integer-based programming problem that involves iterating through a range of numbers and performing arithmetic operations on the digits. The solution will likely involve using loops or recursion to generate the desired output.
Determine the necessary data structures and algorithms: Based on your understanding of the problem, decide which data structures and algorithms are best suited for solving it. Think about how you can efficiently generate and process the desired output.
Harness the power of mathematical properties, such as the fact that the sum of digits in an integer is equal to the number itself only when it's a single-digit number (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ..., 9). Implement this insight to significantly reduce the search space and improve the algorithm's efficiency.
