The relationship between the number of divisors of a number and its prime factorization
Use the concept of prime factorization and the relationship between the number of divisors of a number and its prime factorization to determine the relevant mathematical tools and techniques needed for the solution.
Use the formula for calculating the number of divisors of a perfect square: n = (2 * k + 1)^2. This can help identify numbers having an odd number of factors.
