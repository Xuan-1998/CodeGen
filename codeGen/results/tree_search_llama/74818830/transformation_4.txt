Can we determine how many numbers between 1 and N have an odd number of divisors?
Inclusion-Exclusion Principle: A third option could be to utilize the inclusion-exclusion principle, counting the total number of perfect squares within the given range and subtracting any duplicates that are counted more than once.
Develop a scatter plot illustrating the relationship between the value of N and the count of numbers having an odd number of divisors. This could help identify patterns or trends in the data.
