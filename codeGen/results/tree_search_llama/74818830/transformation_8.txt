The relationship between the number of divisors of a number and its prime factorization
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic (FTA) can be used to decompose numbers into their prime factors, which can then be used to calculate the total count of perfect squares from 1 to N.
Plug in values for different perfect squares, such as 4, 9, and 16, into the solution to ensure it produces the correct counts. For example, 4 has an even number of divisors (2), while 9 and 16 both have an odd number of divisors (3).
