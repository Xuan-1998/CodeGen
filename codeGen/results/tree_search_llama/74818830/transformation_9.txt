The relationship between the number of divisors of a number and its prime factorization
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic (FTA) can be used to decompose numbers into their prime factors, which can then be used to calculate the total count of perfect squares from 1 to N.
Test the solution by checking if the count remains constant when N is increased or decreased by a small value, such as 1. This can help identify any edge cases or bounds that need to be handled.
