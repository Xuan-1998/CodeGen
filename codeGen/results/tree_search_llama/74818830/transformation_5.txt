The relationship between the number of divisors of a number and its prime factorization
Use the concept of prime factorization and the relationship between the number of divisors of a number and its prime factorization to determine the relevant mathematical tools and techniques needed for the solution.
The concept of prime factorization and its relationship to the number of divisors of a number can be used to create an equation or model that allows for efficient counting. For example, consider the fact that a perfect square has only even exponents in its prime factorization.
