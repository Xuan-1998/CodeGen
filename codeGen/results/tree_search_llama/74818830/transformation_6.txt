The relationship between the number of divisors of a number and its prime factorization
Use the concept of prime factorization and the relationship between the number of divisors of a number and its prime factorization to determine the relevant mathematical tools and techniques needed for the solution.
Use Euler's totient function (φ(n)) to calculate the number of positive integers up to n that are relatively prime to n. Since φ(n) is multiplicative and φ(p^k) = p^(k-1)*(p-1), this can be applied to perfect squares to determine their factor count.
