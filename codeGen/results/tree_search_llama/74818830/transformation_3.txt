Can we determine how many numbers between 1 and N have an odd number of divisors?
Inclusion-Exclusion Principle: A third option could be to utilize the inclusion-exclusion principle, counting the total number of perfect squares within the given range and subtracting any duplicates that are counted more than once.
Create a bar chart showing the distribution of numbers with an odd number of divisors within the range 1 to N. The x-axis would represent the value of N, and the y-axis would show the count of such numbers.
