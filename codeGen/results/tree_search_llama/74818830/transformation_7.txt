The relationship between the number of divisors of a number and its prime factorization
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic (FTA) can be used to decompose numbers into their prime factors, which can then be used to calculate the total count of perfect squares from 1 to N.
Check if the number of divisors of a number is odd for each perfect square from 1 to N. This can be done by calculating the prime factorization of the perfect square using FTA and counting the occurrences of each prime factor. Then, check if this count is odd. If it is, increment a counter variable. Finally, print the value of the counter variable as the total count of numbers from 1 to N having an odd number of factors.
