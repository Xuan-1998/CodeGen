Define the problem statement or objective: You want to achieve a string that contains all unique characters from the input string Str, maintaining their original order. This means you'll need to remove duplicate characters while preserving the sequence.
Use a dictionary to store unique characters
Use a set to store unique characters and iterate through the input string. For each character, check if it's not in the set; if not, add it to the set. Then, convert the set back to a list and sort it based on its original order (use a dictionary or a list with indices). Finally, join the sorted list into a string and return it.
