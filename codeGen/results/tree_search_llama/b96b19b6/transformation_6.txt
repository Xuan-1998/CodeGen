Define the problem statement or objective: You want to achieve a string that contains all unique characters from the input string Str, maintaining their original order. This means you'll need to remove duplicate characters while preserving the sequence.
Use a dictionary to store unique characters
Use a sliding window approach with two pointers (i and j) to maintain the order of unique characters. Initialize i = 0 and j = 0. Iterate through the input string, and when a character is not in the dictionary, add it and increment j. If a character is already in the dictionary, update the value at the corresponding index with the current character and increment i. Finally, return the substring from i to j.
