Determine if there's any specific requirement in terms of the output string length or performance constraints, and develop an approach accordingly.
Utilize a HashSet data structure to store unique characters from the string. Iterate through the input string, adding each character to the set. This approach provides efficient lookup and insertion operations with an average time complexity of O(1).
