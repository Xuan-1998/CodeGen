Analyze the problem statement and identify the key challenge or objective: The key challenge is to efficiently remove duplicate characters from a given string while preserving the original order of characters.
\
Use a two-pointer technique to keep track of the last seen character and its index in the input string. Iterate through the string once, keeping track of the last seen character and its index, and construct the resulting string with unique characters. This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and uses space constant.
