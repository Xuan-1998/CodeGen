Define the problem statement or objective: You want to achieve a string that contains all unique characters from the input string Str, maintaining their original order. This means you'll need to remove duplicate characters while preserving the sequence.
Use a dictionary to store unique characters
Use a two-pointer approach similar to the previous choice, but instead of using a dictionary, use an array to store unique characters. Initialize the array with all possible ASCII values set to 0, then iterate through the input string. For each character, check its ASCII value in the array; if it's not 0, update the corresponding index and increment i. Finally, convert the array back into a string and return it.
