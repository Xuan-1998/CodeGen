Define the problem statement or objective: Your goal is to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with only the unique characters from the original string, in the same order they appeared.
O(n), O(min(n, m)) where n is the length of the string and m is the size of the character set. This choice assumes that the time complexity depends on the number of unique characters in the input string, and the space complexity depends on the maximum possible character set.
