Analyze the problem statement and identify the key challenge or objective: The key challenge is to efficiently remove duplicate characters from a given string while preserving the original order of characters.
\
Use a set to keep track of unique characters in the string, then iterate through the original string again to construct the result. This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and uses space proportional to the size of the input string.
