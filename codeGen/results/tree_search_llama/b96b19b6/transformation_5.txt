Define the problem statement or objective: You aim to develop an algorithm that reads through a given string Str, identifies duplicate characters, and constructs a resulting string containing these unique characters in their original sequence.
['Iterate through the input string, using two pointers to maintain a sliding window of unique characters. Update the pointers accordingly as new characters are encountered.', 'Ensure the window is always sorted and updated correctly at each step.']
