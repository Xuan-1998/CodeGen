Define the problem statement or objective: Your goal is to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with only the unique characters from the original string, in the same order they appeared.
O(n + m), O(m) where m is the size of the character set. This choice assumes that the time complexity depends on both the length of the input string and the maximum possible number of unique characters, and the space complexity is proportional to the size of the character set.
