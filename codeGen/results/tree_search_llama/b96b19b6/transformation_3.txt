Define the problem statement or objective: Your goal is to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with only the unique characters from the original string, in the same order they appeared.
O(n log n) due to sorting, O(1) because we're only using a constant amount of space. This choice assumes that the time complexity is dominated by the sorting operation, and the space complexity is constant.
