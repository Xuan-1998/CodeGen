Analyze the problem statement and identify the key challenge or objective: The key challenge is to efficiently remove duplicate characters from a given string while preserving the original order of characters.
\
Implement a frequency map (e.g., a hash table or dictionary) that counts the occurrences of each character in the input string. Then, iterate through the frequency map to construct the resulting string with unique characters, maintaining the original order. This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and uses space proportional to the size of the alphabet.
