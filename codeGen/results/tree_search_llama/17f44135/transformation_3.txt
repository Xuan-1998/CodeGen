Implement a greedy algorithm that always selects the problem with the smallest difficulty that does not exceed the current skill level. Start from the leftmost and rightmost problems, and move towards the center of the list until no more problems can be solved. The maximum number of problems that can be solved is the total number of problems minus the number of problems that were not solved.
Search for the target value using Binary Search: Implement a binary search algorithm to find the first problem in the sorted list that does not exceed the current skill level. This choice is suitable when the input list is large and the skill level is high, as it can significantly reduce the number of comparisons needed.
