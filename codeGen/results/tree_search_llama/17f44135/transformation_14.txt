Begin by initializing a variable to keep track of the maximum number of problems that can be solved. Then, iterate through the list of problems in ascending order. For each problem, check if its difficulty is less than or equal to k. If it is, increment the counter and update the maximum count if necessary. Repeat this process until no more problems can be solved, and return the final count.
