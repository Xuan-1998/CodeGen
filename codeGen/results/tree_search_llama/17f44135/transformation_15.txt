: Consider the problems as a sorted list of difficulties, then you can apply binary search to find the maximum number of problems that can be solved within the skill level k. This approach provides a more robust solution by allowing for efficient searching and sorting of the problems.
Pseudocode or actual code implementation of the algorithm, following the outlined steps
