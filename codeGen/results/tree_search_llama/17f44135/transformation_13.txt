Start by sorting the list of problems in descending order of difficulty. Then, initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum number of problems that can be solved. Iterate through the sorted list, and for each problem, check if its difficulty is less than or equal to k. If it is, increment the counter and update the maximum count if necessary. Finally, return the maximum count.
