Implement a greedy algorithm that always selects the problem with the smallest difficulty that does not exceed the current skill level. Start from the leftmost and rightmost problems, and move towards the center of the list until no more problems can be solved. The maximum number of problems that can be solved is the total number of problems minus the number of problems that were not solved.
