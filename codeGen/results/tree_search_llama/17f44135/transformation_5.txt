: Determine whether the difficulty level k is a fixed integer or varies throughout the problems. If it's fixed, then you can solve the problems in an optimal manner by selecting either the leftmost or rightmost problem that has a difficulty less than or equal to k. This approach allows for an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n).
If k is fixed, calculate the maximum difficulty level that can be solved. This will depend on whether the difficulties are increasing or decreasing.
