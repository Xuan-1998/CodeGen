Use a two-pointer approach to find the maximum number of problems that can be solved. Initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the list. Then, repeatedly move the pointer with the smaller value towards the other pointer until they meet. The maximum number of problems that can be solved is equal to the sum of the indices where the pointers cross each other.
Sort the list in descending order using 
Create a flag variable 'has_duplicates' and set it to False at the beginning of your function, then iterate through the list and check if there are any duplicate values. If you find one, set 'has_duplicates' to True. Finally, return 'has_duplicates'.
