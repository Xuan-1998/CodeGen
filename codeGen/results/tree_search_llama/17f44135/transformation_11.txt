Use a two-pointer approach to find the maximum number of problems that can be solved. Initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the list. Then, repeatedly move the pointer with the smaller value towards the other pointer until they meet. The maximum number of problems that can be solved is equal to the sum of the indices where the pointers cross each other.
Sort the list in descending order using 
Use Python's built-in function len() and compare it with 0. If the length is equal to 0, return True because an empty list has no duplicates.
