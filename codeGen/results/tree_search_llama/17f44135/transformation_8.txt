Use a sliding window approach to find the maximum number of problems that can be solved. Initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the list. Then, repeatedly move the pointer with the smaller value towards the other pointer until they meet or until no more problems can be solved. The maximum number of problems that can be solved is equal to the sum of the indices where the pointers cross each other.
Create a new list by reversing the order of the elements
