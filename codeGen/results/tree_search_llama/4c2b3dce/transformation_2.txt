Define a recursive relation between the problems by checking if 'AB' appears at the beginning of the string and recursively solving the remaining part, and similarly for 'BA'.
Recursively check if the string starts with 'AB' or 'BA', and if it does, recursively solve the remaining part. Store the result of each recursive call to avoid redundant computation.
