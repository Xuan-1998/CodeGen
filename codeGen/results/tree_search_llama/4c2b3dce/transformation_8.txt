Divide the problem into smaller subproblems by iterating over the string s to find all possible substrings of length 2 that are either 'AB' or 'BA'.
Create a recursive function that takes two parameters: the current substring of s and the target substring (either 'AB' or 'BA'). The function returns True if the current substring contains the target substring, False otherwise. The base case is when the length of the current substring is less than 2.
Iterative Solution: Use a loop to iterate over the string s and check each possible substring of length 2 for being either 'AB' or 'BA'. Store the results in a variable that keeps track of whether the substrings are found.
