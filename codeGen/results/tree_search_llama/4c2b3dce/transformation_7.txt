Identify overlapping subproblems by noting that once we find one instance of 'AB' or 'BA', we can safely ignore the same substrings in the remaining part of the string to avoid redundant computation.
Employ a combination of both memoization and tabulation by using a dictionary to store the results for substrings and a table to keep track of the positions where 'AB' or 'BA' appear
