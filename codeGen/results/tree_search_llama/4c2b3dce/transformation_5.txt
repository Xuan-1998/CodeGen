Identify overlapping subproblems by noting that once we find one instance of 'AB' or 'BA', we can safely ignore the same substrings in the remaining part of the string to avoid redundant computation.
Use a dictionary-based memoization approach where you store the results for substrings that have been checked and return the result if it's already present in the dictionary.
