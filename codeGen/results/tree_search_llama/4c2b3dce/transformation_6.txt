Identify overlapping subproblems by noting that once we find one instance of 'AB' or 'BA', we can safely ignore the same substrings in the remaining part of the string to avoid redundant computation.
Implement a tabulation approach by creating a 2D table where each cell represents whether 'AB' or 'BA' is present at that position, and use this to avoid redundant computation
