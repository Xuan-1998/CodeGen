Define a recursive relation between the problems by checking if 'AB' appears at the beginning of the string and recursively solving the remaining part, and similarly for 'BA'.
Tabulate the results for all possible substrings of the input string, and then use these precomputed values to solve the problem. This can be done using a 2D array or a list of lists.
