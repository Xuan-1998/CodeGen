Define a recursive relation between the problems by checking if 'AB' appears at the beginning of the string and recursively solving the remaining part, and similarly for 'BA'.
Use a dictionary to store previously computed solutions for substrings of the input string, and update this dictionary as you iterate through the string. This allows you to quickly check if a substring has been seen before.
