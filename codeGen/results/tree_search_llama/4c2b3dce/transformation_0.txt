Divide the problem into smaller subproblems by iterating over the string s to find all possible substrings of length 2 that are either 'AB' or 'BA'.
Define a recursive function that takes three parameters: the current position in s, the target substring (either 'AB' or 'BA'), and a boolean indicating whether the target substring has been found so far. The function returns True if the target substring has been found, False otherwise. The base case is when the current position is greater than the length of s.
