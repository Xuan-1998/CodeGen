Divide the problem into smaller subproblems by iterating over the string s to find all possible substrings of length 2 that are either 'AB' or 'BA'.
Create a recursive function that takes two parameters: the starting index of the current window in s and the target substring (either 'AB' or 'BA'). The function returns True if the current window contains the target substring, False otherwise. The base case is when the ending index of the current window exceeds the length of s.
