"{\"statement\": \"Task: Implement a function called `stringify` that takes a singly linked list and returns a string representation of the list. The string representation of the list starts with the value of the current node, followed by an arrow and the rest of the list. The end of the string representation of a list must always end with `null`.\\n\\nInput: The input is a singly linked list, which is a data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains a non-negative integer value and a reference to the next node. The input arrives from standard input.\\n\\nOutput: The output is a string representation of the linked list, which is a sequence of non-negative integer values separated by arrows. The end of the string representation of a list must always end with `null`.\\n\\nConstraints: The linked list may only contain non-negative integer values.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Data structures', 'Complete search']\", \"difficulties\": \"EASY\", \"source\": \"codewars\", \"url\": \"https://www.codewars.com/kata/582c297e56373f0426000098\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": [null], \"output\": [\"None\"]}]}"
