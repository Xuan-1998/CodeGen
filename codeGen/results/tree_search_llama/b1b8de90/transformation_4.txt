A mathematical equation for the number of permutations that are sorted by this recursive sorting function can be written as: Î£(1 <= i <= n) (n - i + 1)
Formulate an optimization problem to find the permutation that minimizes/maximizes some cost function and use linear programming or dynamic programming to solve it
