Since the problem involves a recursive sorting function, consider using combinatorial mathematics to develop an algorithm that counts the number of permutations that satisfy the condition. This could involve applying mathematical formulas or theorems related to permutations, combinations, and recursion.
Design an algorithm that utilizes dynamic programming principles to count the number of permutations satisfying the condition. Implement this algorithm in Python and visualize the results using a library like pandas and matplotlib.
