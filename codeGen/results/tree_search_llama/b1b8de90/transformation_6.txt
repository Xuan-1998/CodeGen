Since the problem involves a recursive sorting function, consider using combinatorial mathematics to develop an algorithm that counts the number of permutations that satisfy the condition. This could involve applying mathematical formulas or theorems related to permutations, combinations, and recursion.
Use a programming language like Haskell or Scala, which have strong type systems and support for functional programming, to implement a recursive function that counts the number of permutations satisfying the condition. Visualize the results using a library like Plotly or Bokeh.
