Since the problem involves a recursive sorting function, consider using combinatorial mathematics to develop an algorithm that counts the number of permutations that satisfy the condition. This could involve applying mathematical formulas or theorems related to permutations, combinations, and recursion.
Create a visual representation using a graphing library such as matplotlib in Python to illustrate the relationship between the permutation and the sorted result. This could involve plotting the permutation against the sorted result to identify patterns or correlations.
