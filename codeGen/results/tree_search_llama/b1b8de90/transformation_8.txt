Write a set of unit tests using a testing framework like Python's unittest module. Create test cases that cover various scenarios, such as different input sizes, edge cases (e.g., n = 1), and error handling. This approach ensures your solution is thoroughly tested and provides a more structured way to verify the correctness of the code.
