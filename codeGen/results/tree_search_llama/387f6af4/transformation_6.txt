Identify if the problem requires flipping bits (1s become 0s and vice versa).
Flipping each bit (1s become 0s and vice versa) in the binary representation of N
Write a test function that takes an integer as input and returns its complement. You can use this function to verify the correctness of your main solution. Then, call this test function with different test cases (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 8), and compare the results to the expected outputs.
