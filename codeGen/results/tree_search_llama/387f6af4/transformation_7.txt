Identify if the problem requires flipping bits (1s become 0s and vice versa).
Flipping each bit (1s become 0s and vice versa) in the binary representation of N
Implement a loop that iterates over the binary representation of N and flips each bit. For example, you can use a while loop to iterate until N becomes 0. Then, convert this flipped binary number back to decimal and check if it's the correct complement.
