The BFS traversal method starts at the root node and explores all of its neighboring nodes before moving to the next level until all nodes have been visited.
Enqueue the starting node into the queue by setting the initial value of a variable.
Use a loop to repeatedly divide n by p as long as n is greater than or equal to p, incrementing the count each time. The count will be the desired exponent.
