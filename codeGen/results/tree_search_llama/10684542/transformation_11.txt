The BFS traversal method starts at the root node and explores all of its neighboring nodes before moving to the next level until all nodes have been visited.
Enqueue the starting node into the queue by setting the initial value of a variable.
Perform a series of divisions and modulus operations until p no longer divides into n. The number of divisions performed will be the desired exponent.
