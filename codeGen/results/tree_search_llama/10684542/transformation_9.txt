The BFS traversal method starts at the root node and explores all of its neighboring nodes before moving to the next level until all nodes have been visited.
Enqueue the starting node into the queue by setting the initial value of a variable.
To find the exponent, calculate the logarithm of n to the base p and then use the ceil function to round up to the nearest integer.
