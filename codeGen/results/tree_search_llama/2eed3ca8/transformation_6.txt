The task can be tackled by employing string matching techniques like the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm or the Boyer-Moore algorithm to find any repeated patterns in the sequence.
Hashing could be utilized to efficiently search and find repeated patterns
Implement a robot simulation using the KMP algorithm to match sequences of moves.
