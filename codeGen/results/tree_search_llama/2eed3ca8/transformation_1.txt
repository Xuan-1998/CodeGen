The task can be tackled by employing string matching techniques like the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm or the Boyer-Moore algorithm to find any repeated patterns in the sequence.
The Rabin-Karp algorithm could be used for string matching
Utilize the Boyer-Moore algorithm, which also employs preprocessing to construct a bad character table. This approach would involve creating another data structure like an array to store the information about the characters in the pattern that don't match the robot's moves string. The Boyer-Moore algorithm has a time complexity of O(n+m), similar to the KMP algorithm. Data structures would include arrays or lists for the bad character table and the longest proper prefix/suffix information.
