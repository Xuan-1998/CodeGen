The task can be tackled by employing string matching techniques like the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm or the Boyer-Moore algorithm to find any repeated patterns in the sequence.
The Rabin-Karp algorithm could be used for string matching
Apply the Rabin-Karp algorithm, which uses hashing to find repeated patterns in the robot's moves string. This approach would involve creating a hash table data structure to store the hash values of the substrings of the robot's moves string. The Rabin-Karp algorithm has a time complexity of O(n+m) on average, although it can be as high as O(n*m) in worst-case scenarios. Data structures would include arrays or lists for storing the hash values and checking for matches.
