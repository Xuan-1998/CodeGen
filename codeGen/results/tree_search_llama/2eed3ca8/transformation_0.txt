The task can be tackled by employing string matching techniques like the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm or the Boyer-Moore algorithm to find any repeated patterns in the sequence.
The Rabin-Karp algorithm could be used for string matching
Implement the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm using a preprocessing step to construct the failure function. This would involve creating a data structure like an array to store the longest proper prefix that is also a suffix for each substring of the robot's moves string. The KMP algorithm has a time complexity of O(n+m), where n is the length of the robot's moves string and m is the length of the pattern. Data structures would include arrays or lists to store the failure function values and the longest proper prefix/suffix information.
