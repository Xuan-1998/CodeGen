The task involves analyzing a string of commands that direct the robot's movements, determining whether these movements form a closed loop or not.
The initial position and final position of the robot can be considered as key components
Create test cases using Python's built-in string manipulation functions and conditional statements to compare the initial and final positions of the robot. This can help identify edge cases such as a single step forward or a circular loop.
