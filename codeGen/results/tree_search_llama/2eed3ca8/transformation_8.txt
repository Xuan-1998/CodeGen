The task can be tackled by employing string matching techniques like the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm or the Boyer-Moore algorithm to find any repeated patterns in the sequence.
Hashing could be utilized to efficiently search and find repeated patterns
Create a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python that integrates the algorithm with a visual representation of the robot's movements.
