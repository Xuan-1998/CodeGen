The task involves analyzing a string of commands that direct the robot's movements, determining whether these movements form a closed loop or not.
'Forward' and 'Turn' commands can be categorized into separate patterns for analysis
Develop a state machine-based solution that keeps track of the robot's position and direction after each move. The state machine can be designed to transition between different states based on the 'Forward' and 'Turn' commands. This approach has an average time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
