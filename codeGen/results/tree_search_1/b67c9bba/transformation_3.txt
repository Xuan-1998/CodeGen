Let f(i) represent the expected number of shuffles needed to sort the first i elements. The subproblem is to find f(i) given that f(i-1) is known.
Use a one-dimensional array 'dp' where dp[i] stores the expected number of shuffles needed to sort the first i numbers. Initialize the base case dp[1] = 0 since a single element is always sorted.
dp[i] = 1 + sum(dp[j]) / i for j in range(1, i) if the j-th element is not in the correct position
