For a given sequence length n, the subproblem is to calculate the expected shuffles required to sort a subsequence of length k, where 1 <= k <= n.
A one-dimensional list, where dp[i] represents the expected shuffles required to sort a subsequence of length i, and update it iteratively with the number of elements out of place.
