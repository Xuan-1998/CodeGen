Let f(i) represent the expected number of shuffles needed to sort the first i elements. The subproblem is to find f(i) given that f(i-1) is known.
Create a two-dimensional array 'dp_table' where dp_table[i][j] represents the expected number of shuffles needed to sort a subsequence of length i with j elements already in the correct position. Set dp_table[1][1] = 0, as a single element is trivially in the correct position.
