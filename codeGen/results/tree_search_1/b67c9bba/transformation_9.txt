For a given sequence length n, the subproblem is to calculate the expected shuffles required to sort a subsequence of length k, where 1 <= k <= n.
A two-dimensional list, where dp[i][j] represents the expected shuffles required to sort a subsequence of length i having j elements out of place.
Use a bottom-up approach to fill a two-dimensional dp table, iterating over the subsequences' lengths from 1 to n and for each length k, iterating over the count of out-of-place elements from 0 to k-1.
