For a given sequence length n, the subproblem is to calculate the expected shuffles required to sort a subsequence of length k, where 1 <= k <= n.
A two-dimensional list, where dp[i][j] represents the expected shuffles required to sort a subsequence of length i having j elements out of place.
Employ a top-down approach with memoization by defining a recursive function that computes the expected shuffles for a subsequence of length k with j elements out of place, caching the results to avoid redundant calculations.
