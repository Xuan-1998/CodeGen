Consider a Boolean table is_sorted[i] where each entry indicates whether the element at index i is in its sorted position. The subproblem is to calculate the expected shuffles required considering the current state of the is_sorted array.
E(n) = (n/E(n-1)) + 1, where E(n) is the expected number of shuffles for an n-element array and all elements are not sorted.
