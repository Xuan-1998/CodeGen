Consider a Boolean table is_sorted[i] where each entry indicates whether the element at index i is in its sorted position. The subproblem is to calculate the expected shuffles required considering the current state of the is_sorted array.
E(n, k) = 1 + (1/k) * E(n, k - 1) + ((k - 1)/k) * E(n - 1, k - 1), where E(n, k) is the expected number of shuffles for an array of size n with k elements not in their sorted position.
