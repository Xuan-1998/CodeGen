Consider the scenario where the sequence has 'm' elements out of 'n' that are not in their correct position. The subproblem is to find the expected number of shuffles to sort these 'm' elements.
 - For a sequence with no elements out of place (m=0), initialize the expected shuffles as 0. For all other m, it's yet to be calculated.
