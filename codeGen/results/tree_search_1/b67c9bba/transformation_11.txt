For a given sequence length n, the subproblem is to calculate the expected shuffles required to sort a subsequence of length k, where 1 <= k <= n.
A two-dimensional list, where dp[i][j] represents the expected shuffles required to sort a subsequence of length i having j elements out of place.
Apply a bottom-up approach with a one-dimensional dp list, iteratively updating the expected shuffles for subsequences of increasing lengths while keeping track of in-place and out-of-place elements.
