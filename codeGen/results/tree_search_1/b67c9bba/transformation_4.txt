Let f(i) represent the expected number of shuffles needed to sort the first i elements. The subproblem is to find f(i) given that f(i-1) is known.
Use a one-dimensional array 'dp' where dp[i] stores the expected number of shuffles needed to sort the first i numbers. Initialize the base case dp[1] = 0 since a single element is always sorted.
dp[i] = 1 + (dp[i - 1] * i) / (i - 1) because each shuffle moves the i-th element out of place with a probability of 1/(i-1)
