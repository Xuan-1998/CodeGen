Let dp[i][j] be the number of valid sequences ending with the element j after considering the first i sets.
A two-dimensional list 'dp', where dp[i][j] holds the number of valid sequences ending with element j after considering the first i sets.
Sum all dp[N][j] for all possible j in the last set to get the total number of valid sequences.
