Let dp[i][j] be the number of valid sequences ending with the element j after considering the first i sets.
A two-dimensional list 'dp', where dp[i][j] holds the number of valid sequences ending with element j after considering the first i sets.
Add dp[N][j] for each distinct element j in the N-th set, ensuring that the element before j in the sequence is not the same as j.
