Let dp[i][j] be the number of valid sequences using the first i sets where the sequence ends with an integer j.
Create a 1D list dp, where each element dp[j] represents the number of valid sequences using all sets considered so far that end with the integer j. Reuse this list for each set by keeping track of the counts from the previous set.
