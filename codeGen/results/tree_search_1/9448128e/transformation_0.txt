Let dp[i][j] be the number of valid sequences using the first i sets where the sequence ends with an integer j.
Implement a dictionary of dictionaries for memoization, where the outer dictionary is indexed by the set number i and the inner dictionary by the last element j of the sequence, with default values of zero.
