For each day i and for each possible water level j, the subproblem is to find the minimum number of marks below the water level up to day i, given that the water level on day i is at height j.
Base case for marks mi: For any day i, if there are mi marks above the water level, then the minimum number of marks below the water level is 0, assuming the water level is at mi+1.
