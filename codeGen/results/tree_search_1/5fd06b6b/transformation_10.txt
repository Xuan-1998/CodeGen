For each day i, the subproblem is to find the minimum number of marks below the water level up to that day, considering the marks made on previous days.
Use a list named 'dp' where dp[i] represents the minimum sum of marks strictly below the water level up to day i.
Use a variable to keep track of the running minimum sum of marks below the water level and update it as you iterate through the days, using the (i - mi) difference for the current day.
