For each day i, the subproblem is to find the minimum number of marks below the water level up to that day, considering the marks made on previous days.
Use a list named 'dp' where dp[i] represents the minimum sum of marks strictly below the water level up to day i.
For each day i, find the minimum number of marks below the water level among all days up to day i by checking the minimum value of dp from previous days and add (i - mi) to it.
