For each day i, the subproblem is to find the minimum number of marks below the water level up to that day, considering the marks made on previous days.
Use a list named 'dp' where dp[i] represents the minimum sum of marks strictly below the water level up to day i.
Iterate through the days and for each day, calculate dp[i] as dp[i-1] plus the difference between the current day's index (i) and the current day's mark (mi).
