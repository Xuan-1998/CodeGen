"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given the number of days n and the number of marks strictly above the water level on each day mi, find the minimum possible sum of the number of marks strictly below the water level among all days. Arkady observes a river for n consecutive days and makes a mark on the side of the channel at the height of the water level. If a mark coincides with a mark made before, no new mark is created.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single positive integer n, which represents the number of days (1 \\u2264 n \\u2264 105). The second line contains n space-separated integers m1, m2, ..., mn, which represent the number of marks strictly above the water on each day (0 \\u2264 mi < i). The input arrives from standard input.\\n\\nOutput: Output one single integer, which represents the minimum possible sum of the number of marks strictly below the water level among all days.\\n\\nConstraints: The number of marks strictly above the water level on each day mi is between 0 and i-1.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Dynamic programming', 'Data structures', 'Greedy algorithms']\", \"difficulties\": \"MEDIUM_HARD\", \"source\": \"codeforces\", \"url\": \"https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/957/D\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"3\\n0 1 1\\n\", \"output\": \"0\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"4\\n0 0 1 2\\n\", \"output\": \"0\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"2\\n0 0\\n\", \"output\": \"0\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"4\\n0 1 1 0\\n\", \"output\": \"1\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"3\\n0 1 0\\n\", \"output\": \"1\\n\"}]}"
