Let dp[i][j] be the minimum time needed to eat j candies when Tanya is at box i, regardless of the color of the last candy eaten.
dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-r_i] + 1) for boxes to the left of i and dp[i][j] = min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-r_i] + 1) for boxes to the right of i, while ensuring the color constraint is not violated
