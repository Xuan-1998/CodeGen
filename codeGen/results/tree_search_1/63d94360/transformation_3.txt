Let dp[i] represent the number of ways Messi can receive the ball after exactly i passes, considering all the possible players who could have passed to him last.
dp[i] = (dp[i-1] * (K-2) + dp[i-2] * (K-1)) % 1000000007  # This accounts for the last two passes, ensuring that Messi doesn't receive the ball two times in a row.
