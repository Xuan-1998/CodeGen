Let dp[i][j] represent the number of ways to pass the ball i times such that Messi (player 0) receives the ball on the ith pass, and the last pass was made by player j.
Use a 2D list with dimensions (N+1) x (K+1), where each element dp[i][j] is initialized to 0
return dp[N][0] modulo 1000000007 as the final answer since it represents the number of ways Messi can receive the ball after exactly N passes
