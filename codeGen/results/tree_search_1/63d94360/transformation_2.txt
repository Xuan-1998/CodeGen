Let dp[i] represent the number of ways Messi can receive the ball after exactly i passes, considering all the possible players who could have passed to him last.
dp[i] = (dp[i-1] * (K-1)) % 1000000007  # Here, dp[i-1] is the number of ways to pass the ball i-1 times, and (K-1) accounts for the fact that the last pass can come from any of the K-1 other players.
