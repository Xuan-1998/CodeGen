For each cell (i, j), define a subproblem as the number of square submatrices that end at (i, j) and have ones on and above their main diagonal.
For cell (i, j), if A[i][j] is 1 then dp[i][j] = 1 + sum(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(j, m)). This sums up all the possible squares that can be formed from row i-1 to the current row i, ending at column j.
