For each possible size k (1 to min(N, M)), define a subproblem as counting the number of k x k square submatrices that have ones on and above their main diagonal.
Fill in the table in a bottom-up manner by iterating over the rows and columns from the end towards the beginning, updating the count for each square submatrix size possible at each cell
