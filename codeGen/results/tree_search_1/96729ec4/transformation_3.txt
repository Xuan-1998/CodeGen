For each cell (i, j), define a subproblem as the size of the largest square submatrix with bottom-right corner at (i, j) that has ones on and above its main diagonal.
Use a 2D list 'dp' where dp[i][j] will hold the size of the largest square submatrix ending at cell (i, j).
Iterate over each cell (i, j) in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom). At each cell, if it's possible to form a square submatrix ending at that cell, add the size of that square to the total count.
