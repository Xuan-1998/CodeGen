For each cell (i, j) in the matrix, count the number of square submatrices that have their bottom-right corner at (i, j) and have ones on and above the main diagonal.
Create a 2D array 'dp' with the same dimensions as the input matrix, where dp[i][j] will represent the size of the largest square submatrix ending at cell (i, j) with ones on and above the main diagonal.
Begin from the bottom-right corner of the matrix and proceed towards the top-left corner, addressing the subproblems for each cell in reverse order.
