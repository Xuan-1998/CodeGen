For each cell (i, j), define a subproblem as the size of the largest square submatrix with bottom-right corner at (i, j) that has ones on and above its main diagonal.
Leverage a dictionary with keys as tuples (i, j) to serve as a more flexible memoization structure, where each key corresponds to a subproblem.
