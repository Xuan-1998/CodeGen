Construct a sequence of actions that will combine the initial monsters' weights to match the final queue's weights, ensuring that each action is the best possible move to reduce the size of the initial queue while achieving the final queue's configuration.
Use a stack to simulate the eating process. Push the weights of the initial queue to the stack and pop when the top of the stack matches the current weight in the final queue. Keep track of the eating order and ensure the stack's top always corresponds to the current monster that needs to match the final queue.
