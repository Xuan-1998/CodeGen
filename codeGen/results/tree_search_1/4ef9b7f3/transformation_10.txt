Find the optimal sequence of monsters eating each other to arrive at the final queue configuration. The structure of the solution is a sequence of moves specifying which monster eats the one in front or behind it.
Choose the monster in the initial queue that matches the weight of the first monster in the final queue and check if it can consume adjacent monsters to reach that weight
Choice 3: Optimize the greedy approach by using a two-pointer technique, one starting at the beginning of the initial queue and the other at the end, merging towards the center as monsters eat each other to match the weights in the final queue. This would decrease the time complexity to O(n) since each monster is visited at most twice, and the space complexity remains O(n) to maintain the list of operations and the transformed queue.
