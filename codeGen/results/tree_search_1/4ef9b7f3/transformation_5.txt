Construct a sequence of actions that will combine the initial monsters' weights to match the final queue's weights, ensuring that each action is the best possible move to reduce the size of the initial queue while achieving the final queue's configuration.
Create a pointer for the initial and final queues. Compare the sum of consecutive weights from the start or end of the initial queue to the weight in the final queue. If a match is found, record the eating order, and move the pointers accordingly.
