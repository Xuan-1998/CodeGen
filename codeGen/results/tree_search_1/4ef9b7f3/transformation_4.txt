Determine the order of 'eating' events that will transform the initial queue into the final queue by making the most efficient choice at each step, considering the weights of the monsters and the desired final weights.
Construct a mapping from the final queue monsters back to the initial queue by summing continuous segments of the initial queue. If at each step, the greedy choice of the largest possible initial segment that matches the weight of the final monster leads to a valid mapping for all final queue monsters, the solution is valid.
