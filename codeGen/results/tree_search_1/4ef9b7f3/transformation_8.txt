Find the optimal sequence of monsters eating each other to arrive at the final queue configuration. The structure of the solution is a sequence of moves specifying which monster eats the one in front or behind it.
Choose the monster in the initial queue that matches the weight of the first monster in the final queue and check if it can consume adjacent monsters to reach that weight
Choice 1: Implement a brute force algorithm that tries every possible combination of eating actions to see if we can arrive at the final queue configuration. This would involve recursively checking every possible action for each monster in the queue. Time complexity would likely be factorial in the worst case, and space complexity would be linear with the depth of the recursion stack.
