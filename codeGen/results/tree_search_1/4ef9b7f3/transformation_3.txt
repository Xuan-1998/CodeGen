Determine the order of 'eating' events that will transform the initial queue into the final queue by making the most efficient choice at each step, considering the weights of the monsters and the desired final weights.
For each monster in the final queue, look for a sequence of monsters in the initial queue that add up to its weight. If such a sequence is found, the optimal choice is to merge these initial queue monsters. This greedy strategy relies on the fact that combining smaller monsters can only lead to a monster equal to or larger than the target but never smaller.
