Construct a sequence of actions that will combine the initial monsters' weights to match the final queue's weights, ensuring that each action is the best possible move to reduce the size of the initial queue while achieving the final queue's configuration.
Iterate through the final queue and for each weight, check both the leftmost and rightmost possible combinations in the initial queue that could sum up to the weight. Choose the combination that allows for the most number of monsters to be eaten. Keep track of the choices and continue until the final queue is replicated or no more combinations are possible.
