Find the optimal sequence of monsters eating each other to arrive at the final queue configuration. The structure of the solution is a sequence of moves specifying which monster eats the one in front or behind it.
Choose the monster in the initial queue that matches the weight of the first monster in the final queue and check if it can consume adjacent monsters to reach that weight
Choice 2: Use a greedy approach that starts from the first monster in the final queue and tries to build it up from the initial queue by finding the smallest index monster that can achieve the required weight through eating its neighbors. If a match is found, remove the eaten monsters from the queue and continue with the next monster in the final queue. This algorithm would have a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(n), considering we need to keep track of the current state of the queue and the operations performed.
