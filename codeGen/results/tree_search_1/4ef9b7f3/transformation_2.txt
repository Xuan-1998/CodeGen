Determine the order of 'eating' events that will transform the initial queue into the final queue by making the most efficient choice at each step, considering the weights of the monsters and the desired final weights.
Starting from the end of the final queue, attempt to match the final monsters with the initial ones. If a monster can be formed by combining consecutive monsters from the initial queue, it is a locally optimal step to merge them. This process is repeated until all monsters in the final queue are accounted for or a mismatch occurs.
