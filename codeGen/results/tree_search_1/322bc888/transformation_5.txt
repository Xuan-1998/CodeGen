parsing the string to count operations required
Choice 1: Use a dynamic programming approach to precompute the number of operations required for each possible substring. Store the results in a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations for the substring s[i:j+1]. Then, answer each query in O(1) by referring to the precomputed values.
