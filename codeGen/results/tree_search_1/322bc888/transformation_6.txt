parsing the string to count operations required
Choice 2: Precompute the results for all substrings starting at each index using a 1D array where each element at index i represents the number of operations needed to make the substring starting at i beautiful up to the end of the string. Answer queries by calculating the minimum operations for the range [l_i, r_i] by comparing precomputed values at l_i and r_i.
