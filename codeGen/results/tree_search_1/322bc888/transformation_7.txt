parsing the string to count operations required
Choice 3: Avoid precomputation altogether and process each query independently. For a given query [l_i, r_i], iterate through the substring, and count the number of operations needed to prevent palindrome formation on the fly. This method optimizes for space complexity but might be slower due to the overhead of processing each query separately.
