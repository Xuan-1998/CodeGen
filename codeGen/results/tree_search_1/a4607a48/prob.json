"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given a two-dimensional universe represented by a rectangular grid with n lines and m columns, where each cell can either be occupied by a static particle or be empty, calculate the average lifespan of a dynamic particle. The dynamic particle appears in a random empty cell and moves to a randomly chosen destination cell along the shortest path through the cells unoccupied by the static particles. The particle disappears upon reaching the destination cell.\\n\\nInput: The input consists of two integers n and m representing the size of the universe, followed by n lines each containing m symbols representing the universe without dynamic particles. The symbol 'X' represents a static particle and '.' represents an empty cell. The input is provided through standard input.\\n\\nOutput: Calculate the average lifespan of a dynamic particle with an accuracy of at least 6 decimal places. The output should be provided to standard output.\\n\\nConstraints: 2 \\u2264 n, m \\u2264 1000. The described universe satisfies the properties described above, that is no two static particles can be in one column or in one row, besides, they can't be positioned in the diagonally adjacent cells.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Dynamic programming', 'Mathematics']\", \"difficulties\": \"VERY_HARD\", \"source\": \"codeforces\", \"url\": \"https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/57/D\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": \"4 5\\n.....\\n.....\\n.....\\n.....\\n\", \"output\": \"2.8500000000\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"8 10\\n..........\\n..........\\n..........\\n..........\\n..........\\n..........\\n..X.......\\n..........\\n\", \"output\": \"5.9387918603\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"10 10\\n..........\\n..........\\n.....X....\\n..........\\n.........X\\n..........\\n..........\\n..........\\n..........\\n..........\\n\", \"output\": \"6.6334860475\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"10 7\\n.......\\n......X\\n.......\\n.......\\n.......\\n.......\\n.......\\n.......\\n.......\\n.......\\n\", \"output\": \"5.5584961143\\n\"}, {\"input\": \"5 2\\n..\\n.X\\n..\\nX.\\n..\\n\", \"output\": \"2.6250000000\\n\"}]}"
