The lifespan of a dynamic particle starting at each empty cell and calculating its average path length to all other empty cells.
dp(i, j) = (dist(i, j, i+1, j) + dist(i, j, i-1, j) + dist(i, j, i, j+1) + dist(i, j, i, j-1)) / 4 if cell (i, j) is empty, where dist(a, b, c, d) calculates the shortest path from (a, b) to (c, d)
