The shortest path length from each empty cell to every other empty cell considering the obstacles.
Use a 2D table dp[x][y] to store the shortest path from each cell (x, y) to every other cell, updating it as you compute paths to avoid recalculating
For each empty cell, use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path to every other empty cell. Store the results in a dp table. After running Dijkstra's from each empty cell, accumulate the distances and calculate their average to determine the average lifespan of a dynamic particle.
