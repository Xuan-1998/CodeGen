The shortest path length from each empty cell to every other empty cell considering the obstacles.
Use a 2D table dp[x][y] to store the shortest path from each cell (x, y) to every other cell, updating it as you compute paths to avoid recalculating
Start at each empty cell and perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path to every other empty cell, storing the distances in a dp table. After completing BFS from all starting points, sum and average the stored distances to find the average lifespan of a dynamic particle.
