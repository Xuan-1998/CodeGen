The shortest path length from each empty cell to every other empty cell considering the obstacles.
Use a 2D table dp[x][y] to store the shortest path from each cell (x, y) to every other cell, updating it as you compute paths to avoid recalculating
Use Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest path between all pairs of empty cells. Store the shortest distances in a dp table. After calculating all pair shortest paths, sum and average these distances to compute the average lifespan of a dynamic particle.
