Subproblem defined by dp[i][j] as the number of cells containing mice that scare the elephant up to that point, with the elephant currently at cell (i, j) and taking the minimum path to reach there.
Set dp[0][0] to 0 as the starting point does not scare the elephant. For the rest of the first row and first column, set dp[i][0] and dp[0][j] based on whether there is a mouse in the cells adjacent to the left and above, respectively.
