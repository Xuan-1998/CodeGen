"{\"statement\": \"Task: Given a board of size n x m, find the minimum number of cells containing mice that scare a little elephant while it travels from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the board. The elephant can only move right or down, and a cell can contain a mouse that scares the elephant if it is adjacent to any cell that the elephant has passed through.\\n\\nInput: The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and m, the size of the board, followed by n lines each containing m digits 0 or 1 representing the cells of the board. The input is provided through standard input.\\n\\nOutput: The output should contain T lines, where each line contains a single integer representing the minimum number of cells containing mice that scare the elephant for the corresponding test case.\\n\\nConstraints: 1 \\u2264 T \\u2264 50, 2 \\u2264 n, m \\u2264 100. The cells of the board can only contain the digits 0 or 1.\", \"editorial\": \"\", \"tag\": \"['Dynamic programming']\", \"difficulties\": \"MEDIUM_HARD\", \"source\": \"codechef\", \"url\": \"https://www.codechef.com/problems/LEMOUSE\", \"sample_test_cases\": [{\"input\": [\"2\", \"3 9\", \"001000001\", \"111111010\", \"100100100\", \"7 9\", \"010101110\", \"110110111\", \"010011111\", \"100100000\", \"000010100\", \"011011000\", \"000100101\"], \"output\": [\"9\", \"10\"]}, {\"input\": \"2\\n3 9\\n001000001\\n111111010\\n100100100\\n7 9\\n010101110\\n110110111\\n010011111\\n100100000\\n000010100\\n011011000\\n000100101\", \"output\": \"9\\n10\"}]}"
