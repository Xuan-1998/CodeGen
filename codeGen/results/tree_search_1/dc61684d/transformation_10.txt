Choose an arbitrary vertex as the starting point.
Sort all the edges of the graph by their weight in non-decreasing order and select the edge with the lowest weight that connects to an unvisited vertex
Implement Bor≈Øvka's algorithm that starts with each vertex as a separate component and repeatedly merges components by the smallest edge connecting different components to avoid cycles.
