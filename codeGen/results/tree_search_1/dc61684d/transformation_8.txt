Choose an arbitrary vertex as the starting point.
Sort all the edges of the graph by their weight in non-decreasing order and select the edge with the lowest weight that connects to an unvisited vertex
Use Kruskal's algorithm to add the edges in sorted order, but if adding an edge would create a cycle, discard it.
