Choose an arbitrary vertex as the starting point.
Sort all the edges of the graph by their weight in non-decreasing order and select the edge with the lowest weight that connects to an unvisited vertex
Apply Prim's algorithm, which grows the spanning tree from the chosen starting vertex by adding the smallest edge that connects the tree to another vertex without creating a cycle.
