Adjacency Matrix: An adjacency matrix is a 2D array where the entry at row i and column j indicates whether there is an edge from chapter i to chapter j. This is beneficial for dense graphs and allows for quick checks of whether a dependency exists between two chapters, but can be inefficient in terms of space for sparse graphs.
For disconnected components, ensure that each component is processed separately. If any component contains a cycle, then it's impossible to understand the whole book. Otherwise, calculate the minimum reads for each component and take the maximum as the answer.
