Adjacency Matrix: An adjacency matrix is a 2D array where the entry at row i and column j indicates whether there is an edge from chapter i to chapter j. This is beneficial for dense graphs and allows for quick checks of whether a dependency exists between two chapters, but can be inefficient in terms of space for sparse graphs.
Use a topological sort algorithm to determine the order in which to read the chapters. This only works for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). If the graph is not a DAG (i.e., a cycle is detected), return -1 as it's impossible to read all chapters.
