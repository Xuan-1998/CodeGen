Adjacency Matrix: An adjacency matrix is a 2D array where the entry at row i and column j indicates whether there is an edge from chapter i to chapter j. This is beneficial for dense graphs and allows for quick checks of whether a dependency exists between two chapters, but can be inefficient in terms of space for sparse graphs.
Check for cycles in the graph using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. If a cycle is found, it means it's impossible to read the book in a linear fashion and understand all chapters, hence the output should be -1.
