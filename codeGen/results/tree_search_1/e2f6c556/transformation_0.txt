Adjacency List: An adjacency list represents the graph as a list where each index corresponds to a chapter. Each element at an index is a list of chapters that are required to understand the chapter corresponding to that index. This is efficient for sparse graphs and is useful when we need to iterate over the edges of a specific vertex.
