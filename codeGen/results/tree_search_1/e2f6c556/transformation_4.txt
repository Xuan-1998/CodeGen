Edge List: An edge list represents the graph as a list of tuples (or lists), where each tuple contains two nodes (chapters) that have a dependency. This representation is simple and is often used when the graph is going to be processed as a whole or when edges need to be frequently added or removed.
Dynamic Programming with Topological Sort: After performing a topological sort using either DFS or Kahn's Algorithm, use dynamic programming to determine the minimum number of times the book needs to be read. Iterate over the sorted nodes and update a counter for each node based on the maximum value among all its prerequisites.
