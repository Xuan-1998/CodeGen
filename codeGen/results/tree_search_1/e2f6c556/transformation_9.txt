Adjacency List: An adjacency list represents the graph as a list where each index corresponds to a chapter. Each element at an index is a list of chapters that are required to understand the chapter corresponding to that index. This is efficient for sparse graphs and is useful when we need to iterate over the edges of a specific vertex.
topological sorting with cycle detection
Use stress testing by generating large graphs with a number of nodes and edges close to the maximum limits specified in the problem statement, and evaluate the algorithm's efficiency and responsiveness under high-load conditions.
