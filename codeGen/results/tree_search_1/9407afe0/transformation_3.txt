Calculate the number of different ways 'Team A' can win 0, 1, 2, or 3 sets and their opponent can win 0, 1, or 2 sets to determine the possible match scores.
Define base cases for scenarios where the number of sets won by either team reaches the match winning condition (3 sets for 'Team A' or the opponent).
