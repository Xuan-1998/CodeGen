Check if a given set score is possible by comparing it to the minimum and maximum possible scores for a set, considering the special rules for the final set.
Use a dictionary with keys as tuples (sets_won_by_team_a, sets_won_by_opponent) and values as a Boolean indicating if it is possible to reach that score. This allows for sparse storage if not all combinations are relevant.
