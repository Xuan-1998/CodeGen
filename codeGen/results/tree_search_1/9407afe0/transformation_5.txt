Determine the possible outcomes of each set (win or loss for 'Team A') given the total points scored by both teams, and then combine these outcomes to form valid match scores.
dp[x][y] stores the minimum number of sets needed for 'Team A' to have x wins and their opponent to have y wins. The recurrence relation is dp[x][y] = 1 + min(dp[x-1][y], dp[x][y-1]), assuming that the current set is won by either 'Team A' or their opponent.
