Determine the possible outcomes of each set (win or loss for 'Team A') given the total points scored by both teams, and then combine these outcomes to form valid match scores.
dp[i][j] represents the best score for 'Team A' after i sets with j wins for 'Team A'. The recurrence is dp[i][j] = min/max(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j]) depending on the outcome of the ith set.
