Check if a given set score is possible by comparing it to the minimum and maximum possible scores for a set, considering the special rules for the final set.
Use a 2D list where rows represent the number of sets won by 'Team A' and columns represent the number of sets won by the opponent. Each cell will store a tuple of Boolean values indicating whether a particular match score is achievable.
For each possible match score, reconstruct the path of set scores that would result in 'Team A' winning those sets, ensuring that the set score conditions are met for standard and final sets.
