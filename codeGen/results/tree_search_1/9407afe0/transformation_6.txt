Determine the possible outcomes of each set (win or loss for 'Team A') given the total points scored by both teams, and then combine these outcomes to form valid match scores.
Let dp[i][aWins][bWins] be the best match score for 'Team A' after i sets, where aWins is the number of sets won by 'Team A' and bWins is the number of sets won by their opponent. The recurrence relation is: dp[i][aWins][bWins] = min/max(dp[i-1][aWins-1][bWins], dp[i-1][aWins][bWins-1]), depending on the winner of the ith set.
