Check if a given set score is possible by comparing it to the minimum and maximum possible scores for a set, considering the special rules for the final set.
Use a 2D list where rows represent the number of sets won by 'Team A' and columns represent the number of sets won by the opponent. Each cell will store a tuple of Boolean values indicating whether a particular match score is achievable.
Trace back from the winning scenarios (i.e., 'Team A' winning 3 sets or the opponent winning 3 sets) and find the sequence of set scores that could have led to the final match score.
