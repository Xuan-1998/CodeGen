Check if a given set score is possible by comparing it to the minimum and maximum possible scores for a set, considering the special rules for the final set.
Implement a 3D list where the first dimension represents the number of sets won by 'Team A', the second dimension represents the number of sets won by the opponent, and the third dimension represents the number of sets played so far. Each cell stores a Boolean value indicating the possibility of achieving that score within the given number of sets.
