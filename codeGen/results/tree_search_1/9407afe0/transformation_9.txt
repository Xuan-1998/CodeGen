Check if a given set score is possible by comparing it to the minimum and maximum possible scores for a set, considering the special rules for the final set.
Use a 2D list where rows represent the number of sets won by 'Team A' and columns represent the number of sets won by the opponent. Each cell will store a tuple of Boolean values indicating whether a particular match score is achievable.
Starting from the potential end scores (e.g., '3:0', '3:1', '3:2', '0:3', '1:3', '2:3'), backtrack to find all possible combinations of set scores that could result in each match score, checking against the computed table to ensure feasibility.
