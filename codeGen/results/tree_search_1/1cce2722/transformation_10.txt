Let dp[i] be the maximum number of points that can be earned considering elements up to i, where i is the value of the elements, not their position in the sequence.
Use a list named 'dp' of length max(ai) + 1, initialized with zeros. This list will store the maximum score for each possible element value.
Use a bottom-up approach to fill the dp table. For each value i from 2 to the maximum element value, update dp[i] by comparing dp[i-1] (if we do not choose element i) with dp[i-2] plus the product of i and the frequency of i in the sequence (if we choose element i). The dp table will be filled sequentially, and the last element of dp will hold the maximum points that can be achieved.
