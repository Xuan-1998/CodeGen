Let dp[i] be the maximum number of points that can be earned considering elements up to i, where i is the value of the elements, not their position in the sequence.
Use a list named 'dp' of length max(ai) + 1, initialized with zeros. This list will store the maximum score for each possible element value.
Start from the second value in the dp table and update it as the maximum between the current dp[i] and the sum of dp[i-2] and the points gained from deleting the current value i (which is i * count[i]). Continue this process up to the last value in the dp table.
