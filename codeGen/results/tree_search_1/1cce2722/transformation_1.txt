Let dp[i] be the maximum number of points that can be earned considering elements up to i, where i is the value of the elements, not their position in the sequence.
Allocate an array 'dp' using numpy for better performance, especially if the range of ai is large. Initialize all values to -1 to indicate that the subproblem has not been solved yet.
