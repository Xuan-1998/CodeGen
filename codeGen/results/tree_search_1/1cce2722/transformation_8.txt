Let dp[i] be the maximum number of points that can be earned considering elements up to i, where i is the value of the elements, not their position in the sequence.
Use a list named 'dp' of length max(ai) + 1, initialized with zeros. This list will store the maximum score for each possible element value.
Iterate over the range from 1 to the maximum element value in the input sequence. For each i, calculate dp[i] as the maximum of dp[i-1] (if we don't take the current value) and dp[i-2] + i * count[i] (if we take the current value, where count[i] is the number of times i appears in the sequence).
