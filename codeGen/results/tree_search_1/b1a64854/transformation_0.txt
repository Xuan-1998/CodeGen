Create a DP table where each entry dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum for a submatrix with dimensions i x j. Overlapping subproblems occur when computing the minimum sum for different submatrices that share common sub-submatrices.
For each cell (i, j), consider it as the bottom-right corner of the largest square submatrix. The state dp[i][j] could be obtained by checking the minimum sum for the submatrix excluding the current row or column, i.e., dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1], and adding the necessary adjustments for the new row and column.
