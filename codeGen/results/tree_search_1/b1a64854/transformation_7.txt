For each cell (i, j), define the subproblem as finding the minimum value for the cell such that the sum of values in row i is equal to the sum of values in column j.
Use a 2D array where dp[i][j] holds the minimum sum for the sub-matrix of size i x j
For each cell (i, j), if i == j, then dp[i][j] = i since we need equal sum of row i and column j. Otherwise, set dp[i][j] to min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + 1.
