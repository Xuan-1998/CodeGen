Use two separate DP arrays, one to store the minimum sum of rows up to row i (rowDp[i]) and another to store the minimum sum of columns up to column j (colDp[j]). The overlapping subproblems are the scenarios where calculating the minimum sum for a row or column involves previous rows or columns that have already been computed.
Use a greedy approach within the dynamic programming framework, always placing 1s in a cell (i, j) to balance the sum of row i with the sum of column j, and keep track of minimum sums using two DP arrays.
