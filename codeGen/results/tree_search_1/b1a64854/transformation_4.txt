Consider each possible sum S that a row or a column can have, from 0 to min(N, M), and define the subproblem as finding the minimum sum of values for the matrix given that each row and column sums up to S.
Define the subproblem for each possible sum S for a row or column, initialize the base cases for S = 0, and build the solution iteratively for increasing values of S using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach.
