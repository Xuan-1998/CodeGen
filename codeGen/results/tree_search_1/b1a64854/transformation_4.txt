Define a recursive function that computes the minimum sum for a given matrix size N x M, where the function calls itself with smaller matrix sizes (e.g., (N-1) x M, N x (M-1)). The overlapping subproblems are the repeated calculations of the minimum sum for these smaller matrices.
Implement a one-dimensional list for each row and column, row_dp[N+1] and col_dp[M+1], to store the minimum sum of the respective subproblems, and update them as you iterate through the rows and columns.
