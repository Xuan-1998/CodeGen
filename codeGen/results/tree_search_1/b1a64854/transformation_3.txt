Divide the matrix into smaller submatrices, and for each submatrix of size a x b, define the subproblem as finding the minimum sum of values such that the sums of rows are equal to the sums of columns within the submatrix.
Consider a subproblem where dp[x] represents the minimum sum of values for a matrix with x filled cells, where x is the minimum of row sum and column sum. The recurrence relation would depend on the choices made to fill the next cell to maintain the balance between row and column sums.
