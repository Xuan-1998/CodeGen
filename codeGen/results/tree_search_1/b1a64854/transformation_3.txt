Define a recursive function that computes the minimum sum for a given matrix size N x M, where the function calls itself with smaller matrix sizes (e.g., (N-1) x M, N x (M-1)). The overlapping subproblems are the repeated calculations of the minimum sum for these smaller matrices.
Create a dictionary with keys as tuples (i, j) representing the size of the submatrix, and values as the computed minimum sum for that submatrix size.
