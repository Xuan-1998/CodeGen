Divide the matrix into smaller submatrices, and for each submatrix of size a x b, define the subproblem as finding the minimum sum of values such that the sums of rows are equal to the sums of columns within the submatrix.
Let dp[i][j] represent the minimum sum of values when considering the first i rows and the first j columns. Establish the recurrence relation by considering the contribution of the (i, j) cell to the row i and column j sums.
