Define a recursive function that computes the minimum sum for a given matrix size N x M, where the function calls itself with smaller matrix sizes (e.g., (N-1) x M, N x (M-1)). The overlapping subproblems are the repeated calculations of the minimum sum for these smaller matrices.
Use a two-dimensional list (table) with dimensions N+1 by M+1, where each entry table[i][j] holds the minimum sum for the subproblem matrix size i x j.
