Create a DP table where each entry dp[i][j] represents the minimum sum for a submatrix with dimensions i x j. Overlapping subproblems occur when computing the minimum sum for different submatrices that share common sub-submatrices.
The recursive relation considers the cases when the last row or column can be filled with all 1s or all 0s. For each cell (i, j), calculate dp[i][j] based on the minimum of dp[i-1][j] + j (assuming the ith row is filled with 1s) and dp[i][j-1] + i (assuming the jth column is filled with 1s).
