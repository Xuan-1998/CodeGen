Divide the matrix into smaller submatrices, and for each submatrix of size a x b, define the subproblem as finding the minimum sum of values such that the sums of rows are equal to the sums of columns within the submatrix.
Define subproblems based on the number of filled rows and columns, and let dp[r][c] be the minimum sum of values for a r x c submatrix. Then, consider how filling the next row and column affects the sum.
