Consider each possible sum S that a row or a column can have, from 0 to min(N, M), and define the subproblem as finding the minimum sum of values for the matrix given that each row and column sums up to S.
Construct a matrix of subproblems where each cell represents the minimum sum for a specific row and column sum S, and use a bottom-up approach to fill in this matrix starting from the simplest cases.
