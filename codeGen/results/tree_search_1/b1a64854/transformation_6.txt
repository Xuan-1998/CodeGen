Use two separate DP arrays, one to store the minimum sum of rows up to row i (rowDp[i]) and another to store the minimum sum of columns up to column j (colDp[j]). The overlapping subproblems are the scenarios where calculating the minimum sum for a row or column involves previous rows or columns that have already been computed.
Start by initializing all cells to 0. Then, iteratively assign 1s to the cells (i, j) where the current sum of row i is less than the sum of column j, and update the DP state until row sums equal column sums.
