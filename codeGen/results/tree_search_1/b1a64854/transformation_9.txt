For each cell (i, j), define the subproblem as finding the minimum value for the cell such that the sum of values in row i is equal to the sum of values in column j.
Use a 2D array where dp[i][j] holds the minimum sum for the sub-matrix of size i x j
For each cell (i, j), if i != j, then the cell (i, j) contributes 0 to the sum. If i == j, then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1. The final answer for the original problem is dp[N][M].
