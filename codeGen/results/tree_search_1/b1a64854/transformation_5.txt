Consider each possible sum S that a row or a column can have, from 0 to min(N, M), and define the subproblem as finding the minimum sum of values for the matrix given that each row and column sums up to S.
Use a top-down dynamic programming approach with memoization to solve for the minimum sum of values for each row and column sum S, starting from the largest subproblems and breaking them down recursively.
