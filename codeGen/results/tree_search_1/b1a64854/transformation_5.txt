Use two separate DP arrays, one to store the minimum sum of rows up to row i (rowDp[i]) and another to store the minimum sum of columns up to column j (colDp[j]). The overlapping subproblems are the scenarios where calculating the minimum sum for a row or column involves previous rows or columns that have already been computed.
For every cell (i, j), make the binary decision of putting a 1 or 0 based on minimizing the difference between the sum of row i and the sum of column j. Use DP to remember the minimum sums for each row and column.
