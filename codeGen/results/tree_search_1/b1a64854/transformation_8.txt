For each cell (i, j), define the subproblem as finding the minimum value for the cell such that the sum of values in row i is equal to the sum of values in column j.
Use a 2D array where dp[i][j] holds the minimum sum for the sub-matrix of size i x j
Initialize the base cases dp[i][0] and dp[0][j] to 0 since the sum of values in a row or column with no cells is zero. Then for i > 0 and j > 0, if i == j, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1, else dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]).
