parsing
Convert the string into a list of characters for faster access if needed. Use two pointers to scan the string from left to right and right to left simultaneously, looking for 'AB' and 'BA'. If both are found in one pass without overlapping, return 'YES'. If not, return 'NO'. Ensure to handle cases where string conversions and two-pointer traversal give benefits over simple iteration.
