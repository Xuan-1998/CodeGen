parsing
Iterate through the string while keeping track of the index where 'AB' is found. Once 'AB' is found, continue searching for 'BA'. If found, check if the index is non-overlapping with the 'AB' index (i.e., the 'BA' index is not immediately next to 'AB' index). Repeat the process with 'BA' first and then 'AB'.
