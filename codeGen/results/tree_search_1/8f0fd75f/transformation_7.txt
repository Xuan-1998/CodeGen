For each possible position to add the new ordinary point, compute the minimum additional durability required so that the construction does not collapse when this point takes some of the load from its neighbors.
dp[i] = 0 if no additional point is needed at position i or equals to the minimum of the dp values of its neighboring segments plus the additional durability required to support the segment at i without collapsing
