For each ordinary point, consider the maximum length of the ceiling it can support to the left and right without collapsing. Store these values to compute the state of the building as other points collapse.
Use a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum durability required for a subsegment starting at i and ending at j.
Calculate the maximum span each point can support initially. Then, progressively remove the weakest points and redistribute the load to adjacent points, updating the maximum span they can support. Finally, determine the minimum additional durability required from this process.
