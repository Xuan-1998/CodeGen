For each segment between two bearing points, calculate the minimum durability required for an ordinary point so that it can support the segment without collapsing. Use prefix and suffix sums to update these values dynamically as points collapse.
Base case: If there are no ordinary points between two bearing points, the durability of a new point must be at least the distance between these bearing points.
