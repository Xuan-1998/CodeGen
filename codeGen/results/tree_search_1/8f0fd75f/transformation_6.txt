For each possible position to add the new ordinary point, compute the minimum additional durability required so that the construction does not collapse when this point takes some of the load from its neighbors.
dp[i] = min(dp[j] + cost_to_add_point_between(j, i) for j in range(i)) to ensure no segment exceeds its durability
