For each segment between two bearing points, calculate the minimum durability required for an ordinary point so that it can support the segment without collapsing. Use prefix and suffix sums to update these values dynamically as points collapse.
Base case: If all ordinary points have collapsed, the minimum durability required for a new point is the total length of the ceiling.
