For each ordinary point, consider the maximum length of the ceiling it can support to the left and right without collapsing. Store these values to compute the state of the building as other points collapse.
Use a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum durability required for a subsegment starting at i and ending at j.
Perform a binary search on the minimum durability required for the additional point. For each guess, simulate the point addition and check if the bearing points can be connected without collapsing the building. Adjust the guess based on the simulation results.
