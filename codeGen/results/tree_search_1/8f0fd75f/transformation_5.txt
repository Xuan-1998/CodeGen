For each possible position to add the new ordinary point, compute the minimum additional durability required so that the construction does not collapse when this point takes some of the load from its neighbors.
dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[i], dp[i+1]) + extra_durability_needed if adding a point at position i
