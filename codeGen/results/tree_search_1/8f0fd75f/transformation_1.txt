For each ordinary point, consider the maximum length of the ceiling it can support to the left and right without collapsing. Store these values to compute the state of the building as other points collapse.
Utilize a dictionary with tuples as keys where each key (i, j) represents a segment from point i to j, and the value represents the minimum durability needed for the segment.
