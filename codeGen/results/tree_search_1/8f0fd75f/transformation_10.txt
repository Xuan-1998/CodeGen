For each ordinary point, consider the maximum length of the ceiling it can support to the left and right without collapsing. Store these values to compute the state of the building as other points collapse.
Use a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum durability required for a subsegment starting at i and ending at j.
Use a greedy approach to place the additional point at the position that maximizes the reduction of load on the weakest ordinary point. Repeat this process, recalculating the weakest point each time, until the bearing points are connected.
