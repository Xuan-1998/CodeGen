For each segment between two bearing points, calculate the minimum durability required for an ordinary point so that it can support the segment without collapsing. Use prefix and suffix sums to update these values dynamically as points collapse.
Base case: If there is only one ordinary point between two bearing points, check if the point's durability is sufficient to support the segments on both sides.
