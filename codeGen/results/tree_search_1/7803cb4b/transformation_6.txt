dp[i][j][k] represents the minimum possible length of the subarray a[i...j] after performing the operation, where k is the last number added to the subarray
Use recursion with memoization to compute the minimum length of a subarray a[i...j] with a last number k. The function should try to merge the last two elements if they are equal, or try to replace a pair of equal neighboring elements with their incremented value.
