dp[i][j][k] represents the minimum possible length of the subarray a[i...j] after performing the operation, where k is the last number added to the subarray
Iteratively fill the DP table in bottom-up manner, starting with the base case of length 1 subarrays (which cannot be reduced) and then considering all subarrays of length 2 and more, checking for every possible length of the left and right partitions within the current subarray.
