dp[i][j] represents the minimum possible length of the subarray a[i...j] after performing the operation
dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]  # Create a 2D array initialized to 0, where n is the length of the input array
use the dp table to identify which pairs were merged and output the operations needed to achieve the minimum length
