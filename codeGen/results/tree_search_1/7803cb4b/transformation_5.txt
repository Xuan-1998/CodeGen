dp[i][j][k] represents the minimum possible length of the subarray a[i...j] after performing the operation, where k is the last number added to the subarray
Iterate over all possible subarray lengths, for each subarray length iterate over all possible starting points. For each subarray a[i...j], iterate over all possible k to find the minimum possible length after the operation.
