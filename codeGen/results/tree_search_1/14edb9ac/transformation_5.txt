adjacency list
{'vertex': 1, 'neighbours': []}
Test the algorithm on trees that represent edge cases, such as a linear chain (where the tree is essentially a straight line), star-shaped trees (where one vertex is connected to all others), and balanced binary trees. This will help ensure the algorithm handles different tree structures robustly.
