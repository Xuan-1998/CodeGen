The binary numbers $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and do not contain leading zeros. Both $a$ and $b$ are less than $2^{10^5}$.\n\nOutput: Output a single integer, the required sum modulo $10^9+7$.\n\nConstraints: $1\\leq a<2^{10^{5}}$, $1\\leq b<2^{10^{5}}$.", "editorial": "", "tag": "['Dynamic programming']", "difficulties": "MEDIUM", "source": "hackerrank", "url": "https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/xor-and-sum/problem", "sample_test_cases": [{"input": "10\n1010\n", "output": "489429555\n"}]}
