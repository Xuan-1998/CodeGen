{"statement": "Task: Given an integer n, find the nth value in the Tribonacci sequence, which is defined as T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1, and Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n >= 0.\n\nInput: The input is a single integer n, which represents the index of the desired value in the sequence. The input is provided through standard input.\n\nOutput: The output should be a single integer, which represents the value of Tn.\n\nConstraints: The input integer n must satisfy the constraint 0 <= n <= 37. Additionally, the output value is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit integer. The Tribonacci sequence is defined recursively, where each term is the sum of the previous three terms.", "editorial": "", "tag": "['Dynamic programming', 'Mathematics']", "difficulties": "EASY", "source": "leetcode", "url": "https://leetcode.com/problems/n-th-tribonacci-number/", "sample_test_cases": [{"input": [4], "output": 4}]}
