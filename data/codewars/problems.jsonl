{"statement": "Task: Implement a memoization solution to optimize the calculation of Fibonacci numbers. The goal is to keep using the tree recursion algorithm while avoiding the inefficiencies of recalculating Fibonacci numbers. The solution involves storing Fibonacci numbers in a cache data structure and looking them up before recalculating. The task is to refactor the function into a recursive Fibonacci function that uses a memoized data structure.\n\nInput: The input for the function is not relevant to the problem statement, as the function is already provided. However, it is mentioned that the input is not used in the memoization solution. Input arrives from standard input.\n\nOutput: The function should return the Fibonacci number for a given input.\n\nConstraints: There are no input constraints mentioned in the problem statement.", "editorial": "", "tag": "['Dynamic programming']", "difficulties": "EASY", "source": "codewars", "url": "https://www.codewars.com/kata/529adbf7533b761c560004e5", "sample_test_cases": [{"input": [70], "output": [190392490709135]}, {"input": [60], "output": [1548008755920]}, {"input": [50], "output": [12586269025]}]}
